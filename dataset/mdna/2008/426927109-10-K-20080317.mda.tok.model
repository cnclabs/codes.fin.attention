item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary this summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the company 
when evaluating financial condition and performance  management looks at certain key metrics and measures 
the company s evaluation includes comparisons with peer group financial institutions and with its own performance objectives established in the internal planning process 
the primary activity of the company is commercial banking 
the company s operations are located entirely in the southern and eastern regions of the general san francisco bay area of california in the counties of santa clara  alameda and contra costa 
the largest city in this area is san jose and the company s market includes the headquarters of a number of technology based companies in the region known commonly as silicon valley 
the company s customers are primarily closely held businesses and professionals 
performance overview net income in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in net income in was million higher than net income of million 
net income per diluted share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets was and return on average equity was in  as compared to and  respectively for  and and  respectively in the company s return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible equity were and  respectively  for  compared to and  respectively  for  and and  respectively  for the following are major factors impacting the company s results of operations in recent years net interest income increased by million  or  in  and by million  or  in the growth in was largely driven by an increase in average interest earning assets and the growth in was largely driven by an increased rate on earning assets 
noninterest income decreased by in from the company s changed its strategy regarding its sba loan business 
the company is now retaining most of its sba production in lieu of selling loans 
the company s noninterest income declined in as a result of the change in strategy 
the efficiency ratio was in  compared to in and in the higher efficiency ratio in reflects the additional senior level bankers and a new sba team the company hired during and costs associated with the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
noninterest expense increased to million in  compared to million in and million in charges relative to the diablo valley bank acquisition accounted for million of the increase  including  for intangible asset amortization   of consulting agreement expense   of non compete agreement expense  and compensation expense of  for employees who are no longer with the company 
compensation expense increased in compared to a year ago 
the increase in compensation expense was primarily due to the merger with diablo valley bank  the addition of senior level bankers and hiring of a new sba team during up front costs associated with the hiring of new bankers for the east bay expansion and sba team totaled  in a credit provision for loan losses of  was recorded in  compared to a credit provision of  in and a provision of  in this is the result of a general improvement in credit quality and recoveries in of loans previously charged off 
the following are important factors in understanding our current financial condition and liquidity position total assets increased million  or  to billion at the end of from billion at the end of the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
total loans increased million  or  to billion at the end of total loans were million at the end of the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of diablo valley bank and the addition of several experienced loan producers hired in the fourth quarter 
nonperforming assets remained at nominal levels 
nonperforming assets were million  or of total assets  at december   compared to million  or of total assets  at december   and million  or of total assets  at december  approximately million of the nonperforming loans at year end of were acquired in the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
total deposits increased million  or  to billion at the end of from million at the end of the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
deposits growth in deposits is an important metric management uses to measure market share 
the company s depositors are predominately located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company will occasionally obtain deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
the company had million in brokered deposits at december  the company also seeks deposits from title insurance companies and real estate exchange facilitators 
the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to concentrations 
the company s acquisition of diablo valley bank during resulted a significant growth in deposits and expanded the company s market area 
lending our lending business originates primarily through our branch offices located in our primary market 
the economy in our primary service area continued to stabilize in commercial loans increased from december  due to increased marketing focus and the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
commercial real estate mortgage loans slightly increased from december  primarily due to general improvements in commercial income property markets and the diablo valley bank acquisition 
we will continue to use and improve existing products to expand market share at current locations  including our new branch in walnut creek  california that opened in net interest income the management of interest income and interest expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company s total revenue 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
because of its focus on commercial lending to closely held businesses  the company will continue to have a high percentage of floating rate loans and other assets 
given the current volume  mix and repricing characteristics of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  we believe our interest rate spread is expected to increase in a rising rate environment  and decrease in a declining interest rate scenario 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of governors of the federal reserve system reduced short term interest rates by basis points 
this decrease in short term rates immediately affected the rates applicable to the majority of the company s loans 
while the decrease in interest rates also lowered the cost of interest bearing deposits  which represent the company s primary funding source  these deposits tend to reprice more slowly than floating rate loans 
the federal reserve reduced short term interest rates by another points in january reductions in short term interest rates can be expected to negatively affect the company s net interest margin and net interest income  at least in the near term 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail under liquidity and asset liability management 
management of credit risk because of its focus on business banking  loans to single borrowing entities are often larger than would be found in a more consumer oriented bank with many smaller  more homogenous loans 
the average size of its relationships makes the company more susceptible to larger losses 
as a result of this concentration of larger risks  the company has maintained an allowance for loan losses which is substantially higher than would be indicated by its actual historic loss experience 
the company had a reverse provision for loan losses each of the last two years because of a general improvement in credit quality and net recoveries in of loans previously charged off 
a complete discussion of the management of credit risk appears under provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income is an important component 
prior to the third quarter of  a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income was associated with its sba lending activity  as gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained 
however  beginning in the third quarter of  the company started retaining new sba loans in lieu of selling 
as a result  the company s noninterest income declined in compared to sba loan activity includes the origination  sale  and servicing of loans guaranteed by the us department of agriculture 
noninterest income associated with sba activity increased each year from through noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company s performance 
prior to the company had undertaken several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve its efficiency  including a reduction in staff and the consolidation of operations under the common heritage bank brand and restructuring each department 
in  however  the company s efficiency ratio was significantly impacted by the acquisition of diablo valley bank  the hiring of additional experienced bankers and a new sba team 
management monitors progress in reducing expense through the review of the company s efficiency ratio 
the company s efficiency ratio was in compared with in  and in in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized additional expenses of million  representing the present value of term insurance for participants in the company s supplemental executive retirement plan  substantially all of whom have split dollar life insurance agreements with the company 
typically  under the split dollar life insurance agreements  the insureds beneficiary receives of the excess of the death benefit over the cash surrender value of the policy 
this accounting adjustment was undertaken after the company s review of split dollar life insurance agreements and recognition that the company has contractually agreed with each participant to provide a benefit 
this charge reflected the term insurance cost for all insureds 
beginning in  the company will be impacted by the fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements 
this issue requires that a liability be recorded during the service period when a split dollar life insurance agreement continues after participants employment or retirement 
with its existing split dollar life insurance agreements  the company has contractually agreed with each participant to provide life insurance on an ongoing basis 
therefore  the company would have to obtain term insurance for the remainder of the participant s life  or a comparable death benefit if the respective life insurance policy were ever terminated 
the required accrued liability will be based on either the post employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement 
in september  fasb issued statement  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
adoption of statement did not affect the company s financial statements since the company s supplemental retirement plan has no assets and the liability for benefits is measured as of december and recorded on the company s balance sheet 
capital management and share repurchases heritage commerce corp and heritage bank of commerce meet the regulatory definition of well capitalized at december  as part of its asset and liability process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue 
as a part of this process  the company determined in the second quarter of that its capital levels were higher than necessary 
to adjust capital to levels consistent with its view of current market conditions  the company commenced a stock repurchase plan of million in june this repurchase program was completed at the end of third quarter of on february   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of common stock through june  this repurchase program was completed at the end of second quarter of on july   the board of directors authorized to purchase up to million of common stock through july  in  the company initiated the payment of quarterly cash dividends 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per share in  representing of earnings 
the company s general policy is to pay cash dividends within the range of typical peer payout ratios  provided that such payments do not adversely affect our financial condition and are not overly restrictive to our growth capacity 
on january   the company declared an per share quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is non interest income  which primarily consists of loan servicing fees  customer service charges and fees  and increase in cash surrender value of life insurance 
the majority of the company s non interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin in  net interest income was million  an increase of compared to million in the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products which comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid 
the following distribution  rate and yield table presents for each of the past three years  the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company s balance sheet  the average interest rates earned or paid thereon  and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated

average earning assets increased in from this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
the company s net interest margin  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  was in compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price when the company s prime lending rate is changed  in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this causes the company s balance sheet to be asset sensitive which means that  all else being equal  the company s net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
management anticipates that the company s net interest margin could experience some compression if short term interest rates continue to fall in the net interest margin increased basis points to in from in net interest income increased million  or  for to million from million for  primarily due to higher in interest rate levels in provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company sets aside an allowance or reserve for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the income statement as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the loan loss provision is determined by conducting a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current month s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the loan loss provision and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the company s market area 
for  the company had a credit provision for loan losses of  compared to a credit provision for loan losses of million for and provision for loan losses of million for the allowance for loan losses represented  and of total loans at december   and  respectively

noninterest income beginning in the third quarter of  the company decided to change its strategy regarding its sba loan business 
the company is now retaining most new sba production in lieu of selling the loans 
reflecting the strategic shift to retain sba loan production  gains from sale of loans dropped substantially in the following table sets forth the various components of the company s noninterest income noninterest income increase decrease increase decrease year ended december  versus versus dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent gain on sale of sba loans gain on sale capital group loan portfolio n a servicing income increase in cash surrender value of life insurance service charges and fees on deposit accounts gain on sale of leased equipment n a equipment leasing n a other total the decrease in noninterest income in compared to was primarily attributable to a million decrease in gain on sale of loans 
the net gain on sale of sba loans was million for  compared to million for the reduction in noninterest income should be offset in future years with higher interest income  as a result of retaining sba loan production 
for periods the company sold its sba loan production  including the first nine months of  gains or losses on sba loans held for sale were recognized upon completion of the sale  and are based on the difference between the net sales proceeds and the relative fair value of the guaranteed portion of the loan sold compared to the relative fair value of the unguaranteed portion 
the servicing assets that resulted from the sale of sba loans  with servicing rights retained  are amortized over the term of the loans using a method approximating the interest method 
noninterest expense the following table sets forth the various components of the company s noninterest expense noninterest expense increase decrease increase decrease year ended december  versus versus dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent salaries and employee benefits occupancy professional fees advertising and promotion data processing expense low income housing investment losses and writedowns client services furniture and equipment intangible asset amortization n a n a retirement plan expense amortization of leased equipment n a other total the following table indicates the percentage of noninterest expense in each category noninterest expense by category percent percent percent dollars in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total salaries and employee benefits occupancy professional fees advertising and promotion data processing expense low income housing investment losses and writedowns client services furniture and equipment intangible asset amortization retirement plan expense amortization of leased equipment other total noninterest expense increased million  or  in compared to noninterest expense for decreased million  or  from the efficiency ratio represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest and noninterest income 
the company s efficiency ratio was in  as compared to in and in the increase in compensation expense was primarily due to the acquisition of diablo valley bank and the company hiring a number of experienced bankers during salary and severance benefits for former diablo valley bank employees totaled  up front costs associated with the hiring of new bankers for the east bay expansion and sba teams totaled  in the increase in occupancy  furniture and equipment was due to opening a new branch office in walnut creek during  as well as the addition of the diablo valley bank offices 
the increase in professional fees and data processing fees in were due to the acquisition of diablo valley bank and additional branches and customer accounts after the merger with diablo valley bank 
the company also incurred amortization expense of  related to intangible assets from the diablo valley bank acquisition 
income tax expense the company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of such provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt interest income  increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
the company s federal and state income tax expense was million in  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
this represents of income before taxes in  in  and in the effective tax rate is higher in  than in and  because of adjustments in resulting from the audit of the company s california state tax returns by the state of california franchise tax board 
tax exempt interest income is generated primarily by the company s investments in state  county and municipal securities  which provided million in federal tax exempt income in  and although not reflected in the investment portfolio  the company also has total investments of million in low income housing limited partnerships as of december  these investments have generated tax credits for the past few years  with about million in credits available for the tax year and million in tax credits realized in the investments are expected to generate an additional million in aggregate tax credits from through  however  the credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with certainty 
some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as it reverses 
at the end of  the company had a net deferred tax asset of million 
financial condition as of december   total assets were billion  an increase of from billion at year end total securities available for sale at fair value were million  a decrease of from million at year end the total loan portfolio excluding loans held for sale was billion  an increase of from million at year end total deposits were billion  an increase of from million at year end securities sold under agreement to repurchase decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at year end securities portfolio the following table reflects the estimated fair value for each category of securities for the past three years 
investment portfolio december  dollars in thousands securities available for sale at fair value us treasury us government agencies municipals tax exempt mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations total securities classified as us government agencies as of december  were issued by the federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation  and the federal home loan bank

the investment portfolio serves the following purposes i it can be readily reduced in size to provide liquidity for loan balance increases or deposit balance decreases  ii it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender  iii it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool  since it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  iv it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans  and v it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company uses two portfolio classifications for its securities held to maturity  and available for sale 
accounting rules also allow for a trading portfolio classification  but the company has no securities that would be classified as such 
the held to maturity portfolio can consist only of securities that the company has both the intent and ability to hold until maturity  to be sold only in the event of concerns with an issuer s credit worthiness  a change in tax law that eliminates their tax exempt status  or other infrequent situations as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles 
since the company does not have a trading portfolio  the available for sale portfolio is comprised of all securities not included as held to maturity 
even though management currently has the intent and the ability to hold the company s securities for the foreseeable future  they are all currently classified as available for sale to allow flexibility with regard to the active management of the company s investment portfolio 
fasb statement requires available for sale securities to be marked to market with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
monthly adjustments are made to reflect changes in the market value of the company s available for sale securities 
the company s investment portfolio is currently composed primarily of i us treasury and agency issues for liquidity and pledging  ii mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  iii state  county and municipal obligations  which provide tax free income and limited pledging potential  and iv collateralized mortgage obligations  which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio 
the amortized cost of securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law was million and million at december  and  respectively 
except for obligations of the us government or us government agencies  no securities of a single issuer exceeded of shareholders equity at december  the company has not used interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to hedge fixed rate loans or to otherwise mitigate interest rate risk 
in  the investment portfolio declined by million  or  and decreased to of total assets at the end of from at the end of us treasury and us government agency securities decreased to of the portfolio at the end of from at the end of the decrease was primarily due to maturities of us government agency securities during municipal securities also decreased by in  due to maturities 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations remained fairly constant in the portfolio in compared to loans the company s loans represent the largest portion of earning assets  substantially greater than the securities portfolio or any other asset category  and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when reviewing the company s financial condition 
gross loans represented of total assets at december   as compared to of at december  the ratio of loans to deposits increased to at the end of from at the end of demand for loans remains relatively strong in many areas within the company s markets and competition continues to intensify 
to help ensure that we remain competitive  we make every effort to be flexible and creative in our approach to structuring loans 
the selected financial data table in item reflects the amount of loans outstanding at december st for each year from through  net of deferred fees and origination costs and the allowance for loan losses 
the loan distribution table that follows sets forth the company s gross loans outstanding and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated 
the amounts shown in the table do not reflect any deferred loan fees or deferred origination costs  nor is the allowance for loan loss deducted

the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has remained relatively the same 
the change in the company s loan portfolio in from is primarily due to the acquisition of dvb 
the company does not have any concentrations by industry or group of industries in its loan portfolio  however  of its net loans were secured by real property as of december  and while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into negotiations for the sale of its capital group loan portfolio consisting primarily of factoring type loans 
in contemplation of the sale  million  net of the respective allowance loan loss  was moved from commercial loans into loans held for sale 
the sale of the capital group loan portfolio was completed in  resulting in a gain of million 
the company s commercial loans are made for working capital  financing the purchase of equipment or for other business purposes 
such loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans  with maturities normally ranging from one to five years 
short term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments  with interest payable monthly 
term loans normally provide for floating interest rates  with monthly payments of both principal and interest 
the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in markets where the company has a physical presence  and these markets have become more competitive as business activity has moderated 
the company is an active participant in the small business administration sba and us department of agriculture guaranteed lending programs  and has been approved by the sba as a lender under the preferred lender program 
the company regularly makes sba guaranteed loans 
prior to third quarter of  the guaranteed portion of these loans were sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions 
once it was determined that these loans would be sold  these loans were classified as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or market 
when the guaranteed portion of an sba loan  was sold  the company retained the servicing rights for the sold portion 
as of december    and  million  million and million  respectively  in sba and us department of agriculture loans were serviced by the company for others 
as discussed on page  beginning in the third quarter of  the company changed its strategy regarding its sba loan business by retaining new sba production in lieu of selling the loans 
as of december   real estate mortgage loans of million consist of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by commercial property  and loans secured by first mortgages on family residential properties of million 
of the million in land and construction loans at decemeber   million was construction loans comprised of million residential and million commercial 
the other million of land and construction loans represent residential land loans of million residential and million of commercial land loans 
properties securing the real estate mortgage loans are primarily located in the company s market area 
while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in market areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
real estate values in portions of santa clara county and neighboring san mateo county are among the highest in the country at present but have recently been experiencing a decrease in value from the levels experienced at the beginning of the company s borrowers could be adversely impacted by a downturn in these sectors of the economy  which could reduce the demand for loans and adversely impact the borrowers ability to repay their loans 
the company s real estate term loans consist primarily of loans made based on the borrower s cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment 
the company generally restricts real estate term loans to no more than of the property s appraised value or the purchase price of the property  depending on the type of property and its utilization 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans 
maturities on such loans are generally between five and ten years with amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty five years and a balloon payment due at maturity  however  sba and certain other real estate loans that are easily sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities 
the company s land and construction loans are primarily short term interim loans to finance the construction of commercial and single family residential properties 
the company utilizes underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan 
the company makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles  various types of consumer goods  and other personal purposes 
additionally  the company makes home equity lines of credit available to its clientele 
consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest 
most of the company s consumer loans are secured by the personal property being purchased or  in the instances of home equity loans or lines  real property 
with certain exceptions  state chartered banks are permitted to make extensions of credit to any one borrowing entity up to of the bank s capital and reserves for unsecured loans and up to of the bank s capital and reserves for secured loans 
for hbc  these lending limits were million and million at december   respectively 
loan maturities the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans 
loan maturities over one due in year but one year less than over dollars in thousands or less five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total loans loans with variable interest rates loans with fixed interest rates total loans nonperforming assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to asset quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of asset quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
to help minimize credit quality concerns  we have established a sound approach to credit that includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
the policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan and lease customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as a multi community independent bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes of both the general california and  particularly  primary local markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  and depressed real estate values 
nonperforming assets are comprised of the following loans for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on non accrual when they become days past due unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection  loans restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo 
management s classification of a loan as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan 
at that point  the company stops accruing interest income  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income  and begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s non performing assets at the dates indicated

nonperforming assets increased by million  or  in as compared to while the current level of nonperforming assets is relatively low  we recognize that an increase in the dollar amount of nonaccrual loans is possible in the normal course of business as we expand our lending activities 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the impaired loan balance and value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market 
management conducts a critical evaluation of the loan portfolio monthly 
this evaluation includes periodic loan by loan review for certain loans to evaluate the level of impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools based on an assessment of the following factors past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  size and complexity of the loans  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  bank regulatory examination and independent loan review results  and current economic conditions in the company s marketplace  in particular the state of the technology industry and the real estate market 
this process attempts to assess the risk of loss inherent in the portfolio by segregating loans into two categories for purposes of determining an appropriate level of the allowance loans graded pass through special mention and substandard 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of the loan balance is confirmed 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance and specific allowances 
specific allowances are established for impaired loans 
management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the note agreement 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or on the present value of expected future cash flow 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to pools of outstanding loans 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience  adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the adjustment factors for the formula allowance may include existing general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  in particular the real estate market  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  the technology industry and specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified loans include all loans considered as substandard  doubtful  and loss and may result from problems specific to a borrower s business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower s ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate 
the principal balance of classified loans  which include all loans internally graded as substandard  doubtful  and loss  was million  million  and million  respectively  at december    and at december  and  all of the company s classified loans were graded as substandard 
in adjusting the historical loss factors applied to the respective segments of the loan portfolio  management considered the following factors levels and trends in delinquencies  non accruals  charge offs and recoveries trends in volume and loan terms lending policy or procedural changes experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff national and local economic trends and conditions concentrations of credit there can be no assurance that the adverse impact of any of these conditions on hbc will not be in excess of the current level of estimated losses 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis  we have engaged outside firms to independently assess our methodology and perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the company s credit review consultants  the frb and the dfi also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss allowance is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to weaken 
also  any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty 
the following table summarizes the company s loan loss experience  as well as provisions and charges to the allowance for loan losses and certain pertinent ratios for the periods indicated allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year charge offs commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total recoveries net recoveries charge offs provision for loan losses reclassification of allowance for loan losses reclassification to other liabilities allowance acquired in bank acquisition balance  end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans average loans and total loans exclude loans held for sale the company reclassified million of the allowance allocated to million of commercial asset based loans that were reclassified to loans held for sale as of december  thus  the carrying value of these loans held for sale includes an allowance for loan losses of million 
the company reclassified estimated losses on unused commitments of million to other liabilities as of december  the company s allowance for loan losses increased million in as compared to the allowance for loan losses increased primarily as a result of the diablo valley bank acquistion 
the company had  in recoveries in  which were partially offset by loan charge offs of  the company had a credit provision of  in  compared to a credit provision of  in previously  the company s allowance for loan losses had steadily decreased from through net loans charged off reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously though provisions for loan losses 
net recoveries were million in  compared to net charged offs of million  and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in net loan charge offs in was primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality and a  recovery on a loan charged off in historical net loan charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future 
the company s unallocated allowance was million as of december  and the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amount available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

our net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost deposits such as non interest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words  by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances

as of december   approximately million  or less than  of deposits were from public sources  and approximately million  or  of deposits were from real estate exchange company and title company accounts 
among core deposits categories  noninterest demand deposits increased by million or in furthermore  relatively low cost now accounts increased by million or 
savings and money market accounts increased by million  or  and time deposits increased in absolute dollars but remained flat as a percentage of total deposits 
our increase in savings and money market accounts was primarily the result of the acquisition of diablo valley bank 
while our core deposit accounts increased in number to  at the end of from  at the end of  the average balance per core deposit increased to about  at the end of from  at the end of without the acquisition of diablo valley bank  total deposits would have been relatively flat 
the company faces intensified competition for deposits as core deposits migrate into higher yielding alternatives  including equity markets 
the company obtains deposits from a cross section of the communities it serves 
the company s business is not seasonal in nature 
the company had brokered deposits totaling approximately million  and million at december  and  respectively 
these brokered deposits generally mature within one to three years 
the company is not dependent upon funds from sources outside the united states 
the following table indicates the maturity schedule of the company s time deposits of  or more as of december  deposit maturity distribution dollars in thousands balance of total three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total the company focuses primarily on providing and servicing business deposit accounts that are frequently over  in average balance per account 
as a result  certain types of business clients that the company serves typically carry average deposits in excess of  the account activity for some account types and client types necessitates appropriate liquidity management practices by the company to ensure its ability to fund deposit withdrawals

these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december   as compared to million at december  unused commitments represented of outstanding gross loans at december  and the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted  because there is no certainty that the lines of credit will ever be fully utilized

the following table presents the company s commitments to fund as of december    and december  dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to funds contractual obligations the contractual obligations of the company  summarized by type of obligation and contractual maturity  at december   are as follows less than one to three to after dollars in thousands one year three years five years five years total securities sold under agreement to repurchase notes payable to subsidiary grantor trusts other short term borrowings operating leases time deposits of or more total debt and operating leases in addition to those obligations listed above  in the normal course of business  the company will make cash distributions for the payment of interest on interest bearing deposit accounts and debt obligations  payments for quarterly income tax estimates and contributions to certain employee benefit plans 
liquidity and asset liability management liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations  and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity in such a fashion as to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of on balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the interest margin 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service area and which have  historically  been a stable source of funds 
in addition to core deposits  the company has the ability to raise deposits through various deposit brokers if required for liquidity purposes 
the company s net loan to deposit ratio increased to at the end of from at the end of to meet liquidity needs  the company maintains a portion of its funds in cash deposits at other banks  in federal funds sold and in securities available for sale 
the primary liquidity ratio is composed of net cash  non pledged securities  and other marketable assets  divided by total deposits and short term liabilities minus liabilities secured by investments or other marketable assets 
as of december   the company s primary liquidity ratio was  comprised of million in securities available for sale of maturities of up to five years  less million of securities that were pledged to secure public and certain other deposits as required by law or contract  federal funds sold of million  and million cash and due from banks  as a percentage of total unsecured deposits of  million 
the decrease in the liquidity ratio from was primarily due to the growth of loans in as of december   the company s primary liquidity ratio was  comprised of million in securities available for sale of maturities of up to five years  less million of securities that were pledged to secure public and certain other deposits as required by law and contract  federal funds sold of million and million in cash and due from banks  as a percentage of total unsecured deposits of million

we continue to watch these ratios closely  and expect that these ratios will come back within guidelines 
capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million included million in common stock  million in retained earnings  and million of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per share in the company anticipates paying future dividends within the range of typical peer payout ratios provided  however  that no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a regular basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
our tier capital currently includes common shareholders equity and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities trust preferred securities are counted only up to a maximum of of tier capital  less intangible assets  and the addition of the unrealized net losses after tax adjustments on securities available for sale and accumulated net losses on cash flow hedges  which are carried at fair market value 
our tier capital includes the amount of trust preferred securities not includible in tier capital  and the allowances for loan losses and off balance sheet credit losses

as of december   and  management believes that hbc was considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
mandatory redeemable cumulative trust preferred securities 
to enhance regulatory capital and to provide liquidity  the company  through unconsolidated subsidiary grantor trusts  issued the following mandatory redeemable cumulative trust preferred securities of subsidiary grantor trusts in the first quarter of  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures due on march  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities 
in the third quarter of  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures due on september  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities 
in the third quarter of  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due on july  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities 
in the third quarter of  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due on september  to a subsidiary trust  which in turn issued a similar amount of trust preferred securities 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier i capital 
the subsidiary trusts are not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements and the subordinated debt payable to the subsidiary grantor trusts is recorded as debt of the company to the related trusts 
see footnote the consolidated financial statements 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values  or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits and borrowings  as well as the company s role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and accept the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i a standard gap analysis  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  the net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company uses modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  based on current trends and econometric models or economic conditions stable unchanged from current actual levels 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would increase in the event of a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would decrease in the event of a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates change change market value as a of change change market value as a of in market in market present value of assets in market in market present value of assets dollars in thousands value value mv ratio change bp value value mv ratio change bp change in rates bp bp bp management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the mv methodology does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies general the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
the company adopted statement r on january   and elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method  although the economics of our transactions would be the same 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
our accounting for estimated loan losses is discussed under the heading allowance for loan losses beginning on page loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and i o strips are based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made on management s expectations of future prepayment and discount rates as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under the plan 
we also granted our chief executive officer restricted stock when he joined the company 
additionally  we have outstanding options that were granted under an option plan from which we no longer make grants 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of fasb statement revised  share based payments  which we adopted effective january  we elected to use the modified prospective application in adopting statement r and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
the valuation provisions of statement r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
our results of operations for and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
statement r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest 
our accounting for stock options is disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
management utilizes various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses to determine these fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to the acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as changes in economic or market conditions  indicate that impairment may exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management 
if the fair value of the reporting unit including goodwill is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  a further test is required to measure the amount of impairment 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the goodwill is adjusted to a new cost basis 
for purposes of the goodwill impairment test  fair value techniques based on multiples of earnings or book value are used to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units 
management believes the multiples used in these calculations are consistent with current industry practice for valuing similar types of companies 
intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangible assets arising from the acquisition of diablo valley bank in these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment testing of these assets is performed at the individual asset level 
impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value at the date of the impairment test 
for intangible assets  estimates of expected future cash flows cash inflows less cash outflows that are directly associated with an intangible asset are used to determine the fair value of that asset 
management makes certain estimates and assumptions in determining the expected future cash flows from core deposit and customer relationship intangibles including account attrition  expected lives  discount rates  interest rates  servicing costs and other factors 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact the valuation of these intangible assets 
if an impairment loss exists  the carrying amount of the intangible asset is adjusted to a new cost basis 
the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company does not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosure or market risk called for by item of regulation s k is included as part of item above
