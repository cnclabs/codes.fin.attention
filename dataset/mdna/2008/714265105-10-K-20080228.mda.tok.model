item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein 
overview perot systems corporation  originally incorporated in the state of texas in and reincorporated in the state of delaware on december   is a worldwide provider of information technology commonly referred to as it services and business solutions to a broad range of customers 
we offer our customers integrated solutions designed around their specific business objectives  chosen from a breadth of services  including technology infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
with this approach  our customers benefit from integrated service offerings that help synchronize their strategy  systems  and infrastructure 
as a result  we help our customers achieve their business objectives  whether those objectives are to accelerate growth  streamline operations  or enhance customer service capabilities 
our services our customers may contract with us for any one or more of the following categories of services infrastructure services applications services business process services consulting services infrastructure services infrastructure services are typically performed under multi year contracts in which we assume operational responsibility for various aspects of our customers businesses  including data center and systems management  web hosting and internet access  desktop solutions  messaging services  program management  hardware maintenance and monitoring  network management  including vpn services  service desk capabilities  physical security  network security  risk management  and virtualization the management of leveraged computing environments 
we typically hire a significant portion of the customer s staff that supported these functions prior to the transition of services 
we then apply our expertise and operating methodologies and utilize technology to increase the efficiency of the operations  which usually results in increased operational quality at a lower cost 
applications services applications services include services such as application development and maintenance  including the development and maintenance of custom and packaged application software for customers  and application systems migration and testing  which includes the migration of applications from legacy environments to current technologies  as well as performing quality assurance functions on custom applications 
we also provide other applications services such as application assessment and evaluation  hardware and architecture consulting  systems integration  and web based services 
business process services business process services include services such as product engineering  claims processing  life insurance policy administration  call center management  payment and settlement management  security  and services to improve the collection of receivables 
in addition  business process services include engineering support and other technical and administrative services that we provide to the us federal government 

table of contents consulting services consulting services include strategy consulting  enterprise consulting  technology consulting  and research 
the consulting services provided to customers within our industry solutions and government services segments typically consist of customized  industry specific business solutions provided by associates with industry expertise 
the consulting services provided within the consulting and application solutions segment primarily relate to the implementation of prepackaged software applications 
consulting services are typically viewed as discretionary services by our customers  with the level of business activity depending on many factors  including economic conditions and specific customer needs 
our contracts our contracts include services priced using a wide variety of pricing mechanisms 
in determining how to price our services  we consider the delivery  credit and pricing risk of a services agreement 
for the year ended december  approximately of our revenue was from fixed price contracts where our customers pay us a set amount for contracted services 
for some of these fixed price contracts  the price will be set so that the customer realizes immediate savings in relation to their current expense for the services we will be performing 
on contracts of this nature  our profitability generally increases over the term of the contract as we become more efficient 
the time that it takes for us to realize these efficiencies can range from a few months to a few years  depending on the complexity of the services 
approximately of our revenue was from time and materials contracts where our billings are based on measurements such as hours  days or months and an agreed upon rate 
in some cases  the rate the customer pays for a unit of time can vary over the term of a contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
approximately of our revenue was from cost plus contracts where our billings are based in part on the amount of expense we incur in providing services to a customer 
approximately of our revenue was from per unit pricing where we bill our customers based on the volumes of units provided at the unit rate specified 
in some contracts  the per unit prices may vary over the term of the contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
we also utilize other pricing mechanisms  including license fees and risk reward relationships where we participate in the benefit associated with delivering a certain outcome 
revenue from these other pricing mechanisms totaled less than of our revenue 
depending on a customer s business requirements and the pricing structure of the contract  the amount of profit generated from a contract can vary significantly during a contract s term 
with fixed or unit priced contracts  or when an upfront payment is made to purchase assets or as a sales incentive  an outsourcing services contract will typically produce less profit at the beginning of the contract with significantly more profit being generated as efficiencies are realized later in the term 
with a cost plus contract  the amount of profit generated tends to be relatively consistent over the term of the contract 
our lines of business we offer our services under three primary lines of business industry solutions  government services  and consulting and applications solutions 
we consider these three lines of business to be reportable segments and include financial information and disclosures about these reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements 
you can find this financial information in note  segment and certain geographic data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
we routinely evaluate the historical performance of and growth prospects for various areas of our business  including our lines of business  delivery groups  and service offerings 
based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of varying factors  we may increase or decrease the 
table of contents amount of ongoing investment in each of these business areas  make acquisitions that strengthen our market position  or divest  exit  or downsize aspects of a business area 
results of operations overview of our financial results for our financial results are affected by a number of factors  including broad economic conditions  the amount and type of technology spending by our customers  and the business strategies and financial condition of our customers and the industries we serve  which could result in increases or decreases in the amount of services that we provide to our customers and the pricing of such services 
our ability to identify and effectively respond to these factors is important to our future financial growth 
we evaluate our consolidated performance on the basis of several performance indicators 
the four key performance indicators we use are revenue growth  earnings growth  free cash flow  and the value of contracts signed 
we compare these key performance indicators to both annual target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
we establish the targets for these key performance indicators primarily on an annual basis  but we may revise them during the year 
we assess our performance using these key indicators on a quarterly and annual basis 
certain of these performance indicators are extracted from consolidated financial information and are not required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are considered non gaap financial measures as defined by sec rules 
specifically  we refer to free cash flow 
as required by sec rules  we provide a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure and an explanation why we believe that the presentation of the non gaap financial measure provides useful information to investors 
non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
termination of a services agreement in the fourth quarter of  we received notice from a client that it would end the current services agreement 
as a result  we realized contract termination related revenue and gross profit of approximately million and million  respectively  including a contractually obligated termination fee of million and recognition of revenue and costs that were previously deferred of million and million  respectively 
prior to this termination  this client was one of our ten largest clients 
effect of the end of our infrastructure outsourcing contract with ubs ubs ag was our largest customer through december  our infrastructure outsourcing agreement with ubs ended on january  during  our ubs relationship generated million  or  of our revenue  which included million of revenue and million of gross profit from our infrastructure outsourcing contract with ubs that ended on january  we continue to provide applications services to ubs  which are provided outside the scope of the infrastructure outsourcing contract that ended on january  revenue growth revenue growth is a measure of the growth we generate through sales of services to new customers  retention of existing contracts  acquisitions  and discretionary services from existing customers 
revenue for grew by as compared to as discussed in more detail below  this revenue growth came primarily from the following revenue from companies acquired in the first and third quarter of and revenue from a company acquired in the first quarter of for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in an increase in revenue from the expansion of base services and discretionary technology investments by our existing long term customers 

table of contents revenue from new contracts signed during and from new contracts signed in for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in contract termination related revenue in the fourth quarter of see termination of a services agreement above 
partially offsetting these increases in revenue was the loss of revenue from our infrastructure outsourcing contract with ubs that ended on january  earnings growth we measure earnings growth using diluted earnings per share  which is a measure of our effectiveness in delivering profitable growth 
diluted earnings per share for increased to per share from per share for this increase came primarily from additional gross profit on a healthcare customer of million  or approximately per diluted share  of which million is related to the termination of a services agreement  as discussed above in termination of a services agreement 
during the third quarter of  we modified an existing contract that included both construction services and non construction services 
the construction services related to a software development and implementation project  which was modified to eliminate the fixed price development and implementation deliverables in the original contract 
following the contract modification in september  we impaired million of the deferred costs  or approximately per diluted share  and recorded this charge to direct cost of services in the consolidated income statements 
a reduction in incentive compensation of million  or approximately per diluted share  which partially reduced the impact on earnings of the expiration of the outsourcing agreement with ubs 
we do not expect this reduced level of incentive compensation to continue in future periods 
additional operating income of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share  due to the acquisition of qss group  inc qss  in the first quarter of during the years ended december  and  we incurred losses of million and million  respectively  on an infrastructure services contract with a commercial solutions customer 
the decrease in losses in from this contract resulted in an increase in gross profit of million  or approximately per diluted share 
during the third quarter of  we recorded expense of million  or approximately per diluted share  related to cost reduction activities 
the expense is attributable to the consolidation and elimination of facilities and products  the combination of units  and severance expense 
these improvements to our earnings were partially offset by gross profits from our infrastructure outsourcing contract with ubs decreased by million in as compared to as a result of the end of the ubs infrastructure outsourcing contract on january  the loss from this contract resulted in a decrease in earnings of approximately per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded expense of million  or approximately per diluted share  related to cost reduction activities implemented in the fourth quarter of an increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december   to as compared to an effective tax rate for the year ended december   of  resulted in a decrease of approximately 
per diluted share on full year net income  which includes 
related to the million increase in income before taxes from to a change in our net interest income and expense to million of net interest expense for the year ended december   from million net interest income for the year ended december   resulted in a decrease in earnings of million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents free cash flow we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  equipment and purchased software  as stated in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we use free cash flow as a measure of our ability to generate cash for both our short term and long term operating and business expansion needs 
we believe this measure provides important supplemental information to investors and allows them to assess our ability to meet our working capital requirements and business expansion needs 
free cash flow for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december  free cash flow  which is a non gaap measure  can be reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as follows in millions year ended december net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow see liquidity and capital resources below for additional discussion of net cash provided by operations under operating activities and additional discussion of our purchases of property  equipment and software under investing activities 
tcv of contracts signed the amount of total contract value commonly referred to as tcv that we sell during a twelve month period is a measure of our success in capturing new business in the various outsourcing and consulting markets in which we provide services and includes contracts with new customers and contracts for new services with existing customers 
we measure tcv as our estimate of the total expected revenue from contracts that are expected to generate revenue in excess of a defined amount during a contract term that exceeds a defined length of time 
various factors may impact the timing of the signing of contracts with customers  including the complexity of the contract  competitive pressures  and customer demands 
as a result  we generally measure our success in this area over a twelve month period because of the significant variations that typically occur in the amount of tcv signed during each quarterly period 
during the twelve month period ended december   the amount of tcv signed was billion  as compared to billion for the twelve month period ended december  included in the billion of tcv signed for the twelve month period ending december   was billion relating to the signing of the services agreement that was terminated in october  as discussed in more detail above under termination of a services agreement 
additional measurements each of our three primary lines of business has distinct economic factors  business trends  and risks that could affect our results of operations 
as a result  in addition to the four metrics discussed above that we use to measure our consolidated financial performance  we use similar metrics for each of these lines of business and for certain industry groups and operating units within these lines of business

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is important to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements

the fees under these arrangements are generally based on the level of effort incurred in delivering the services  including cost plus and time and materials fee arrangements  on a contracted fixed price for contracted services  or on a contracted per unit price for each unit of service delivered 
these services include infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
within these four categories of services  our contracts include non construction service deliverables  including infrastructure services and business process services  and construction service deliverables  such as application development and implementation services 
accounting for revenue in single deliverable arrangements revenue for non construction service deliverables is recognized as the services are delivered in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which provides that revenue should be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under our policy  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when a final understanding between us and our customer exists as to the specific nature and terms of the services that we are going to provide  as documented in the form of a signed agreement between us and the customer 
revenue for non construction services priced under fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the longer of the term of the contract or the expected service period  regardless of the amounts that can be billed in each period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or our obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
if we are to provide a similar level of non construction services each period during the term of a contract  we would recognize the revenue on a straight line basis since our obligations are being fulfilled in a straight line pattern 
if our obligations are being fulfilled in a pattern that is not consistent over the term of a contract  then we would recognize revenue consistent with the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period 
in determining the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period  we consider the nature of the deliverables we are providing to the customer and whether the volumes of those deliverables are easily measured  such as when we provide a contractual number of full time equivalent associate resources 
if the amount of our obligations fulfilled in each period is not easily distinguished by reference to the volumes of services provided  then we would recognize revenue on a straight line basis 
revenue for construction services that do not include a license to one of our software products is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  sop requires the use of the 
table of contents percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and profit as our work progresses  and we primarily use hours incurred to date to measure our progress toward completion 
this method relies on estimates of total expected hours to complete the construction service  which are compared to hours incurred to date  to arrive at an estimate of how much revenue and profit has been earned to date 
although we primarily measure our progress toward completion using hours incurred to date  we may measure our progress toward completion using costs incurred to date if the construction services involve a significant amount of non labor costs 
because these estimates may require significant judgment  depending on the complexity and length of the construction services  the amount of revenue and profits that have been recognized to date are subject to revisions 
if we do not accurately estimate the amount of hours or costs required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then revenue and profits may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revenue for the sale of a license from our software products or the sale of services relating to a software license is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
in general  sop addresses the separation and the timing of revenue recognition for software and software related services  such as implementation and maintenance services 
sop also requires the application of the percentage of completion method as described in sop for those software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of the software 
as a result  the accounting for revenue related to software arrangements includes many of the estimates and significant judgments discussed above 
revenue for services priced under time and materials contracts and unit priced contracts is recognized as the services are provided at the contractual unit price 
accounting for revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements for those arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we first determine whether each service  or deliverable  meets the separation criteria of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in general  a deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the remaining deliverables in the arrangement 
each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method for each unit of accounting as described previously based on the nature of the arrangement and the services included in each unit of accounting 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria of eitf are combined into one unit of accounting  and the most appropriate revenue recognition method is applied 
in arrangements for both non construction and construction services  we may bill the customer prior to performing services  which would require us to record deferred revenue 
in other arrangements  we may perform services prior to billing the customer  which could require us to record unbilled receivables or to defer the costs associated with either the non construction or construction services  depending on the terms of the arrangement and the application of the revenue separation criteria of eitf in certain arrangements we may pay consideration to the customer at the beginning of a contract as an incentive  which is most commonly in the form of cash 
this consideration is recorded in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the related contract 
as a result of our adoption of eitf in  we recognized revenue of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  that was recognized prior to under our accounting for revenue prior to the adoption of eitf and was also included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which we recorded in the first quarter of 
table of contents contract costs costs to deliver services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of setup costs and the cost of certain construction and non construction services for which the related revenue must be deferred under eitf or other accounting literature 
we defer and subsequently amortize certain setup costs related to activities that enable us to provide the contracted services to customers 
deferred contract setup costs may include costs incurred during the setup phase of a customer arrangement relating to data center migration  implementation of certain operational processes  employee transition  and relocation of key personnel 
we amortize deferred contract setup costs on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related contract 
useful lives range from three years up to a maximum of the term of the related customer contract 
for a construction service in a single deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the total amount that can be billed under the terms of the arrangement  then a loss would generally be recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable 
for a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the amount of revenue that is allocated to the separate construction service unit of accounting based on the relative fair value allocation  limited to the amount that is not contingent  then the actual costs incurred to complete the construction service in excess of the allocated fair value would be deferred  up to the amount of the relative fair value  and amortized over the remaining term of the contract 
a loss would generally be recorded on a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement if the total costs to complete the service exceed the relative fair value of the service 
deferred contract costs are evaluated for realizability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable 
our evaluation is based on the amount of non refundable deferred revenue that is related to the deferred contract costs and our projection of the remaining gross profits from the related customer contract 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the deferred contract costs is greater than the amount of non refundable deferred revenue and the remaining net gross profits from the customer contract  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal the amount of non refundable deferred revenue and remaining gross profits 
year end bonus plan one of our compensation methods is to pay to certain associates a year end bonus  which is based on associate and team performance  our financial results  and management s discretion 
the amount of bonus expense that we record each quarter is based on several factors  including our financial performance for that quarter  our latest expectations for full year results  and management s estimate of the amount of bonus to be paid at the end of the year 
as a result  the amount of bonus expense that we record in each quarter can vary significantly 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is reasonably possible but not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  then we may disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
goodwill and other intangibles we allocate the cost of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  and any cost of the acquired companies not allocated to assets acquired or liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is evaluated at least annually for 
table of contents impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from twelve months to seven years 
the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth at the date of acquisition 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the third quarter or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
the impairment test is conducted for each reporting unit in which goodwill is recorded by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily by computing the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  goodwill may be impaired 
if this occurs  the fair value of the reporting unit is then allocated to its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit  we would recognize an impairment loss to write down the goodwill to fair value 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
income tax expense consists of our current and deferred provisions for us and foreign income taxes 
we do not provide for us income tax on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 
except for amounts repatriated in pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the act  we intend to either permanently invest our non us earnings or remit such earnings in a tax free manner 
the act created a temporary incentive through december   for us companies to repatriate income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for qualifying foreign dividends 
the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings as calculated for income tax purposes of our non us subsidiaries was approximately million at december   and million at december  such earnings include pre acquisition earnings of non us entities acquired through stock purchases and are intended to be invested outside of the us indefinitely 
the ultimate tax liability related to repatriation of our undistributed earnings is dependent upon future tax planning opportunities and is not estimable at the present time 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the recognition  measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions and on the accounting for related interest and penalties 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the effect of the adoption of fin is detailed in note income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates  and the application of complex tax regulations 
as a global company  we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate  including estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are subject to income tax audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities and we are currently under audit by the internal revenue 
table of contents service and the indian and united kingdom taxing authorities 
we fully cooperate with all audits  but we defend our positions vigorously 
although we believe that we have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions  the actual liability resulting from examinations by tax authorities could differ substantially from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result in additional income tax expense 
changes to our recorded income tax liabilities resulting from the resolution of tax matters are reflected in income tax expense in the period of resolution 
other factors may cause us to revise our estimates of income tax liabilities including the expiration of statutes of limitations  changes in tax regulations  and tax rulings 
changes in estimates of income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in our change in estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
financial instruments the carrying amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term and long term debt approximate their respective fair values 
fair values are based primarily on current prices for those or similar instruments 
derivative financial instruments as part of our risk management strategy  we enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain financial risks related to foreign currencies and interest rates 
we have a risk management policy outlining the conditions under which we can enter into derivative financial instrument transactions 
to date  our use of derivative financial instruments has been limited to interest rate swaps  that hedge our exposure to floating rates on certain portions of our debt  and forward contracts and zero cost collars that hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the third quarter of  we began designating certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities 
as such  the changes in the fair value of our derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet and are reclassified to the same consolidated income statement category as the hedged item in the period in which the hedged transactions occur 
our policy requires us to document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for entering into economic hedges 
we also assess  at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
in accordance with fas  the derivative s change in fair value will be deferred in other comprehensive income until the period in which the hedged transaction occurs 
if the change in fair value creates any ineffectiveness  which represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in the cash flow of the forecasted transaction  the ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in earnings 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative financial instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure being hedged  the derivative financial instrument matures  or is sold  terminated or exercised  or we determine that designating the derivative financial instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate 
when hedge accounting is discontinued  and the derivative financial instrument remains outstanding  the deferred gains or losses on the cash flow hedge will remain in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
any further changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument will be recognized in current period earnings 
for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or for which we have not elected to apply hedge accounting  the changes in fair values are recognized in other income  net 

table of contents short term investments our short term investments consist of variable rate demand notes vrdn 
our vrdn investments are tax exempt instruments of high credit quality 
the primary objectives of vrdn investments are preservation of invested funds  liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and yield 
vrdn securities have variable interest rates that reset at regular intervals of one  seven   or days 
although vrdn securities are issued and rated as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term instruments 
we classify these short term investments as available for sale in accordance with fas  accounting for certain instruments in debt and equity securities 
the cost of our vrdns approximates fair value 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist of cash equivalents  short term investments  and accounts receivable 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of short term money market deposits  which are deposited with reputable financial institutions 
our short term investments consist of vrdns  which are tax exempt instruments of high credit quality 
we believe the risk of loss associated with both our cash equivalents and short term investments to be remote 
we have accounts receivable from customers engaged in various industries including banking  insurance  healthcare  manufacturing  telecommunications  travel and energy  as well as government customers in defense and other governmental agencies  and our accounts receivable are not concentrated in any specific geographic region 
these specific industries may be affected by economic factors  which may impact accounts receivable 
generally  we do not require collateral from our customers 
we do not believe that any single customer  industry or geographic area represents significant credit risk 
no customer accounted for or more of our total accounts receivable including accounts receivable recorded in both accounts receivable  net  and long term accrued revenue at december  or at december  stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method 
prior to the adoption of fas r and as permitted by fas and fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we elected to follow apb and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options and implemented the disclosure only provisions of fas and fas under apb  stock compensation expense was recorded when the exercise price of employee stock options was less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
for a further discussion of the impact of fas r on the results of our financial statements  see note  stock options and stock based compensation 
to account for the tax effects of stock based compensation  fas r requires a calculation to establish the beginning pool of excess tax benefits  or the additional paid in capital apic pool  available to absorb any tax deficiencies recognized after the adoption of fas r 
tax deficiencies arise when the actual tax benefit from the tax deduction for share based compensation at the statutory tax rate is less than the related deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements 
we have elected the alternative transition method for calculating the apic pool as described in fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
significant accounting standards to be adopted fasb statement no r in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
fas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early

in september  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
fas will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  delayed application is permitted for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in an entity s financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our results of operations and financial position 
fasb statement no 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under fas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees  issued debt and other eligible financial instruments 
fas is effective for years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
we generally manage these transactions by ensuring that costs to service these contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
by matching revenue and costs to the same currency  we have been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these transactions when necessary 
we do not foresee changing our foreign currency exposure management strategy 
during   or million  of our revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
in our opinion  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase of in the interest rate related to our borrowing of million under our credit facility would increase our net expense by approximately  for the year ended december
