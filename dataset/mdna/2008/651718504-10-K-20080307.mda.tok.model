item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
overview we are a diversified oil and gas industry supplier  and we currently have two reportable segments fluids systems and engineering  and mats and integrated services 
we provide these products and services principally to the e p industry in the us gulf coast  west texas  us mid continent  us rocky mountains  canada  mexico  brazil and areas of europe and north africa surrounding the mediterranean sea 
further  we are expanding our presence outside the e p sector through our mats and integrated services  where we are marketing to utilities  municipalities  and government sectors 
following a comprehensive review of all of our businesses in the first quarter of  we decided to explore strategic alternatives with regards to our environmental services business  which was historically reported as a third reportable segment 
subsequently  we initiated a sale process for this business and entered into an agreement in october to sell the us environmental services business for million in cash and potentially an additional million which may be paid to us under a five year earn out provision 
this sale is expected to close during the second quarter of  subject to customary closing requirements 
in conjunction with this process  we decided to exit certain environmental services activities within the canadian market during the third quarter of  which resulted in million of charges during the third and fourth quarter of  including million for the impairment of goodwill 
as a result of these developments  all assets  liabilities and results of operations of our us and canadian environmental services business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the decision to sell the environmental services business is part of our strategic plan to focus our attention and capital on our fluids systems and engineering and mats and integrated services businesses 
in august  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of sem construction company sem  for cash consideration of million 
sem is a full service well site construction company engaged in construction  reclamation  maintenance  and general rig work for the oil and gas industry at drilling locations throughout western colorado and is reported within the mats and integrated services segment 
also during august  we completed the sale of a sawmill facility for million  which was historically reported within the mats and integrated services segment 
as a result of the sales agreement for this transaction  we recorded an impairment loss on the sale of discontinued operations of million million after tax in the second quarter of and reclassified all assets  liabilities and results of operations to discontinued operations  for all periods presented 
in october  we received final court approval of the previously announced settlement of our pending derivative and class action litigation 
under the terms of the settlement  we paid million  and our directors and officers liability insurance carrier paid million 
the settlement resolves all pending shareholder class and derivative litigation against us  our former and current directors  and our former officers 
as part of the settlement  however  we preserved certain claims against our former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer for matters arising from the potential invoicing irregularities at soloco texas  lp and the backdating of stock options 
in december  we entered into a new five year million credit facility  including a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
borrowings under this facility were used to repay the outstanding balances and terminate our million term credit facility and million revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the termination of the former credit facilities  we recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of to write off previously capitalized debt issuance costs 

table of contents hurricane impact our fluids systems and engineering operations along the us gulf coast were severely affected by hurricanes katrina and rita in and early during  we recorded recoveries related to business interruption coverage related to the hurricanes of million as reductions to cost of revenues 
results of operations our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
the drilling activity levels depend on oil and gas commodity pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average rig count data for the last three years ended december is as follows year ended december  vs vs count count in thousands us rig count canadian rig count total source baker hughes incorporated summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of intersegment transfers year ended december  vs vs in thousands segment revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services total segment revenues segment operating income fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services total segment operating income general and administrative expenses operating income segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services total segment operating margin includes million of insurance recoveries as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in the year ended december  
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues by region for this segment were as follows for the years ended december  and year ended december  vs in thousands north america mediterranean and south america total drilling fluid and engineering revenues completion fluids and services industrial materials total north american drilling fluid and engineering revenues increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  overall north american rig activity was relatively unchanged during this period  as a increase in the us rig count was partially offset by a decrease in the canadian rig count 
the average number of north american rigs serviced by our business decreased by during this time 
this decrease in rigs serviced is primarily related to the weak canadian market as well as an industry shift toward drilling shallower conventional oil wells in the us market as compared to the deeper wells that we typically service 
the decrease in number of rigs serviced by this segment is more than offset by a increase in our average revenue per rig  resulting from our focused efforts to concentrate on deeper and more complex wells  including the off shore gulf coast markets 
mediterranean and south america revenues increased in the year ended december  over levels  representing of total segment revenues in  compared to in this increase was driven by increased rig activity and continued penetration into the north african and romanian markets 
revenues in our completion fluids and industrial materials businesses increased million for the year ended december   or as compared to as increases in us sales activity was partially offset by declines in industrial materials sales into the canadian market 
in  we anticipate that rig activity in the north american markets will remain relatively flat to  while the mediterranean and south american markets will continue to remain robust  although at a lower rate of growth than experienced in recent years 
operating income operating income for this segment decreased million for the year ended december  on a million increase in revenues  resulting in a decline in operating margin from to 
north american operating profit decreased million on a million increase in revenues  primarily due to million of non recurring insurance recoveries from hurricanes katrina and rita  which increased operating profits in in addition  operating profits were negatively impacted by higher operating costs  including significantly higher barite transportation costs  as well as the continued operating costs in the canadian business which has remained relatively flat  despite the decline in sales volumes 
the mediterranean region operating income increased million on a million increase in revenues from to  while the south american operation generated a million increase in operating losses  due to costs associated with the start up of operations

mats and integrated services revenues total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total us oilfield mat rental revenues increased by million in  compared to  primarily due to higher drilling activity in the inland gulf coast markets 
this increase was partially offset by lower revenues from non oilfield mat rentals  a premium margin market composed principally of seasonal utility and infrastructure construction markets  which decreased million 
canadian revenues  primarily related to the sales of wooden mats  increased million over  due to increased demand during the first half of year for our wooden mats in the western canada market and a large one time sale in the first quarter of this increase in sales was partially offset by lower composite mats sales activity 
operating income segment operating income improved million in on an million increase in revenues  compared to this represents an incremental operating margin of

the initial notional amount of the swap agreements totals million  reducing by million each december  matching the required principal repayments under the term loan 
as a result of the swap agreements  we will pay a fixed rate of plus the applicable libor margin  which was basis points at december   over the term of the loan 
ava  spa  our european fluids systems and engineering subsidiary ava maintains its own credit arrangements consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  which are renewed on an annual basis 
advances under these short term credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of ava s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
the weighted average interest rate under these arrangements 
table of contents was at december  as of december   ava had a total of million outstanding under these facilities  including million reported in long term debt

the specific timing of settlement for certain long term obligations  including million of liabilities recorded in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 can not be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts and disclosures reported 
estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include the following allowances for product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for inventory obsolescence  reserves for self insured retentions under insurance programs  fair values used for goodwill impairment testing  undiscounted cash flows used for impairment testing of long lived assets and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
table of contents that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
since amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance could be material 
allowance for sales returns we maintain reserves for estimated customer returns of unused materials in our fluids systems and engineering segment 
the reserves are established based upon historical customer return levels and estimated gross profit levels attributable to product sales 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on fair value of the inventory using factors such as our historical usage of inventory on hand  future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
impairments of long lived assets we perform annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of november  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we determine impairment of goodwill by comparing the carrying amounts of our reporting units with fair values  which we estimate using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
we identify our reporting units based on our analysis of several factors  including our operating segment structure  evaluation of the economic characteristics of our geographic regions within each of our operating segments  and the extent to which our business units share assets and other resources 
we review property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flows 
in estimating expected cash flows  we use a probability weighted approach 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which is estimated based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable  any impairment is calculated and recorded as an impairment loss 
insurance we maintain reserves for estimated future payments associated with our self insured employee healthcare programs  as well as the self insured retention exposures under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
our reserves are determined based on historical cost experience under these programs  
table of contents including estimated development of known claims under these programs and estimated incurred but not reported claims 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets of million at december  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million for state nols as well as various tax carryforwards 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period this determination was made 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
fin became effective for us in as a result of the january  implementation of fin  we performed a comprehensive review of possible uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by fin as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a liability of million resulting in a corresponding increase to the retained deficit balance at january  new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements

we will apply sfas r prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  that sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had total debt outstanding of million  all of which is subject to variable rate terms 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying libor interest rate on our borrowings under our term loan 
the initial notional amount of the swap agreements totals million  reducing by million each december  matching the required principal repayments under the term loan 
as a result of the swap agreements  we will pay a fixed rate of plus the applicable libor margin  which was basis points at december   over the term of the loan 
the remaining million of debt outstanding at december  bears interest at a floating rate 
at december   the weighted average interest rate under our floating rate debt was approximately 
a basis point increase in market interest rates during would cause our annual interest expense to increase approximately million  net of taxes  resulting in a per diluted share reduction in annual earnings 
as of december   our ava operation had a swap arrangement in which ava received a floating rate from a bank and paid a rate which varied based on inflation 
under the terms of the swap  ava receives an annual payment from the bank based on a euro notional amount of million times the euribor rate in effect as of the end of the determination period  and pays an annual amount to the bank based on the notional amount times a rate which varies according to both the euribor rate and the published inflation rate for the euro area 
this arrangement requires annual settlements and matures in february at december   the fair value of this arrangement represents a liability of approximately million 
in february  we reached an agreement with the bank to terminate this agreement 
the total cost of the termination settlement is not expected to exceed the liability recorded at december  foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in areas surrounding the mediterranean sea  canada and brazil 
we have foreign currency exchange risks associated with these operations  which are conducted principally in the foreign currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate which include european euros  canadian dollars and brazilian reals 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments
