our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of such factors  including those set forth in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form k 
overview we provide vertical search services to trade publishers 
our technology and services help publishers to build a loyal online community and increase their internet advertising revenues 
with the use of our vertical search services  our customers can create search engines customized to meet the specialized information needs of their audience by combining publisher proprietary content with an authoritative subset of the web 
on march   we agreed to sell the assets of our enterprise search business for million in cash to fast 
this transaction closed on august  with fast assuming certain obligations of the business and retaining certain employees serving its enterprise search customers 
accordingly  revenues and expenses and cash flows related to the enterprise search business have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows 
the assets and liabilities of the enterprise search business are reported as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see further discussion in note  discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our principal source of revenue is provided through sales of our vertical search services to the websites of publishers of trade business and specialist publications 
our vertical search technology is a hosted application sold as a service to the publishers 
we generate our revenues by receiving a percentage of publishers advertising revenues earned by the search sites and by charging minimum fees for our vertical search and advertising services 
many of our contracts with publishers contain monthly minimum fees that we are entitled to receive until website advertising revenue generated by the publishers search sites exceeds these monthly minimum amounts 
we can also generate revenues from hosting publisher web sites and from providing technical staff training 
we offer professional services to customize publisher web sites and optimize search engines  as well as web site monetization consulting 
we use an at t facility to host our vertical search offering 
this facility  located in dallas  tx  is operated under a master hosting arrangement that expires in july we also maintained a hosting facility in san diego  ca  which was vacated on january  in an effort to appropriately scale our hosting infrastructure 
we believe that our hosting center environment has sufficient equipment capacity and redundancy to host vertical search websites for trade publications each with an average community of  users at competitive search performance levels  which is enough capacity to meet our current needs 
trends as of january   a total of convera supported websites were in production and a total of vertical search websites were in development awaiting launch 
this represents a steady increase from november when the first site was launched into production 
in fiscal year  our strategy is to continue to target the top bb publishers in the united states and united kingdom  which have an estimated  plus relevant magazine titles that could be converted to search based websites 
for both newly signed and current customers  our expectation is that the publishers will launch vertical search based websites in a much shorter period of time than was typical in fiscal due to the release of version of our publisher control panel 
the publisher control panel shortens the time required to launch a site from six months to less than a month  which should translate into our receiving advertising based revenues sooner 
the majority of the revenues earned for fiscal year represented contract minimum amounts for hosted services 
we expect continued growth in hosted service fee revenues  as our new and renewal contracts with publishers will typically contain a minimum service fee for our vertical search services 
we expect advertising share based revenue growth as new and existing websites build traffic and subsequently increase their advertising sales 
we also have launched the convera ad service cas as an integral part of our vertical search services  which should result in additional advertising share revenues for us 
cas will enable publishers to better manage the monetization of their professional communities search experiences and increase the effectiveness of search based revenues on their websites 
cas can also connect the publisher websites directly with the providers of advertising inventory  increasing the opportunities for the websites to grow their advertising revenues 

table of contents as a result of restructuring actions taken throughout fiscal  we have reduced our quarterly expense run rate and expect the full impact of these actions to become apparent in the first quarter of fiscal year the combined reduction in expenses and increase in revenues should result in a decrease in the net loss from continuing operations in fiscal critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we do not have any material ownership interest in any entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base those estimates on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from our vertical search service offering can consist of hosted services  professional services and advertising revenue shares 
our vertical search services revenues are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition 
we evaluate vertical search services arrangements that have multiple deliverables  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf abstract issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
judgment is required in interpreting a revenue contract to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 
multiple deliverable arrangements that contain elements that do not qualify as separate units of accounting are recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement 
our vertical search service contracts typically include advertising share revenue agreements  and may include monthly contract minimum service fees 
monthly contract minimums and other hosting fees or set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
advertising share revenues are recognized when earned under the provisions of the hosting agreement 
revenue from training and professional services is recognized when the services are performed 
in addition  in all cases  to recognize revenue we need to assess whether the price is fixed and determinable  whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  whether the service has been delivered and whether collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
provision for doubtful accounts a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances and determining whether a provision for doubtful accounts is warranted 
our determination is based on an analysis of our historical collection experience and our portfolio of customers taking into consideration the general economic environment as well as the industry in which we operate 
to the extent we do not recognize deterioration in our customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent we do not accurately estimate our customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
our vertical search services have yet to achieve significant revenues and consequently as of january  we do not maintain a provision for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
as revenues increase  we will periodically review whether a provision is required 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate all of our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
this review requires significant judgments both in assessing events and circumstances as well as estimating future cash flows 
should events indicate that any of our assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and the impairment will be recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
the determination of fair value is inherently an estimate and requires significant judgment 
see note  impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k for information about the impairment charges we have taken 

table of contents research and product development costs we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
our software development costs are included in research and product development and are expensed as incurred 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which our software development projects enter the stage at which costs should be capitalized  determining the estimated useful lives over which the capitalized costs should be amortized and assessing the recoverability of the capitalized software development costs 
previously  we capitalized software development costs related to our excalibur web hosting product beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we continued to do so until such time as commercial availability was determined 
amortization of the previously capitalized software development costs began in the third quarter of fiscal year and was to continue over a twenty four month period 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge for the unamortized balance of the capitalized research and development costs 
for more information regarding the impairment determination  see note  impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
accounting for income taxes we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method of sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax laws and tax rates in each jurisdiction where we operate  and applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  the amounts of any future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
we calculate estimated income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for both book and tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of projected future taxable income 
if the estimates and related assumptions change in the future we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in a benefit or a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
as of january   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on february  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transitions 
we previously recognized income tax positions based on management s estimate of whether it was reasonably possible that a liability had been incurred for unrecognized tax benefits by applying sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the provisions of fin became effective for the company on february  significant judgment is required in evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and determining the valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets 
we have concluded that there are no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation on february   we adopted the provisions of and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  that addresses the accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires that stock based compensation be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we use the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas r 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in the application of sfas r  in particular with regards to forfeiture rates  volatility and expected life assumptions 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change  stock based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is principally confined to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse effects of differing tax structures 
international revenues from ctil  our foreign sales subsidiary located in the united kingdom  were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year international sales are made predominantly from our foreign subsidiary and are typically denominated in british pounds  euros or us dollars 
as of january   approximately of total consolidated accounts receivable was denominated in british pounds 
the majority of these receivables are due within days of the end of fiscal year  and all receivables are due within one year 
additionally  we are exposed to potential foreign currency gains or losses resulting from intercompany accounts that are not of a long term nature 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of ctil are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
as of january   less than one percent of our cash and cash equivalents were denominated in british pounds  euros and canadian dollars  respectively 
cash equivalents consist of funds deposited in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less 
we also have certificates of deposit of  and  included in other assets which are pledged to collateralize letters of credit required for leased facilities 
given the relatively short maturity periods of these cash equivalents  the cost of these investments approximates their fair values and our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited
