item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
in  we recorded a charge of approximately million to equity income resulting from the impact of our proportionate share of an impairment charge recorded by cce  and impairment charges of approximately million primarily related to trademarks for beverages sold in the philippines and indonesia  and in  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million primarily related to our operations and investments in the philippines 
if market conditions in certain territories in europe or asia in which our company has significant investments in bottling operations deteriorate  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
in addition  unexpected declines in our operating results and structural changes in these and other markets may also result in impairment charges 
additional impairment charges would reduce our reported earnings for the periods in which they are recorded 
if we do not successfully manage our company owned bottling operations  our results could suffer 
while we primarily manufacture  market and sell concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners  from time to time we do acquire or take control of bottling operations and have increasingly done so in recent years 
as of december   the net operating revenues generated by company owned and controlled bottling operations which are included in the bottling investments operating segment represented approximately percent of our company s consolidated net operating revenues 
often  though not always  these acquired bottling operations are in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance 
acquisitions and consolidation of controlled bottling operations during have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of company owned bottling plants included in our consolidated financial statements and in the number of our associates 
we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring  taking control of or managing bottling operations and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in restructuring and integrating them into our company s operating and internal control structures 
we may also experience delays in extending our company s internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired bottling operations which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in such operations financial records 
in addition  our financial performance and the strength and efficiency of the coca cola system depend in part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of company owned or controlled bottling operations 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for such bottling operations 

table of contents global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and financial results 
because of our global presence and worldwide operations  our business can be affected by large scale terrorist acts  especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries  the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities  major natural disasters  or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases such as avian influenza or severe acute respiratory syndrome generally known as sars 
such events could impair our ability to manage our business around the world  could disrupt our supply of raw materials  and could impact production  transportation and delivery of concentrates  syrups and finished products 
in addition  such events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity  which can affect consumers purchasing power in the affected areas and  therefore  reduce demand for our products
