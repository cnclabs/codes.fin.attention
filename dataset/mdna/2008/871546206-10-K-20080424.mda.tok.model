capital investment information concerning our capital expenditures is presented under the caption capital expenditures in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
customers we supply our products primarily to manufacturers in the medical device market 
our customers include all of the large orthopedic device manufacturers  including biomet inc  depuy inc 
a subsidiary of johnson johnson  medtronic sofamor danek  smith nephew plc  stryker corporation and zimmer holdings  inc we also have established relationships  primarily through our case product offerings  with leading medical device manufacturers and distributors in numerous other medical device market segments  including cardinal health  inc  i and st 
jude medical inc 
with the addition of ssi and uca  we now serve over  additional customers who own multiple hospitals 
we sold to approximately  customers in fiscal sales to our ten largest customers represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal and our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal our two largest customers in alphabetical order in fiscal were depuy and zimmer and our two largest customers in alphabetical order for fiscal were depuy and zimmer 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal or fiscal we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each of our largest customers  which mitigate our reliance on any particular customer 
we also reduced our concentration in the orthopedic industry with the acquisitions of riley medical  tnco  ssi and uca  which are primarily in non orthopedic medical markets  and clamonta ltd  which serves the aerospace industry 
we may experience a seasonal impact of the orthopedic industry on revenue in the third quarter because many of our products are used in elective procedures that tend to decline to some degree during the summer months 
we sell our products to customers domestically and in a number of regions outside the united states 
in addition  our customers often distribute globally products purchased from us in the united states 
set forth below is a summary of revenue by selected geographic locations in our last three fiscal years  based on the location to which we shipped our products percent of revenue by geographic location fiscal year ended restated restated united states united kingdom ireland other foreign countries total net revenues sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts emphasize our design and engineering expertise  internally developed symmetry products  manufacturing capabilities  international distribution network and our ability to provide customers with a comprehensive product offering 
we are increasingly presenting our products to customers in a total solutions concept which offers the customer a collaborator for developing complete implant  instrument and case solutions 
we have over sales and marketing personnel worldwide serving our original equipment manufacturer oem customers and more than direct sales personnel selling directly to hospitals through ssi and uca 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we also sell standard cases through distributors 
our sales personnel are trained in all of our products in order to cross sell and identify opportunities outside their immediate area of focus 
we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each oem customer which diminishes our reliance on any one purchasing decision 
our customer base for cases extends into nearly every segment of the medical device market 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our existing relationships among this customer base to achieve greater penetration of our customized instrument and implant products 
we intend to increase our marketing of implants  instruments and our total solutions concept to these customers 
our sales personnel are technically trained and are based in close proximity to or located at our largest customers sites 
this physical proximity allows sales personnel to engage quickly with the marketing  design  engineering and purchasing staffs of these orthopedic device manufacturers 
our sales people are empowered to bring in design and engineering product development teams to facilitate a customer s efforts 
our goal is to collaborate with customers early in the development cycle and to continue through production  packaging  delivery and logistics 
manufacturing we have manufacturing facilities in the united states  united kingdom  france  switzerland  ireland and malaysia 
we have made investments in recent years to modernize our production facilities  improve our production processes and develop superior technical skills that complement our manufacturing capabilities 
these investments have allowed us to continue to improve the quality of our products  increase our manufacturing capacity and improve our efficiency 
our manufacturing processes include forging 
our forging process uses presses to force heated metal between two dies called tooling that contain a precut profile of the desired implant 
the forging process enhances the strength of an implant  which is important for hip stems and other implants that must withstand significant stress 
many customers prefer forging because it provides greater mechanical properties 
we forge gross shaped  near net shaped and net shaped implants 
our know how enables us to produce precision net shaped forgings in large volumes 
casting 
in the casting process  metal is heated until it is liquid and then poured into an implant mold 
casting can be used to produce implants with intricate shapes 
we have developed a technologically advanced  highly automated  casting facility in sheffield  united kingdom 
plastic and metal forming 
our know how and technology facilitates our extensive plastic and metal forming capabilities 
we use thermo form processes to draw uniform plastic cases and specialized equipment to form metal 
our laser controlled metal working machines allow us to punch and shape metal in intricate and complex detail 
machining finishing 
machining is used extensively to enhance our forged  cast and formed products 
we use computer numerically controlled  multi axis and wire electric discharge equipment to cut  bend  punch  polish and otherwise shape or detail metal or plastic 
our finishing processes include polishing  laser etch marking  graphics and other customer specific processes 
the majority of products that we produce are customized to the unique specifications of our customers 
our ability to maintain flexible operations is an important factor in maintaining high levels of productivity 
we endeavor to use just in time manufacturing and flexible manufacturing cells in our production processes 
just in time manufacturing is a production technique that minimizes work in process inventory and manufacturing cycles 
manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations grouped in a circular configuration  with the operators placed centrally within the configuration 
cell manufacturing provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs  which enhances our ability to maintain product volumes that are consistent with our customers requirements and reduce our level of inventory 
we use raw materials  including titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other components in the manufacture of our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  from a single supplier for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases 
quality assurance we maintain a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control program  which includes the control and documentation of all material specifications  operating procedures  equipment maintenance and quality control methods 
our quality systems are based upon fda requirements and the iso standards for medical device manufacturers 
we believe that all of our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with regulations applicable to them 
for example  in the united states and united kingdom these regulations include the current good manufacturing practice regulations and other quality system regulations imposed by the fda 
our sheffield  united kingdom facility and our united states based facilities are registered with and audited by the fda 
our line of polyvac standard cases received fda k clearance  which can reduce our customers burden in obtaining fda approval 
our facilities have obtained numerous industry specific quality and regulatory assurance certifications 
competition our oem customers  to varying degrees  are capable of internally developing and producing the products we provide 
while we believe that our comprehensive offerings and core production competencies allow medical device companies to reduce costs and shorten time to market  one or more of our customers may seek to expand their development and manufacturing operations which may reduce their reliance on independent suppliers such as ours 
we compete on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  cost and on time delivery 
we also compete with independent suppliers of implants  instruments and cases to medical device companies 
the majority of these suppliers are privately owned and produce some  but not all  of the products required in orthopedic implant systems 
we believe that we are the only independent supplier to offer a complete implant  instrument and case solution to orthopedic device manufacturers 
we compete with other independent suppliers primarily on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  cost and on time delivery 
we believe that we are the largest independent supplier of implants  instruments and cases to orthopedic device manufacturers 
however  other independent suppliers may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing capabilities and brand recognition that are greater than ours 
intellectual property we believe our patents are valuable  however  our knowledge  experience  proprietary and trade secret information  manufacturing processes  product design and development staff and sales staff have been equally or more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we seek to protect our non patented know how  trade secrets  processes and other proprietary confidential information principally through confidentiality  non compete and invention assignment agreements 
we currently own total issued patents and patents pending related to our cases and instruments 
these patents expire at various times beginning in and ending in we also have patent applications at various stages of approval 
our policy is to aggressively protect technology  inventions and improvements that we consider important through the use of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets in the united states and significant foreign markets 
the acquisition of riley medical in may expanded our portfolio of patented case and tray products 
if our products were found to infringe any proprietary right of a third party  we could be required to pay significant damages or license fees to the third party or cease production  marketing and distribution of those products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information we own and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
we cannot provide complete assurance that our existing or future patents  if any  will afford adequate protection  that any existing patent applications will result in issued patents  that our patents will not be circumvented  invalidated  or held unenforceable  that our proprietary information will not become known to  or be independently developed by  our competitors  or that the validity or enforceability of any patents or other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us will be upheld if challenged by others in litigation 
due to these and other risks  we do not rely solely on our patents and other intellectual property to maintain our competitive position 
although intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset  we do not believe that any single patent  trade secret  trademark or copyright  or group of patents  trade secrets  trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business 
employees as of march  we had  employees 
our employees are not represented by any unions 
from time to time in the past  however  some of our employees have attempted to unionize at two of our facilities 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees 
government regulation our business is subject to governmental regulation 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission  discharge  use  storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of these materials at our facilities and at off site disposal locations 
we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws currently applicable to our business and we are not subject to any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any company facility or any off site location 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such environmental liabilities in the future as a result of historic or current operations 
as a component manufacturer  our medical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
the fda and related state and foreign governmental agencies regulate many of our customers products as medical devices 
in many cases  the fda must approve those products prior to commercialization 
we believe that our existing medical manufacturing plants comply with current good manufacturing practices as applicable 
we have master files on record with the fda 
master files may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities  processes  or articles used in the manufacturing  processing  packaging and storing of one or more medical device components 
these submissions may be used by device manufacturers to support the premarket notification process required by section k of the federal food drug cosmetic act 
this notification process is necessary to obtain clearance from the fda to market a device for human use in the united states 
we are also subject to various other environmental  transportation and labor laws as well as various other directives and regulations both in the us and abroad 
we believe that compliance with these laws will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
given the scope and nature of these laws  however  there can be no assurance that they will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we assess potential contingent liabilities on a quarterly basis 
at present  we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our business

risk factors our profitability is subject to risks described under this section on risk factors described below 
although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company  our business  financial condition or results of operations they could be materially adversely affected by many of the following risks 
risks related to our business we depend heavily on sales to our significant customers  and our business could be adversely affected if any of them reduced or terminated purchases from us 
a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers  all of whom are our customers  control the predominate share of the orthopedic device market 
we depend heavily on revenue from these large companies 
revenue from our ten largest customers represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year and of our revenue in fiscal year our two largest customers accounted for approximately and of our revenue in the fiscal year and our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
in addition  our customer base could become more concentrated if  among other things  there is further consolidation among orthopedic device manufacturers 
if a significant customer reduces or delays orders from us  terminates its relationship with us or fails to pay its obligations to us  our revenues could decrease significantly 
if we are unable to continue to improve our current products and develop new products  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete  and our business would be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers in markets that are characterized by technological change  product innovation and evolving industry standards 
we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  both in collaboration with our customers and independently 
our customers may engage in additional in house development and manufacturing  and we may be unable to compete effectively with our independent competitors  unless we can continue to develop and assist our customers in developing innovative products 
our competitors product development capabilities could become more effective than ours  and their new products may get to market before our products  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
if one or more of these events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
we face competition from our customers in house capabilities  established independent suppliers and potential new market entrants  and if we lose customers it could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
our customers have varying degrees of development and manufacturing capabilities  and one or more of them may seek to expand their in house capabilities in the future  including adding capacity in existing sites or expanding into low labor cost areas such as asia 
many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and can commit significant resources to product development and manufacturing 
most of our independent competitors are smaller companies  many of which have close customer relationships and either a low cost structure or highly specialized design or production capabilities 
our independent competitors may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing and manufacturing capabilities or brand recognition that are greater than ours 
in addition  the innovative nature of our markets may attract new entrants to the field 
our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies  which could result in the loss of customers and  as a result  decreased revenue and operating results 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us or our customers our business may be harmed 
the manufacture and sale of our healthcare and other products  including our aerospace products  expose us to potential product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of  or design or manufacturing flaws in  our products  or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or otherwise require us to pay significant damages  which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
we carry product liability insurance but it is limited in scope and amount and may not be adequate to protect us against product liability claims 
we may be unable to maintain this insurance at reasonable costs and on reasonable terms  if at all 
our operating results are subject to significant potential fluctuation and you should not rely on historical results as an indication of our future results 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year in the future due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the timing of significant orders and shipments  including the effects of changes in inventory management practices by our customers  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us  our customers and our competitors  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in medical treatment or regulatory practices  restrictions and delays caused by regulatory review of our customers products  recalls of our customers products  availability and cost of raw materials  and general economic factors 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
if we do not retain key individuals and retain and attract skilled manufacturing workers  we may not be able to operate successfully  and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our success depends in part upon the retention of key managerial  sales and technical personnel  particularly skilled manufacturing workers 
we compete for such personnel with other companies and other organizations  many of which are larger and have greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 
we compete with numerous precision manufacturing companies to attract and retain qualified and highly skilled manufacturing employees 
our warsaw  indiana facilities  in particular  face significant competition  including from certain of our customers and other companies located in or near warsaw that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do  for skilled production employees 
if we are not able to retain and attract skilled manufacturing employees  we may be unable to support our anticipated growth  which could adversely affect our profitability 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could make our products obsolete or less attractive 
the development of new technologies could reduce demand for our products 
for example  pharmaceutical advances could result in non surgical treatments gaining more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopedic implants 
the emergence of successful new biological tissue based or synthetic materials to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged tissue could increasingly minimize or delay the need for implant surgery and provide other biological alternatives to orthopedic implants 
new surgical procedures could diminish demand for our instruments 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could adversely affect demand for our products 
we depend on third party suppliers  and in some cases a single third party supplier  for key components and raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and the loss of these sources could harm our business 
we use titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other raw materials in our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases from a single supplier 
any supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be found 
we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
this could interrupt our business or reduce the quality of our products 
if we are unable to manage changes in our business  our business could be harmed 
since the end of  we have completed six acquisitions 
these acquisitions have increased the size and scope of our operations 
in recent years  our business expanded through organic growth and acquisitions  and we believe we will continue to expand 
this continued expansion may place a strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to execute our anticipated expansion successfully  we must attract and retain qualified personnel and manage and train them effectively 
any failure by us to expand and train our work force or increase production capacity or otherwise manage our expansion effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate all acquisitions 
our current or future levels of indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business  finance acquisitions and pursue new business strategies 
as of december   our total indebtedness  including short term debt  long term debt and capital lease obligations was million 
due to the discovery of accounting irregularities at our sheffield operating unit  we experienced an event of default under our senior credit agreement 
on october   we entered into a forbearance agreement with our lenders 
in the forbearance agreement  the lenders agreed to forbear  until january   from exercising their rights and remedies available to them under the credit agreement with respect to the events of default  including their right to accelerate the financial obligations of the company under the credit agreement 
during the forbearance period  revolving loans  swingline loans and letters of credit were not available to the company 
as of december   we obtained a waiver from our lenders which allowed us to close on a million term loan a in january  of which million was used to fund the new bedford acquisition and million was used to pay down our revolving line of credit facilities 
presently  we have available million of borrowings under our million revolving credit facility and million of term loans  however  under an agreement with our lenders  we are limited in our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility until such time as our sec filings are current and all requirements of our credit agreement are satisfied 
although covenants under our senior credit facility limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  in the future we may incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  business opportunities  capital expenditures or other capital requirements 
our indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions  make it more difficult to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations for making payments on our indebtedness  which would prevent us from using it for other purposes  make us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent that our variable rate debt is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements  and make it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and collaborations 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that  based upon current levels of operations  we will be able to meet our debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among others  that we will continue to be successful in implementing our business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business  liquidity or capital requirements 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments  we may be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
we cannot assure you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments 
to the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations in the future  the risks associated with our indebtedness described above  including our possible inability to service our debt  would increase 
our senior credit facility contains restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  make acquisitions and make other investments 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not satisfy these tests or comply with these ratios  our creditors could declare a default under our debt instruments  and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our senior credit facility may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
our senior credit facility also contains covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness  acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures  and impose various other restrictions 
these covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
we may be unable to comply with the foregoing financial ratios or covenants and  if we fail to do so  we may be unable to obtain waivers from our lenders 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue generated by sales of our products  expenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products  costs of developing new products or technologies  costs associated with capital expenditures  costs associated with our expansion  costs associated with regulatory compliance  including maintaining compliance with the quality system regulations imposed by the fda  the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions  working capital requirements related to our growing new acquisitions  and expansion of our international facilities 
as a result of these factors  we may need to raise additional funds  and these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  execute our business strategy  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements 
we may not realize all of the sales expected from new product development programs 
we incur substantial expenses in developing and testing new products and related devices 
the realization of additional revenue from new product development efforts is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  including  directly or indirectly  end user acceptance of the product  reimbursement approval of third party payers such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers and  in some cases  fda or comparable foreign regulatory approval of the product 
in addition  our customers typically have no contractual requirement to purchase from us the products that we develop for their medical devices  and they could seek to have another supplier or in house facilities manufacture products that we have developed for their medical devices 
we also incur costs and make capital expenditures for new product development and production based upon certain estimates of production volumes for our existing and anticipated products 
if the actual demand for our products is less than planned  our revenue and net income may decline 
our earnings could decline if we write off additional goodwill or intangible assets created as a result of our various acquisitions 
as a result of acquisitions we have accumulated a substantial amount of goodwill  amounting to million as of december   or approximately of our total assets as of such date 
goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment by us annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances develop that would likely result in impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal or business climate  an adverse regulatory action  unanticipated competition or financial restatements 
we completed our annual impairment test effective october  and determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within our sheffield  uk reporting unit were impaired 
based upon our analysis under sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  we determined that the book value of the goodwill at the sheffield  uk reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair market value of this unit resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million 
we also determined that the book value of our customer related intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair market value by million 
the impairments of goodwill and intangible assets were the result of the lower operating results after the restatement of our historical financial statements and revisions to our future outlook 
our october  and october  annual impairment tests did not result in the impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets at any reporting unit within the company 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights  or are subject to intellectual property claims by third parties  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement  misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  or at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive advantages 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and customers 
we cannot assure you  however  that these agreements will not be breached  we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
we hold licenses with third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we are infringing  misappropriating or violating their intellectual property rights 
we could be found to infringe those intellectual property rights  which could affect our ability to manufacture any affected product 
in addition  any protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could drain our financial resources  divert the time and effort of our management and cause customers to delay or limit their purchases of the affected product until resolution of the litigation 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign or  in the case of trademark claims  rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming if it is possible to do so 
efforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations  and if we complete additional acquisitions  we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems 
since  we have completed six acquisitions 
going forward  we may seek to acquire additional businesses or product lines for various reasons  including providing new product manufacturing capabilities  adding new customers  increasing penetration with existing customers or expanding into new geographic markets 
our ability to successfully grow through additional acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings 
these additional efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and integration of our recently completed acquisitions 
if we complete additional acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these businesses  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer reaction to the business combination 
additional acquisitions could also materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
we are subject to risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have significant international operations and we continue to expand and grow these operations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  switzerland  ireland and malaysia 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country  general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate or where end users of orthopedic devices reside may have an adverse effect on our operations  difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial results 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to  among other things  changes in local  regional or global economic conditions  the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs incurred in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we may be adversely affected as a result of the long lead times required for sales of certain new products 
we often compete for business at the beginning of the development of new medical devices or upon customer redesign of existing medical devices 
our customers generally must obtain clearance or approval from the fda before commercially distributing their products 
unless exempt  a new medical device must be approved for commercial distribution in the united states by the fda through the k pre market notification process or  in some cases  through the more burdensome pre market approval  or pma  process 
it generally takes three to six months from the date of submission to the fda to obtain k clearance and one to three years from the date of submission to the fda to obtain approval through the pma process  but in each case may take significantly longer 
this results in long lead times for some of our customers new products  which may make it difficult in the short term for us to obtain sales of new products to replace any unexpected decline in sales of existing products 
we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 
currently  none of our facilities are unionized 
however  from time to time some of our employees have attempted to unionize at two of our facilities 
in addition  some of our orthopedic device customers have unionized work forces 
while we have not experienced any adverse effects from work stoppages or slow downs at our customers facilities  work stoppages or slow downs experienced by us  our suppliers or our customers or their suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of facilities where our products are made or used 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter strikes  further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes one or more of our manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline 
we have twenty one manufacturing facilities  which are located in the united states  united kingdom france  switzerland  ireland and malaysia 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment and personnel know how that we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event that one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to attempt to shift production to our other manufacturing facilities or rely on third party manufacturers  and our other facilities or a third party manufacturer may not have the capability to effectively supply the affected products 
although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business  this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
risks related to our industry orthopedic device manufacturers have significant leverage over their independent suppliers and consolidation could increase their leverage  which could result in the loss of customers or force us to reduce our prices 
we compete with many distributors and manufacturers to develop and supply implants  surgical instruments and cases to a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers 
as a result  orthopedic device manufacturers have historically had significant leverage over their independent suppliers 
for example  independent suppliers like us are subject to continuing pressure from the major orthopedic device manufacturers to reduce the cost of products while maintaining quality levels 
in recent years  the medical device industry has experienced substantial consolidation 
if the medical device industry and the orthopedic device industry in particular  continue to consolidate  competition to provide products to orthopedic device manufacturers may become more intense 
orthopedic device manufacturers may seek to use their market power to negotiate price or other concessions for our products 
if we are forced to reduce prices or if we lose customers because of competition  our revenue and results of operations would suffer 
our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment measures and other industry trends affecting pricing that could result in reduced sales of or prices for our products 
acceptance of our customers products by hospitals  outpatient centers and physicians depend on  among other things  reimbursement approval of third party payers such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers 
the continuing efforts of government  insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to lower reimbursement rates or non reimbursement for medical procedures that use our products 
if that were to occur  medical device manufacturers might insist that we lower prices on products related to the affected medical device or they might significantly reduce or eliminate their purchases from us of these related products  which could affect our profitability 
we and our customers are subject to substantial government regulation that is subject to change and could force us to make modifications to how we develop  manufacture and price our products 
the medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
some of our manufacturing processes are required to comply with quality systems regulations  including current good manufacturing practice requirements that cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging and shipping of our products 
further  some of our facilities  records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the fda or other agencies 
failure to comply with applicable medical device regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  repairs  replacements  refunds  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  refusal of the fda or other regulatory agencies to grant future pre market clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition  orthopedic implants and other medical devices produced by our customers are subject to intensive regulation and potential pre approval requirements by the fda and similar international agencies that govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
compliance with these regulations may be time consuming  burdensome and expensive for our customers and  indirectly  for us to the extent that our customers compliance depends on our operations 
these regulations could negatively affect our customers abilities to sell their products  which in turn would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
this may result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
the regulations that we and our customers are subject to are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state levels 
in addition  these regulations may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations  higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
if our customers fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals to commercially distribute our future products our ability to sell our products could suffer 
some of our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulatory pre approval by the fda and other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
our customers are typically responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products 
the process of obtaining this approval  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda  for example  assigns medical devices to one of three classes which determine  among other things  the type and degree of fda approval required to commercially distribute the device in the united states 
we produce class i  ii and iii devices 
class i devices are deemed to present little risk to patients and are generally exempt from fda approval requirements 
class ii devices can generally be commercially distributed only after the device has received k clearance 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if certain design  testing and validation requirements are met and it is demonstrated that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that was legally marketed prior to may   or to another commercially available device subsequently cleared through the k pre market notification process 
this process generally takes three to six months  but may take substantially longer 
before a class iii device can be commercially distributed in the united states  a pre market approval  or pma  must be obtained from the fda 
the pma process can be expensive and uncertain  requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and other data and generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
the commercial distribution of any products we develop that require regulatory clearance may be delayed 
in addition  because we cannot assure you that any new products or any product enhancements we develop for commercial distribution in the united states will be exempt from the fda market clearance requirements or subject to the shorter k clearance process  the regulatory approval process for our products or product enhancements may take significantly longer than anticipated by us or our customers 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could incur fines  penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time  and we could incur material expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws 
in addition  we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
such costs could be material 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
risks relating to our common stock our common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially 
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the medical device industry  including our company  which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  our announcements or our competitors announcements regarding new products  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  loss of any of our key management or technical personnel  conditions affecting orthopedic device manufacturers or the medical device industry generally  product liability lawsuits against us or our customers  clinical trial results with respect or our customers medical devices  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights  or those of our competitors  fda and international actions with respect to the government regulation of medical devices and third party reimbursement practices  public concern as to the safety of our products  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  conditions in the financial markets in general or changes in general economic conditions  our inability to raise additional capital  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or the medical device industry generally  or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors and five percent stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock  changes in accounting principles  and announcement of financial restatements 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities or financial restatements  litigation has often been brought against that company 
if litigation of this type is brought against us  it could be extremely expensive and divert management s attention and the company s resources 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law  our certificate of incorporation and our by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  limiting the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  and authorizing of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and shares of our common stock 
we are also protected by section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals were obtained 
as a result of our discovery of accounting irregularities at our sheffield  uk operating unit and the related restatement  the sec has initiated an informal investigation  which may not be resolved favorably 
following the discovery of the accounting irregularities at our sheffield  uk operating unit  the audit committee self reported the matter to the staff of the sec 
thereafter  the sec commenced an informal inquiry regarding this matter 
we intend to fully cooperate with the sec in its investigation 
at this time we are unable to predict the time period necessary to resolve the investigation or the ultimate resolution thereof 
to date  considerable legal  tax and accounting expenses have been incurred in connection with our audit committee s investigation into this matter and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future with regard to the sec s investigation 
it is also possible that the investigation may continue to require a significant amount of management time and attention and accounting and legal resources  which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
moreover  any action by the sec against us  or members of our management  may cause us to be subject to injunctions  fines and other penalties or sanctions or result in private civil actions  loss of key personnel or other adverse consequences and may require us to devote additional time and resources to these matters 
the investigation may adversely affect our ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the sec investigation and the remedies applied may affect certain of our business relationships and consequently may have an adverse effect on our business in the future 
we face risks relating to our ineffective internal controls 
as a result of our review of issues identified during the recently completed independent audit committee investigation into certain accounting and financial reporting matters  as well as our internal review  management has identified several deficiencies in our control environment that constitute material weaknesses and  consequently  has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at december  if we are unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses in a timely manner  investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could lead to a decline in our stock price  limit our ability to access the capital markets in the future  and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures

selling  general and administrative adjustments include the reversal of amortization expense related to performance based restricted stock awards which are no longer probable of vesting due to the lower restated financial results at sheffield 
other expense adjustments are due primarily to revised foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with the restated accounts receivable balances 
income tax expense adjustments result from the tax impacts of the restatement adjustments to pre tax income at the uk statutory rate of 
certain of the above mentioned errors and irregularities date back to prior periods including the opening balance sheet established at the time of the acquisition of the sheffield operation in the adjustments to the opening balance sheet results in an increase to goodwill of approximately million 
in addition  utilizing the restated operating results we determined that carrying value of the sheffield reporting unit was in excess of its fair value 
the impairment analysis resulted in the write off of goodwill and intangibles of million in item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition explanatory note regarding our restatement on october   we issued a press release and filed a current report on form k with the securities and exchange commission the sec in which we announced that  due to the apparent overstatement of revenues by our sheffield  united kingdom uk operating unit  it may be necessary for us to restate our financial statements for the periods subsequent to june  and that as a result our historical financial statements for those periods can no longer be relied upon 
on november   we filed a current report on form k with the sec in which we announced that the potential irregularities in the financial reporting by our sheffield  uk operating unit also includes the overstatement of inventory and other matters 
the sheffield  uk operating unit is part of our thornton precision components limited subsidiary 
this form k reflects the restatement of i our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the and fiscal years including the interim periods within and the first and second quarters of fiscal  ii selected financial data for the   and fiscal years  and iii management s discussion and analysis  based on the restated annual and quarterly financial information 
these adjustments are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
along with this report  we are filing our amended quarterly reports on form q a for the first and second quarters of fiscal and the delayed third quarter of fiscal on form q 
we do not intend to amend our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods prior to fiscal the financial information that was presented in previous filings or otherwise reported for these periods is amended by the information in this annual report on form k 
the financial statements and related financial information contained in such previously filed reports should no longer be relied upon 
upon discovery of the accounting irregularities  the audit committee engaged special legal counsel who in turn retained independent forensic accountants  to investigate and report to the audit committee 
that investigation has concluded that the irregularities were isolated to our sheffield  uk operating unit 
we have quantified the impact of the irregularities identified at our sheffield  uk operating unit and are restating our financial statements to correct those irregularities 
the restatements correct misstatements within accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  property  plant and equipment and the corresponding income tax and profit and loss impacts 
the cumulative impact of these restatements reduced net income by million through january  additionally  fiscal year and net income was reduced by million and million  respectively 
finally  approximately million of the restatement relates to periods prior to our acquisition of the sheffield  uk operating unit 
therefore  this adjustment is reflected as a change to the opening balance sheet related to that acquisition and increases goodwill by approximately million 
because the restatement reduced our operating results during these periods  our goodwill impairment test indicated the carrying value of goodwill and related customer intangibles exceeded fair value at our sheffield  uk operating unit 
consequently  we recognized a million impairment charge to write off the goodwill and a customer relationship intangible 
the audit committee engaged ernst young llp to audit our restated consolidated financial statements for fiscal and  while simultaneously completing its audit of our fiscal year 
ernst young llp was also engaged to re review our quarterly consolidated financial statements for fiscal and the adjustments made as a result of the restatements are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

we expect tnco sales to benefit significantly as a result of marketing the tnco products through the symmetry global sales and distribution network 
tnco s pre acquisition management team remained in place and continues to lead this business unit 
this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to enhance symmetry medical s product offering into medical markets beyond our existing products and allows us to offer our total solutions r model to an expanded customer base 
in august  we acquired ssi and uca located in nashville  tennessee for approximately million in cash 
at the same time we entered into a two year earn out agreement with the two principals of ssi and uca who will receive additional consideration if ssi and uca meet certain earnings levels for the identified years 
ssi was a privately held company that has a year history of offering targeted sales  marketing and distribution programs to serve the key surgical specialties of neurological  spine  cardiovascular  ent  laparoscopy  ophthalmology and orthopedics 
ssi s portfolio includes its own line of ultra instruments and includes the uca ultra container sterilization system  a hospital proven  closed container system that is designed to store and transport sterilized instruments 
the ultra instruments  uca containers and multiple other product lines are offered through ssi s distribution channels and sold to hospitals with over direct sales personnel on their staff 
ssi and uca reported revenues of million 
ssi and uca s pre acquisition management team continues to lead this business unit 
this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to enhance symmetry medical s product offering into medical markets beyond our existing products and provides a direct access to hospitals and doctors to accelerate our own product designs 
in january  we purchased substantially all of the assets and real estate of new bedford for approximately million in cash 
new bedford produces orthopedic instruments  general medical instruments and some small spine related implants 
currently  of the products produced at the facility are for depuy 
in the future  we plan to utilize this facility to serve our other medical customers 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a supply agreement which requires depuy to make minimum purchases from new bedford for a four year period 
the agreement stipulates that these purchases are incremental to other products we presently or previously produced on depuy s behalf 
the commitment from depuy totals million over the four year period 
certain key members of new bedford s pre acquisition management team continue to lead this business unit 
we believe this acquisition strengthens our position as a leading provider to the orthopedic industry and provides additional manufacturing capacity to better serve our broad customer base  builds on our relationship with depuy  expands our east coast presence and allows us to move forward with an existing skilled workforce to service our growing market 
our acquisitions have afforded us the opportunity to offer a comprehensive line of implants  surgical instruments and cases for orthopedic device manufacturers on a global basis  instruments and cases into other medical markets and specialized parts into the aerospace industry 
during fiscal  we sold our products to approximately  customers 
our two largest customers accounted for approximately and of our revenue in fiscal and our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal our ten largest customers collectively accounted for approximately and of our revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
within each of our largest customers  we typically serve several product teams and facilities  which reduces our reliance on any single purchasing decision 
approximately   and of our revenue in fiscal and approximately   and of our revenue in fiscal was from sales to the united states  united kingdom  ireland and other foreign countries  respectively 
we believe that we have well established relationships with our major customers and these relationships to a significant extent involve the sale of products that we have developed or modified specifically for our customers particular product lines 
in connection with the launch of a new implant system  our customers typically provide a customized implant specific instrument set in cases to end users hospitals  outpatient centers and physicians for use with the new implant system 
as a result  our sales of instruments and cases in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new product launch activity by our customers 
our revenue from the sale of implants  instruments  cases and other products represented   and respectively  of our revenue in fiscal  compared with   and respectively  of our revenue in fiscal our management reviews and analyzes trends and key performance indicators in order to manage our business 
to assist us in evaluating our capacity  we monitor long term trends in the orthopedic industry  which currently include the growing elderly population  general aging of the population  affluent and active baby boomers  improving technologies that expand the market  including minimally invasive surgeries  and other factors 
further  we consider the information obtained from discussions with our customers on the upcoming demand for our products  including new product launches 
we use this information to determine an appropriate level of capital expenditures to meet the anticipated demand for our products 
in and we chose to maintain our capital assets in place during an industry slow down so we could quickly respond when the market growth resumed which we observed during the second half of into on an ongoing basis  our management considers several variables associated with the ongoing operations of the business  including scheduled production  utilization of machinery and equipment  monitoring purchasing activity and inventory levels and associated costs  headcount  overhead costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our revenues are affected by changes in the number and size of orders and the timing of delivery dates 
our revenues have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to the effects of changes in inventory management practices and new product introductions by our customers 
results of operations the table below sets forth certain operating data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

the increase in implant revenue for fiscal was primarily driven by the acquisition of everest metal in august which added additional revenue during the increase in instrument revenues for fiscal was primarily driven by our ssi acquisition in september which added million of revenue and the addition of our tnco acquisition in april which added million of revenue 
case revenues increased million for fiscal primarily due to increase in overall sales to our top five customers related to a significant increase in demand for new product launches and the inclusion of a full year of sales for riley medical following its acquisition in may the increase in other revenue was driven by the acquisition of clamonta completed in january  which added million of revenue 
change in foreign exchange rates positively affected our total year revenue by million 
we estimate that global orthopedic device procedures grew at approximately to in and expect similar industry procedure growth in the near future 
in the second half of and the first half of  our customers used inventory that had built up in their distribution channel because of their reduced growth in the first quarter of during the second half of  demand from our major customers returned to more normalized rates and was complemented by an increase in our customers new product launches 
our customer demand continues to build and the overall fundamentals continue to be positive in the global orthopedic industry which will continue to provide growth for our customers and us into the future 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal gross profit was positively impacted by the million increase in revenue driven by our and acquisitions 
however  this positive impact was more than offset by the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue of 
this decline was driven by higher raw material costs at several of our operations as a percentage of selling price due to higher material costs during the period 
also impacting our gross profit percentage was a reduced leveraging of fixed costs at our us operations which experienced a decline in revenues during the period while maintaining their cost structures to be prepared for the anticipated ramp up in production experienced in the latter half of and expected in finally  our sheffield  uk operation experienced significantly higher costs as a percentage of revenue driven by higher fixed costs for depreciation  the adverse impacts of a flood during the second quarter  and other increased costs of manufacturing related to poor operational management 
we have commenced a full and complete review of sheffield s operations and anticipate significant improvements in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of million of expenses related to clamonta  tnco  ssi  uca  riley medical and everest metal since their respective dates of acquisition 
these expenses include million of amortization related to intangibles acquired in our recent acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenue in fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of revenue was driven by the million of professional fees and expenses incurred in to complete the sheffield  uk investigation and related restatement 
changes in foreign exchange rates increased our selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
other income expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase primarily reflects expense from the increase in debt incurred for acquisitions 
the derivatives loss in fiscal consisted of a million loss on interest rate swap valuation and a million loss on foreign currency forward valuations 
the interest rate swaps are used to convert our variable rate long term debt to fixed rates 
the foreign currency forwards are used to mitigate fluctuations in foreign currency on the statement of operations 
the loss of the foreign currency valuation for fiscal offset unrealized gains on foreign currency within the other expense of million 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was significantly impacted by a valuation allowance on the net operating loss carry forward at our sheffield  uk subsidiary of million and a million reserve for uncertain tax positions 
excluding these two items  the tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in  benefits from research and development and other state credits  and income in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates more than offset the impact of state income taxes

fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal revenue for each of our principal product categories in these periods was as follows product category restated restated in millions implants instruments cases other total the million decrease in revenue resulted from decreased instrument and implant sales of million and million  respectively  offset by increased case and other sales of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in both instrument and implant revenues for fiscal was primarily driven by overall reduced sales to our top five customers related to significant reductions in demand due to a reduction of new product launches coupled with their efforts to reduce levels of instrument inventory during these factors were partially offset by the inclusion of approximately million of implant revenue from everest metal since the date of acquisition 
case revenues increased million for fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of million from riley medical since the date of acquisition partially offset by a significant reduction in overall sales to our top five customers related to a significant reduction in demand for new product launches 
other revenue increased from growth in existing operations driven by sales to the growing aerospace industry 
we estimate that global orthopedic device procedures grew at approximately to in in  our customers growth slowed from a robust and time period 
our customers adjusted to this slower growth rate by using inventory and reducing the purchases of instrument and case sets 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal this decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of the decrease in sales combined with an increase from depreciation expense as a result of capital expenditures for expansion during and an unfavorable shift in product mix resulting in lower sales of higher margin products 
these factors were partially offset by gross margins generated by riley medical and everest metal since their respective dates of acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin was for the fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by lower volume resulting in the spreading of fixed costs such as depreciation over reduced sales 
a significant component of our fixed costs relates to depreciation expense  which due to our significant capital expenditures in  and  increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of million of expenses related to riley medical and everest metal since their respective dates of acquisition 
these expenses include million of amortization related to intangibles acquired in these acquisitions 
the increase in expenses from the acquisitions was partially offset by cost control efforts and reductions in employee incentive compensation costs 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenue in fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of revenue was driven by the decrease in revenue 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we completed our annual impairment test effective october  and determined that the goodwill and certain intangible assets within our sheffield  uk reporting unit were impaired 
we determined that the book value of the reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair market value of the reporting unit as determined using the present value of expected future cash flows on the assessment date 
after calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit  it was determined that the recorded goodwill was impaired by approximately million 
for our amortizing customer related intangible asset  we determined that the book value of the intangible asset exceeded the estimated fair market value of the intangible resulting in the impairment charge of million 
the goodwill and intangible assets total impairment of million was the result of the revision to expected future cash flows associated with this operation after corrections for the accounting irregularities 
other income expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase primarily reflects expense from the increase in debt incurred for the riley medical and everest metal acquisitions 
the derivatives loss in fiscal consisted of a million loss on interest rate swap valuation and a million loss on foreign currency forward valuations 
the interest rate swaps are used to convert our variable rate long term debt to fixed rates 
the foreign currency forwards are used to mitigate fluctuations in foreign currency on the statement of operations 
the loss of the foreign currency valuation for fiscal offset unrealized gains on foreign currency within the other expense of million 
approximately million of other expense for fiscal was due to costs paid in connection with the secondary public offering completed in the third quarter of provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate of in benefited from research and development and other state credits  income from foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates offset in part by the impact of state income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was significantly impacted by the impairment of nondeductible goodwill

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity in fiscal were cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit and term debt facility 
principal uses of cash in fiscal included the financing of working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund million for our acquisitions 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to finance working capital  acquisitions and capital expenditures as well as to service debt 
in january  we incurred a new million term loan with a five year maturity to fund the million depuy new bedford acquisition and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash in the periods presented fiscal year ended in millions cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on changes in cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
we generated cash from operations of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in net income partially offset by increases in net working capital in fiscal that exceeded fiscal working capital generated an additional million of cash in compared to primarily due to the increases in taxes receivable and accrued expenses and other as cash generated from the combination of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable was relatively consistent 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to the increase in legal and professional fees related to the sheffield matter as well as due to the amount and timing of payment of employee compensation related costs 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal our investing activities in fiscal consisted of million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisitions of clamonta  tnco  ssi and uca 
these expenditures were partially offset by the sale of excess land in the uk of million 
investing activities in fiscal consisted of million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisitions of riley medical and everest metal 
financing activities 
financing activities provided million of cash in fiscal this increase in cash is primarily due to million borrowings from our line of credit used to finance the clamonta  tnco  ssi and uca acquisitions offset by debt repayments 
this is compared to the proceeds of million used to finance the riley medical acquisition 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and were primarily used to expand and enhance production capacity in several of our facilities 
in  we replaced equipment and increased capacity with new equipment 
in  we added a new  square foot design and development facility in warsaw  indiana  and we built a new  square foot forging facility and expanded press capacity in sheffield  uk 
in addition  we moved our existing villeneuve d ascq  france case facility to a newly constructed  larger facility in villeneuve d ascq  france and moved our cheltenham  uk facility to a newer and larger leased facility 
we expect capital expenditures for fiscal to total approximately million 
debt and credit facilities in connection with our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility  consisting of a million five year term loan term loan a and a million five year revolving credit facility 
in the second quarter of  we amended and restated this credit facility to increase our term loans by million term loan a and extended the revolving credit facility to june as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  which consisted of the following an aggregate of million of borrowings under our senior credit facility  and million of capital lease obligations 
borrowings under this senior credit facility bear interest at a floating rate  which is either a base rate  or at our option  a london interbank offered rate libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
as of december   an aggregate of million was outstanding under the term loans at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   we had million borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding letters of credit as of december  historically  we have had a significant amount of variable rate long term indebtedness 
we have managed our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting under the applicable accounting guidelines and  as a result  we are required to record changes to the fair market value of these agreements in our statement of operations for each period 
we recorded interest rate swap valuation expense income of million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks interest rate risk 
the term loans require quarterly payments of scheduled principal and interest  with annual scheduled principal payments increasing each year 
term loan a matures in december the term loan a and borrowings under the revolving credit facility mature in june the senior credit agreement credit agreement contains various financial covenants  including covenants requiring a maximum total debt to ebitda ratio  minimum ebitda to interest ratio and a minimum ebitda to fixed charges ratio 
the credit agreement also contains covenants restricting certain corporate actions  including asset dispositions  acquisitions  payment of dividends and certain other restricted payments  changes of control  incurring indebtedness  incurring liens  making loans and investments and transactions with affiliates 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
our credit agreement also contains customary events of default 
as previously disclosed  we discovered accounting irregularities at our sheffield  uk operating unit  resulting in our lender s administrative agent s notice to the company that a default had occurred under the credit agreement 
on october   we entered into a forbearance agreement under which the lenders agreed to forbear  until january   from exercising their rights and remedies available to them under the credit agreement  with respect to the events of default 
on december   the company  certain of the company s subsidiaries  and wachovia bank  national association  as administrative agent  entered into a waiver  amendment and term a loan incremental term loan amendment to amended and restated credit agreement waiver 
pursuant to the terms of the waiver  the administrative agent waived specified events of default existing under the credit agreement 
in addition  the administrative agent  on behalf of itself and certain other lenders  i consented to the new bedford acquisition  ii committed to extend additional senior secured credit in the aggregate amount of  the incremental term loan or term loan a  and iii modified the terms of the credit agreement accordingly 
proceeds of the incremental term loan were used to fund the new bedford acquisition  to pay  in part  the company s existing revolving credit facility  and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the waiver 
on january   the new bedford acquisition was completed and term loan a was funded 
term loan a will mature june  quarterly installments of principal are to be paid so as to reduce the principal balance by five percent in  ten percent in  fifteen percent in and seventy percent in we retain the right to have borrowed funds bear interest at the libor plus an applicable margin or at a base rate plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins for all borrowings have been modified under the waiver  and until such time as the company is current in filing its reports under section and d of the securities exchange act  as amended  all applicable margins are increased by and the margins are to be determined as though the company s total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to to in addition  until such time as the company is current in filing its reports under the securities exchange act  the company is limited in our ability to borrow under its current revolving credit facility 
other terms of the credit agreement remain substantially unchanged by the waiver 
on march   the company and wachovia bank  national association  as administrative agent  entered into a second amendment and waiver to the amended and restated credit agreement second amendment for purposes of waiving events of default under the credit agreement relating to the sheffield accounting irregularities and the company s filing deadlines 
the second amendment allows for a write off of goodwill and provides for other one time allowance adjustments in calculating the financial impact of the sheffield accounting irregularities 
in addition  the second amendment extended the deadline for the company to file its audited financial statements and reports under sections and d of the securities exchange act to april  on april   the company notified the administrative agent that the filing of its annual report on form k would be extended beyond the april  target date  certain other financial statements as required by the credit agreement would be provided beyond the time established by the credit agreement  and that professional fees incurred in connection with the sheffield accounting irregularities would cause the company to be unable to comply with a financial covenant of the credit agreement 
the administrative agent  for the company s lenders  informed the company that an event of default occurred due to these circumstances 
under the circumstances  the administrative agent had the right to accelerate the financial obligations of the company under the credit agreement  but did not 
on april   the company and wachovia bank  national association  as administrative agent  entered into a third amendment and waiver to amended and restated credit agreement for the purpose of waiving the described defaults 
accordingly  the corporation obtained from the lenders i a waiver for its event of default  ii an extension of the deadline by which the corporation is required to file its form k  and iii an extension of the deadline by which the corporation is required to file its first quarter quarterly report on form q 
in addition  the corporation obtained changes to the credit agreement which includes temporary adjustments to its financial statement covenants 
we hold certain property and equipment pursuant to capital leases 
as of december   these leases have future minimum lease payments of million  million  million  million and million in each of the next fiscal years and million thereafter 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  including at least the next twelve months 
we regularly review acquisitions and other strategic opportunities  which may require additional debt or equity financing contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total represents principal maturities only and  therefore  excludes the effects of interest and interest rate swaps

liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million are excluded as reasonable estimates could not be made regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements include our operating leases and letters of credit  which are available under the senior credit facility 
we had no letters of credit outstanding as of december  environmental our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes  the cleanup of contamination  and the health and safety of our employees 
under such laws and regulations  we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
we could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures for environmental  health and safety in both and during we upgraded our hvac and dust collection system at multiple locations 
in connection with our acquisitions of tnco  ssi and new bedford we completed phase i assessments and did not find any significant issues that need to be remediated 
we cannot be certain that environmental issues will not be discovered or arise in the future related to these acquisitions 
in conjunction with the new bedford acquisition  we purchased million of environmental insurance coverage for this facility 
this the policy period expires january  in  we purchased pollution legal liability insurance that covers certain environmental liabilities that may arise at our warsaw  indiana facility  at a former facility located in peru  indiana  and at certain non owned locations that we use for the disposal of waste 
the insurance has a million aggregate limit and is subject to a deductible and certain exclusions 
the policy period expires in while the insurance may mitigate the risk of certain environmental liabilities  we cannot guarantee that a particular liability will be covered by this insurance

the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  we perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal or business climate or an adverse regulatory action 
we completed our annual impairment test effective october  and determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within our sheffield  uk reporting unit were impaired 
for goodwill  we determined that the book value of the sheffield  uk reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair market value of the reporting unit as determined using the present value of expected future cash flows on the assessment date 
expected future cash flows were derived from the restated results of operations which reflect lower operating income than previously reported 
we applied future growth and operation expense projections which we believe represented reasonable estimates of the underlying business conditions at that time 
after calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit  it was determined that the recorded goodwill was impaired by approximately million 
for our customer related intangible asset  we determined that the book value of the intangible asset exceeded the estimated fair market value of the intangible resulting in the impairment of the recorded intangible asset of million revision 
we modeled a variety of scenarios when conducting our impairment analyses 
however  such alternatives would not have materially modified the extent of the impairment charge or the period in which it was recognized 
our october  and october  annual impairment tests did not result in the impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets at any reporting unit within the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of our fixed rate and variable rate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
the weighted average interest rate for this debt in was 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million  before giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements described below 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts million of our variable rate term loans into a fixed rate obligation for an approximately three year period ending june  we receive payments at variable rates  while we make payments at a fixed rate at december  
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge million of outstanding long term debt at a fixed payment obligation of per annum for the period commencing on june  and ending on december  when we borrowed million to acquire riley medical in may  we subsequently entered into an interest rate swap agreement to economically hedge the million of debt at a fixed payment obligation of per annum for the period commencing on july  and ending on june  foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of the acquisitions  we have significant operations in the united kingdom 
consequently  a significant portion of our operating results are generated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the pound sterling and euro 
our operating results are therefore impacted by exchange rate fluctuations to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in such currencies with costs incurred in such currencies 
as a global company with operations in the united kingdom  france  switzerland  ireland and malaysia  we experienced an impact from foreign exchange in fiscal as a result of the fluctuation in rates  our revenue increased for the fourth quarter by million and for the total year by million 
the fluctuation in rates increased our gross margin for the fourth quarter by million and for the total year by million 
the impact of rates increased our net loss by million in the fourth quarter and for the total year by million 
we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in foreign currency on the statement of operations 
the loss of the foreign currency valuation of million for offset net foreign currency transaction gains included within the other expense of million 
as of december   we had three contracts for the sale of million of british pounds each and one contract is for the sale of million with settlement dates no later than january   january  and april   for each of the three contracts  respectively 
two contracts each for million expired in january our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are pound sterling us dollar and euro us dollar 
at december   the potential reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be approximately million  net of tax 
this foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all of the foreign currencies to which we are exposed would simultaneously decrease by because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium  stainless steel  cobalt chrome and aluminum 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact product costs 
because we typically do not set prices for our products in advance of our commodity purchases  we can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
however  to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be affected 
a hypothetical instantaneous change in commodity prices would have an immaterial impact on our results of operations in fiscal
