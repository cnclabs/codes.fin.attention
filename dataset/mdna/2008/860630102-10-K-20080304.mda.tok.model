while the us and global equity markets have made gains  concerns over inflation  recession  energy costs  and geopolitical issues have become increasingly pressing 
specifically  the challenges presented by the global credit slowdown  the us sub prime mortgage market  a declining residential real estate market in the us  and the disruption in the auction rate securities market contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward

although the company does not engage in any significant proprietary trading for its own account  inventory of securities held to facilitate customer trades and its market making activities are sensitive to market movements 
the company does not have any significant direct exposure to the sub prime market crisis  but is subject to market fluctuations resulting from news and corporate events in the sub prime mortgage markets  associated write downs by other financial services firms and interest rate fluctuations

additionally  the mjsk and ryan beck acquisitions contributed net margin interest revenues of approximately million and increased asset management and service fees of approximately million 
the company incurred increased employee compensation and benefits costs due to increased staffing for the added volume of transactions related to ryan beck and the amortization of employee loans and restricted stock units issued in the establishment of the ryan beck retention program

there were no troubled debt restructurings during the year ended december  stifel bank trust did not recognize any gains or losses associated with mortgages sold during the year 
the company regularly reviews the loan portfolio and has established an allowance for loan losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
in providing for the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements 
in addition  impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans and a specific allowance established for individual loans determined to be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
impairment is measured using the present value of the impaired loan s expected cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collectible 
factors considered in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
the company determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  usually when principal or interest becomes days past due or when collection becomes uncertain  the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued non accrual status  and any accrued and unpaid interest income is written off 
loans placed on non accrual status are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments are collected and the collectibility of future principal and interest payments is reasonably assured 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes

the following critical accounting policies and estimates are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
stifel financial corp 
and subsidiaries legal loss allowances the company records loss allowances related to legal proceedings resulting from lawsuits and arbitrations  which arise from its business activities 
some of these lawsuits and arbitrations claim substantial amounts  including punitive damage claims 
management has determined that it is likely that the ultimate resolution of certain of these claims will result in losses to the company 
the company has  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimant plaintiff  the merits of the claim  the amount of loss in the client s account  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of the employee of the company  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve 
after discussion with counsel  management  based on its understanding of the facts  accrues what they consider appropriate to provide loss allowances for certain claims  which is included in the consolidated statements of financial condition under the caption accounts payable and accrued expenses 
allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees the company offers transition pay  principally in the form of upfront loans  to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers as part of the company s overall growth strategy 
these loans are generally forgiven over a five to ten year period if the individual satisfies certain conditions  usually based on continued employment and certain performance standards 
if the individual leaves before the term of the loan expires or fails to meet certain performance standards  the individual is required to repay the balance 
in determining the allowance for doubtful receivables from former employees  management considers the facts and circumstances surrounding each receivable  including the amount of the unforgiven balance  the reasons for the terminated employment relationship  and the former employees overall financial positions 
the loan balance from former employees at december  and was million and million  respectively  with associated loss allowances of  and  respectively 
allowance for loan losses the company regularly reviews the bank loan portfolio of stifel bank trust and has established an allowance for loan losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
in providing for the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements 
in addition  impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans and a specific allowance established for individual loans determined to be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
impairment is measured using the present value of the impaired loan s expected cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
stifel financial corp 
and subsidiaries a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collectible 
factors considered in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
the company determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
once a loan is determined to be impaired  usually when principal or interest becomes days past due or when collection becomes uncertain  the accrual of interest and amortization of deferred loan origination fees is discontinued non accrual status  and any accrued and unpaid interest income is written off 
loans placed on non accrual status are returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest payments are collected and the collectibility of future principal and interest payments is reasonably assured 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
valuation of securities and investments securities for which there is no market or dealer price available are held for investment by the parent and certain subsidiaries and included under the caption investments 
these investments of million and million at december  and  respectively  consist primarily of investments in private equity partnerships  start up companies and other venture capital investments  and are carried at fair value based upon management s estimates 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term and the differences could be material 
income tax matters the provision for income taxes and related tax reserves is based on management s consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies for multiple taxing authorities 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the taxing authorities and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to the company s tax return filings 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are results of tax audits  historical experience  and consultation with tax attorneys and other experts 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas statement no 
fin clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribed recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provided guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note s of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on income taxes 
stifel financial corp 
and subsidiaries goodwill and intangible assets the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates 
at december  the company had goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
the company is required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable 
if the impairment tests indicate that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value then an impairment loss would be required to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external and internal factors 
factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  economic trends and market conditions  changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies  unanticipated competition  discount rates  technology  or government regulations 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
in addition to discounted cash flows  we consider other information such as public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
the company has elected to perform its annual impairment test as of july the results of the impairment tests performed at that date did not indicate any impairment 
we believe the assumptions used in performing our impairment tests are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could potentially affect the results of our impairment analysis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to the company s soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment  and knowledge of financial products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring  and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in its business activities are market interest rates and equity prices  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments owned by the company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices is referred to as market risk 
market risk is inherent to financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management procedures includes all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
the company trades tax exempt and taxable debt obligations  including us treasury bills  notes  and bonds  us government agency and municipal notes and bonds  bank certificates of deposit  mortgage backed securities  and corporate obligations 
the company is also an active market maker in over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  the company may maintain inventories in order to ensure availability and to facilitate customer transactions 
changes in value of the company s financial instruments may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings  equity prices  and the correlation among these factors  along with the level of volatility 
the company manages its trading businesses by product and has established trading departments that have responsibility for each product

additionally  the company monitors  on a daily basis  the value at risk var in its institutional fixed income capital markets trading portfolios using daily market data for the previous twelve months and reports var at a confidence level 
var is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility 
this model assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes  and trading losses on any given day could exceed the reported var by significant amounts in unusual volatile markets 
further  the model involves a number of assumptions and inputs 
while management believes that the assumptions and inputs it uses in its risk model are reasonable  different assumptions and inputs could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table sets forth the high  low  and daily average var for the company s institutional fixed income capital markets trading portfolios during the twelve months ended december  and the daily var at december  and twelve months ended december  var calculation at s in thousands high low daily average december  december  daily var related portfolio value var as a percent of portfolio value stifel bank trust s interest rate risk is principally associated with changes in market interest rates related to residential  consumer  and commercial lending activities  as well as fdic insured deposit accounts to customers of the company s broker dealer subsidiaries and to the general public
