item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of dna and rna based drug candidates targeted to toll like receptors  or tlrs  to treat infectious diseases  autoimmune diseases  cancer  and asthma and allergies  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
drug candidates are compounds that we are developing and have not been approved for any commercial use 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells that recognize the dna or rna of pathogens such as bacteria or viruses and initiate an immune response 
relying on our expertise in dna and rna chemistry  we have designed and created proprietary tlr agonists and antagonists to modulate immune responses 
a tlr agonist is a compound that stimulates an immune response through the targeted tlr 
a tlr antagonist is a compound that blocks activation of an immune response through the targeted tlr 

table of contents we are focused on developing tlr targeted compounds for the potential treatment of infectious diseases  autoimmune diseases  cancer 
imo  a tlr agonist  is our lead drug candidate for infectious diseases and is in a phase clinical trial in patients with chronic hepatitis c virus infection who have not responded to current standard of care therapy 
we are also evaluating rna based compounds that act as agonists of tlr and tlr in our infectious disease program 
in our autoimmune disease program we have identified dna based compounds that act as antagonists of tlr and tlr our cancer treatment research program is focused on evaluation of our agonists of tlr and tlr we are also collaborating with three pharmaceutical companies to advance our tlr targeted compounds in multiple disease areas 
we are collaborating with merck kgaa for cancer treatment excluding cancer vaccines  with merck co 
for vaccine adjuvants  and with novartis  for treatment of asthma and allergies 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant funds until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our products  we need to address a number of technological challenges and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
in  we expect that our research and development expenses will be higher than our research and development expenses in as we expand our imo development program and accelerate our early stage programs on tlr anatagonists and on agonists of tlr and tlr critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and ii the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition and stock based compensation fit the description of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  that requires four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  services have been rendered or obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of the last three criteria are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered or products delivered and the collectibility of these fees 
should changes in 
table of contents conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for any future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  the company considers whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize license fees and other upfront fees  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of our contractual obligation or our estimated continuing involvement under the research arrangement 
we recognize service and research and development revenue when the services are performed 
for payments that are specifically associated with a separate earnings process  we recognize revenue when the specific performance obligation is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  on january  this statement requires us to recognize all share based payments to employees as expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to record compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we are also required to record compensation cost for the non vested portion of previously granted stock based awards outstanding at the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
adjusted for forfeitures as required by sfas r 
as permitted under sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values  including average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life and expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the assumed expected option life is based on the average of the option term and the option vesting period for standard options which meet the sec s staff accounting bulletin criteria for utilizing this simplified method and based on actual experience of options held by employees holding options with similar characteristics for those options that do not meet the sec s criteria for using the simplified method 
the expected volatility assumption is based on the actual stock price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option 
we elected to adopt sfas no 
r on a modified prospective basis 
as a result  the financial statements for periods prior to january   do not include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method 
prior to january   we applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore  recorded the intrinsic value of stock based compensation as an expense 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenue in primarily reflects a full year of license fee revenue and research reimbursements recognized under our collaboration agreement with merck co  which we entered into in december in december  we received a million upfront payment under our collaboration agreement with merck co 
we are recognizing the million upfront payment over the potential research term under the agreement 
of this million  we recognized million as revenue in in  we also recognized million in revenue from research reimbursements under our collaboration agreement with merck co 
and million in milestone revenue from another collaboration agreement 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with novartis signed in may in february  novartis elected to extend our research collaboration with them 
as a result of such extension  novartis paid us an additional million in may we are amortizing the million upfront payment received from novartis in july and the extension payment over the expected research term with million recognized as revenue in as compared to million in we did not recognize any revenue in under our collaboration with merck kgaa  which became effective on february  the decrease in revenue in from primarily reflects the inclusion in of revenues related to a reimbursement of third party expenses in under our collaboration agreement with novartis 
this decrease was partially offset by million representing a full year of license fee revenue recognized in under the same collaboration with novartis and million in license fee revenue recognized in under our collaboration agreement with merck co 
our revenues for  and were comprised of payments under various collaboration and licensing agreements for research and development  including reimbursement of third party expenses  and license fees  sublicense fees  and royalty payments 
we also had revenue in from a milestone reached under one of our collaborations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increases in clinical and non clinical trial costs for imo  discovery employee costs  which are reimbursed  in connection with the merck co 
collaboration  costs associated with hiring additional drug development employees and stock based compensation 
the increase was offset  in part  by lower ind enabling external expenses related to imo and a decrease in imo external development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased costs associated with imo preclinical studies in infectious disease  higher payroll costs  an increase in stock based compensation and costs associated with the formation of our oncology clinical advisory board 
these increased expenses were 
table of contents offset  in part  by third party expenses incurred by us in related to the novartis collaboration  which were not incurred in year ended december  annual percentage change in millions imo external development expense imo external development expense other drug development expense basic discovery expense total research and development expense in the preceding table  research and development expense is set forth in the following four categories imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo  our lead compound being developed for oncology applications 
these external expenses reflect payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development trials and studies conducted after the initiation of imo clinical trials and drug manufacturing and related costs but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead 
since  when we commenced clinical development of imo  we have incurred approximately million in external expenses through december  in connection with imo imo external development expenses decreased by million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to lower clinical trial expenses as we closed enrollment of a phase trial in june and a phase trial in july and to a decrease in nonclinical safety studies of imo these decreases were partially offset by increases associated with additional imo trials that we commenced in the decrease in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to lower phase trial expenses as we approached full enrollment of our phase clinical trial and to a decrease in drug supply expenses as a result of imo manufacture expense recognition during but not during these decreases were partially offset by expenses for a phase clinical trial which we initiated in october  and an increase in additional nonclinical safety studies of imo in december  we initiated a phase b trial of imo in combination with avastin and tarceva in non small cell lung cancer patients whose cancer had progressed during a prior course of standard therapy 
we are currently recruiting patients for this trial  which was designed with a target enrollment of up to patients 
we have agreed with merck kgaa that we will complete the phase renal cell cancer trial and the phase refractory solid tumor chemotherapy trial 
we also have agreed with merck kgaa that we will continue to conduct on its behalf the on going phase b non small cell lung cancer trial and that we may initiate the proposed phase b colorectal cancer trial 
merck kgaa has agreed to reimburse us for costs associated with these two phase b clinical trials that we incur after february   which is the date our agreement with merck kgaa became effective 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo  our lead compound initially being developed for chronic hepatitis c virus infection 
these external expenses reflect payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of the first imo clinical trial but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead 
we commenced clinical development of imo in may and since then we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december  in connection with imo  including costs associated with the initiation of our phase clinical trial and related non clinical studies and manufacturing process development 
in may  we submitted an ind for imo to the fda  and in september  we initiated a phase study of imo in patients with chronic hepatitis c virus infection who have not responded to the current standard of care treatment 
we plan to enroll up to patients in four cohorts at escalating imo dose levels  with four weeks of treatment 
of the ten patients per cohort  eight will be randomized to receive imo treatment and two will be randomized to receive placebo treatment 
the trial is designed to assess the safety of imo at each dose level 
secondary objectives include assessments of the effects of imo on hepatitis c 
table of contents virus rna levels and parameters of immune system activation 
we anticipate interim results from this trial to be available in the first half of other drug development expenses 
these expenses include internal and external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development in addition to internal costs associated with products in clinical development 
the internal and external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
expenses associated with products in clinical development include costs associated with our hepatitis c clinical advisory board  our oncology clinical advisory board  payroll and overhead 
other drug development expenses decreased by million  or  from million in to million in and increased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in was primarily due to decreases in manufacturing and other pre ind direct external expenses related to imo the decrease is computed based on costs incurred only through april since costs incurred after the may submission of the imo ind have been shown separately in the above table 
the decrease in other drug development expenses during was offset  in part  by costs associated with the hiring of additional drug development employees  increased stock based compensation and allocated costs associated with the move to our new facility during the second quarter of the increase in these expenses in was primarily attributable to manufacturing and ind enabling safety study costs associated with imo  costs associated with the formation of our oncology clinical advisory board and an increase in compensation costs attributable to the hiring of additional employees and our adoption of sfas no 
r 
these increases were offset in part by third party expenses incurred by us in related to the novartis collaboration  which were not incurred in we had direct external expenses of approximately million  million  and million related to imo  before we commenced clinical development  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to the continuing discovery and development of our tlr targeted programs  including agonists and antagonists of tlrs  and these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
basic discovery expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll expenses relating to work under our merck co 
collaboration  an increase in expenses for laboratory supplies and allocated costs associated with the move to our new facility during the second quarter of the decrease in these expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in external research as some of our collaborative agreements with academic institutions were completed 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease in compensation expense as a result of allocating more executive compensation to other departments  offset partially by an increase in compensation costs attributable  in part  to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in allocation of overhead costs as a result of higher facility expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing imo or any other drug candidate from our research and development programs 
at this time  without knowing the results of our ongoing clinical trials of imo and without an established plan for future clinical tests of imo or other drug candidates  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  imo or any other drug candidate from our research and development programs 
moreover  the clinical development of imo or any other drug candidate from our research and development programs is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the time required to enroll suitable subjects  
table of contents the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated with our patent applications and maintenance  our regulatory filing requirements  and business development 
the million increase from to primarily reflects increased employee costs  higher stock based compensation expense for employees and consultants  higher professional fees associated with marketing research and legal services including legal expenses in connection with the merck kgaa collaboration signed in december  implementation of sarbanes oxley section requirements  costs associated with the move to our new facility and costs accrued in anticipation of payments to be made to our former chief financial officer under the transition agreement entered into with him in may the million increase from to primarily reflects an increase in compensation expenses associated with the addition of employees in  higher compensation levels in  and higher stock compensation expenses resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the increase also reflects higher consulting and legal expenses as a result of the merck co 
collaboration signed in december these increases were partially offset by lower patent preparation costs resulting from a consolidation of our patent portfolio and greater efficiencies in maintaining our patents 
investment income  net investment income increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in is primarily attributable to higher cash and investment balances 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in and the increase in is due to the inclusion in of a full year of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our convertible notes we issued in may in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
the convertible notes were converted into shares of our common stock in february the decrease in is partially offset by interest expense associated with our note payable 
income tax expense in  we recorded approximately  as income tax expense as a result of income subject to the alternative minimum tax 
we did not have income subject to the alternative minimum tax for the years ended or net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the factors discussed above  our net loss applicable to common stockholders amounted to million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we have incurred losses of million since january  we have incurred net losses of million prior to december  during which time we were involved in the development of antisense technology 
since our inception  we had an accumulated deficit of million through december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 

table of contents net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million available to reduce federal and state taxable income which expire through and  respectively 
in addition  we had cumulative federal and state tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce federal and state income taxes  which expire through and  respectively 
the tax reform act of contains provisions  which limit the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that companies may utilize in any one year in the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three year period in excess of 
we have completed several financings since the effective date of the tax reform act of  which as of december   have resulted in ownership changes in excess of  as defined under the act and that may significantly limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have not prepared an analysis to determine the effect of the ownership change limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
ownership changes in future periods may place additional limits on our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures and to pay debt service 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following equity and debt financing  license fees and research funding under collaborative and license agreements  interest income  and lease financings 
in january  we sent notice to holders of our warrants to purchase common stock that were issued in august with an expiration date of august   or the august warrants  that under the terms of the warrant agreement  we intend to redeem on march  any august warrants not exercised as of that date for a redemption price of per share of common stock underlying the august warrants 
the august warrants can be exercised by cash payment only and have an exercise price of per share of common stock 
following such notice and through february   we have received approximately  in proceeds from the exercise of august warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
as of february   august warrants to purchase  shares of common stock remained outstanding 
in december  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with merck kgaa to research  develop and commercialize products containing our tlr agonists for the treatment of cancer  excluding cancer vaccines 
under the terms of the agreement  in february merck kgaa paid us a million upfront license fee in euros of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates 
in june  we executed a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of million in favor of general electric capital corporation 
the promissory note was secured by specific laboratory  manufacturing  office and computer equipment and was subject to the terms of a master security agreement between us and ge 
the promissory note bore interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and was payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and accrued interest  with the first installment having been paid out of the proceeds of the borrowing 
in march  we paid approximately million to ge as payment in full of all obligations outstanding under our promissory note with ge 
the payment represented approximately million of prinicipal amount outstanding plus accrued interest through the date of payment and a prepayment premium of approximately million 
the note has been cancelled 
in december  we entered into an exclusive license and research collaboration agreement with merck co 
to research  develop  and commercialize vaccine products containing our tlr  and agonists in the fields of cancer  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
under the terms of the agreement  merck co 
paid us a million license fee in december in addition  in connection with the execution of the license and 
table of contents collaboration agreement  we issued and sold to merck co 
 shares of our common stock for a price of per share resulting in an aggregate purchase price of million 
in march  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from a private placement to institutional investors 
in the private placement  we sold for a purchase price of per share  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  are fully exercisable and will expire if not exercised on or prior to september  the warrants may be exercised by cash payment only 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  excluding the proceeds of any future exercise of the warrants  totaled approximately million 
in march  we secured a purchase commitment from an investor to purchase from us up to million of our common stock during the period from june  through december  in up to three drawdowns made by us at our discretion 
prior to december   we drew down the full million through the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to us  excluding the proceeds of any future exercise of the warrants  described below  of approximately million 
the agent fees and other costs directly related to securing the commitment amounted to approximately million 
as part of the arrangement  we issued warrants to the investor to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable by cash payment only 
the warrants are exercisable at any time on or prior to september  on or after march   we may redeem the warrants for per warrant share following notice to the warrant holders if the closing sales price of the common stock exceeds of the warrant exercise price for consecutive trading days prior to the notice 
we may exercise our right to redeem the warrants by providing at least days prior written notice to the holders of the warrants 
in may  we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement and a license  development and commercialization agreement with novartis to discover  develop and potentially commercialize immune modulatory oligonucleotides that are tlr agonists and that are identified as potential treatments for asthma and allergies 
under the terms of the agreements  novartis paid us a million license fee in july in february  novartis elected to extend the research phase of the collaboration by one year until may and  in connection with the extension  paid us million in in may  we issued approximately million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due april  to overseas investors 
interest on the convertible subordinated notes was payable in arrears on december  for the period from issuance to that date  and thereafter semi annually on april and october and at maturity or upon conversion 
we had the option to pay interest on the convertible subordinated notes in cash or in shares of common stock at the then current market value of the common stock 
in  we issued  shares of common stock in payment of interest on the convertible subordinated notes 
all other interest payments have been paid in cash 
the net proceeds from the offering totaled approximately million 
in february  we elected to automatically convert the convertible subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million into  shares of our common stock effective on february  we were entitled to exercise the right of automatic conversion because the volume weighted average of the closing prices of the our common stock for a period of ten consecutive trading days exceeded  which represented of the conversion price of the notes 
cash flows as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and investments  a net decrease of approximately million from december  we used million of cash from operating activities during the million primarily reflects our million net loss for  as adjusted for non cash revenue and expenses  including stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization 
it also reflects the changes in deferred revenue associated with revenue recognition under our collaborative arrangements and changes in our accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the net cash provided by investing activities during of million reflects our purchase of approximately million in securities offset by our sale of million of securities and the proceeds of 
table of contents approximately million from securities that matured in the net cash used in investing activities also reflects million investment in laboratory  office and computer equipment 
the net cash provided by financing activities during of million  reflects the net proceeds from the issuance of a million promissory note and the million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants during funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  we believe that based on our current operating plan our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  including the million upfront payment that we received in february under our agreement with merck kgaa  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december  we may incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
to date  almost all of our revenues have been from collaborative and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available  or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 
should we be unable to raise sufficient funds in the future  we may be required to significantly curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis  or at all  in the future 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the success of our existing strategic collaborations with merck kgaa  merck co 
and novartis  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our discovery or development programs
