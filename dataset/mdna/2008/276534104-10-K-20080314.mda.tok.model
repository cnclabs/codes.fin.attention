table of contents principal revenue and expense items the company derives its revenue primarily from net premiums earned  including assumed premiums earned  net investment income and net realized investment gains 
direct and net premiums written 
direct premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance 
direct premiums written include all premiums billed during a specified policy period 
net premiums written is the difference between direct premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers ceded premiums written 
in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment  assumed premiums are derived from insurance contracts written by the company and ceded to the segregated portfolio cells 
in the specialty reinsurance segment  assumed premiums are premiums that are received from a third party under a reinsurance agreement  which are reported to the company directly from the broker one quarter in arrears 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned are the earned portion of the company s net premiums written 
premiums are earned over the term of the related policies 
at the end of each accounting period  the portion of the premiums that are not yet earned are included in unearned premiums and are realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
the company s workers compensation policies typically have a term of twelve months 
thus  for example  for a policy that is written on july   one half of the premiums would be earned in and the other half would be earned in workers compensation premiums are determined based upon the payroll of the insured  the applicable premium rates and  where applicable  an experience based modification factor 
an audit of the policyholders records is conducted after policy expiration  to make a final determination of applicable premiums 
included with net premiums earned is an estimate for earned but unbilled final audit premiums 
the company can estimate earned but unbilled premiums because it keeps track  by policy  of how much additional premium is billed in final audit invoices as a percentage to estimate the probable additional amount that it has earned but not yet billed as of the balance sheet date 
the majority of the company s group benefits insurance policies are billed on a monthly basis with premiums being earned in the month in which coverage is provided 
as a result  there is minimal unearned premium related to the group benefits insurance policies as of the balance sheet date 
net investment income and realized gains and losses on investments 
the company invests its surplus and the funds supporting its insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and lae in cash  cash equivalents  fixed income securities  convertible bonds  equity securities  and other long term investments 
investment income includes interest earned on invested assets and the change in equity interest of limited partnerships included in other long term investments 
realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income 
the company recognizes realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their cost or amortized cost in the case of fixed income securities and recognizes realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their cost or amortized cost 
realized gains and losses also include the change in fair value of convertible bonds 
other revenue 
other revenue includes claim administration  risk management  and cell rental fees earned 
there are other revenue items that the company recognizes on a segmental basis that are eliminated in consolidation 
such items consist primarily of fees paid by the segregated portfolio cells to other entities within the consolidated group 
the segregated portfolio cells recognize an expense for such items included as part of its ceding commission and a corresponding revenue item is recognized by the affiliate providing the service 
for segment reporting purposes  such revenue items primarily include claims administration  risk management  and cell rental fees 
fronting fees are included in acquisition and other underwriting expenses as an offset to the direct costs incurred 
for segment reporting purposes  such fees are recognized ratably over the period in which the service is provided  which generally corresponds to the earned portion of net premiums written for the underlying policies 
the company s expenses consist primarily of losses and lae  acquisition and other underwriting expenses  policyholder dividends  other expenses  and income taxes 
losses and lae 
losses and lae represent the largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for prior periods  and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
acquisition and other underwriting expenses 
in the workers compensation and group benefits insurance segments  expenses incurred to underwrite risks are referred to as acquisition and other underwriting expenses  which consist primarily of commissions  premium taxes and fees and other underwriting expenses incurred in acquiring  writing and administering 
table of contents the company s business as well as required payments to the security fund 
there were no security fund assessments incurred by the company in or in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance and specialty reinsurance segments  acquisition and other underwriting expenses consist of ceding commissions earned under the respective reinsurance agreements 
ceding commissions received are netted against acquisition and other underwriting expenses 
other expenses 
other expenses consist of general administrative expenses such as salaries  rent  office supplies  depreciation and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately 
other expenses also include interest expense related primarily to the company s junior subordinated debt 
policyholder dividend expense 
policyholder dividends represent the amount of dividends incurred during the period that are expected to be returned to policyholders 
the dividend expense is based on the loss experience of the underlying workers compensation insurance policy 
income tax expense 
eihi and certain of its subsidiaries pay federal  state and local income taxes 
income tax expense includes an amount for both current and deferred income taxes 
current income tax expense includes an amount for the company s current year federal income tax liability and any adjustments related to differences between the prior year federal income tax estimate and the actual income tax expense reported in the federal income tax return 
deferred tax expense represents the change in the company s net deferred tax asset  exclusive of the tax effect related to changes in unrealized gains and losses in the company s investment portfolio and changes in the unrecognized amounts related to the company s benefit plan liabilities 
key financial measures the company evaluates its insurance operations by monitoring certain key measures of growth and profitability 
the company measures growth by monitoring changes in direct premiums written and net premiums written 
the company measures underwriting profitability by examining loss  expense and combined ratios 
on a segmental basis  the company measures a segment s operating results by examining net income  diluted earnings per share  and return on average equity 
loss ratio 
the loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned and measures the underwriting profitability of a company s insurance business 
the company measures the loss ratio on an accident year and calendar year loss basis to measure underwriting profitability 
an accident year loss ratio measures losses and lae for insured events occurring in a particular year  regardless of when they are reported  as a percentage of net premiums earned during that year 
a calendar year loss ratio measures losses and lae for insured events occurring during a particular year and the change in loss reserves from prior accident years as a percentage of net premiums earned during that year 
expense ratio 
the expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of the sum of the acquisition and other underwriting expenses and other expenses to net premiums earned  and measures the company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
policyholder dividend expense ratio 
the policyholder dividend expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of policyholder dividend expense to net premiums earned and measures the impact of the company s policyholder dividend policies on its workers compensation insurance segment 
combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio  expense ratio and policyholder dividend expense ratio and measures the company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is below  the company is making an underwriting profit 
if the company s combined ratio is at or above  the company is not profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio 
the net premiums written to statutory surplus ratio represents the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
this ratio measures the company s insurance subsidiaries exposure to pricing errors in its current book of business 
the higher the ratio  the greater the impact on surplus should pricing prove inadequate 
net income  diluted earnings per share  and return on average equity 
the company uses net income and diluted earnings per share to measure its profits and return on average equity to measure its effectiveness in utilizing shareholders equity to generate net income 
in determining return on average equity for a given year  net income is divided by the average of the beginning and ending shareholders equity for that year 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies 
the company is required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to the estimates and assumptions and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the company believes the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae the company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and lae for its workers compensation  segregated portfolio cell reinsurance  group benefits insurance  and specialty reinsurance products  which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses 
the adequacy of the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount that the company may pay under many of the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years 
establishing reserves is an imprecise process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
the company s estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data becomes available and are reviewed as new or improved methodologies are developed  or as current laws change 
any such revisions could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverables and would be reflected in the company s results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed 
estimating the ultimate claims liability is necessarily a complex and judgmental process inasmuch as the amounts are based on management s informed estimates and judgments using data currently available 
if the company s ultimate losses  net of reinsurance  prove to differ substantially from the amounts recorded as of december   the related adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
workers compensation insurance on a quarterly basis  the company prepares actuarial analyses to assess the reasonableness of the recorded reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its workers compensation insurance segment 
these actuarial analyses incorporate various methodologies  including paid loss development  incurred loss development and a combination of other actuarial methodologies that incorporate characteristics of incurred and paid methodologies combined with a review of the company s exposure base 
the recorded amount in each accident year is then compared to the results of these methodologies  with consideration being given to the age of the accident year 
as accident years mature  the various methodologies generally produce consistent loss estimates 
for more recent accident years  the methodologies produce results that are not as consistent 
accordingly  more emphasis is placed on supplementing the methodologies in more recent accident years with trends in exposure base  medical expense inflation  general inflation  severity  and claim counts  among other things 
the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its workers compensation insurance segment as of december  and are summarized below in thousands case reserves case incurred development  ibnr and unallocated lae reserves amount of discount net reserves before reinsurance recoverables and purchase accounting reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae purchase accounting adjustments reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its workers compensation segment  the company records reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies and for lae related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae represent the estimated cost of reported and unreported losses and lae incurred and unpaid at a given point in time 
in establishing its workers compensation reserves  the company uses loss discounting  which involves recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 

table of contents when a claim is reported  the company s claims adjusters establish a case reserve  which consists of anticipated medical costs  indemnity costs and certain defense and cost containment expenses that the company refers to as allocated loss adjustment expenses  or alae 
at any point in time  the amount paid on a claim  plus the case reserve for future amounts to be paid  represents the claims adjuster s estimate at that time of the total cost of the claim  or the case incurred amount 
the case reserve for each reported claim is based upon various factors  including type of loss  severity of the injury or damage  age and occupation of the injured employee  estimated length of temporary disability  anticipated permanent disability  expected medical procedures  costs and duration  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim  insurance policy provisions  including coverage  related to the claim  jurisdiction of the occurrence  and other benefits defined by applicable statute 
the case incurred amount can vary over time due to changes in expectations with respect to medical treatment and outcome  length and degree of disability  employment availability and wage levels and judicial determinations 
as changes occur  the case incurred amount is adjusted 
the initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid  especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment 
changes in case incurred amounts  or case incurred development  is an important component of the company s historical claim data 
in addition to case reserves  the company establishes loss and alae reserves on an aggregate basis for case incurred development and ibnr claims 
case incurred development and ibnr reserves are primarily intended to provide for aggregate changes in preexisting case incurred amounts and  secondarily  as the unpaid cost of ibnr claims for which an initial case reserve has not been established 
the third component of the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae is unallocated loss adjustment expense  or ulae 
the company s ulae reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for known and unknown claims 
the company s ulae reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims 
in estimating case incurred development and ibnr reserves  the company performs most of its detailed analysis on a net of reinsurance basis  and then considers expected recoveries in arriving at its recorded amounts for unpaid losses and lae 
to estimate such reserves  the company relies primarily on the analysis of claims in its year workers compensation insurance history 
using standard actuarial methods  the company estimates reserves based on historical patterns of case development  payment patterns  mix of business  premium rates charged  case reserving adequacy  operational changes  adjustment philosophy and severity and duration trends 
however  the number of variables and judgments involved in establishing reserve estimates  combined with some random variation in loss development patterns  results in uncertainty regarding projected ultimate losses 
to estimate reserves  the company stratifies its data using variations of the following different categorizations of claims all loss and lae data developed together  lost time claims developed independently  medical only claims developed independently  the indemnity portion of lost time claims developed independently  the medical portion of a lost time claim and medical only claims developed together  and lae developed independently 

table of contents the term developed together refers to the summation of the claims data for a particular data stratification 
for example  all loss and lae data developed together represents all loss and lae data of the company  regardless of medical  indemnity or expense components  developed together using the historical data for this particular data stratification 
the term developed independently refers to a specific data element 
for example  the indemnity portion of lost time claims developed independently represents the development of the indemnity portion of a claim separately using historical data for this particular type of claim 
developing claims using different data stratifications allows the company to identify trends for a specific group of claims that would not necessarily be readily identifiable if the data were included with other types of claim information 
for example  developing the medical portion of a claim separately may allow the company to identify a medical inflation trend that may not have been evident if it had been included with indemnity claim information 
the combination of the different data stratifications and standard actuarial methods  including the following  produce different actuarial indications for the company to evaluate incurred loss development method 
the incurred case incurred loss development method relies on the assumption that  at any given state of maturity  ultimate losses can be predicted by multiplying cumulative reported losses paid losses plus case reserves by a cumulative development factor 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates  as well as the consistency of case reserve levels 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at all stages of maturity 
age to age loss development factors ldfs are calculated to measure the relative development of an accident year from one maturity point to the next 
paid loss development method 
the paid loss development method is mechanically identical to the incurred loss development method described above 
the paid method does not rely on case reserves or claim reporting patterns in making projections 
the validity of the results from using a paid loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  legal changes or variations in a company s mix of business from one year to the next 
also  since the percentage of losses paid for immature years is often low  development factors are more volatile 
a small variation in the number of claims paid can have a leveraging effect that can lead to significant changes in estimated ultimate liability for losses and lae 
therefore  ultimate values for immature accident years are often based on alternative estimation techniques 
bornhuetter ferguson methodology 
the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on reported loss data relies on the assumption that remaining unreported losses are a function of the total expected ultimate losses rather than a function of the currently reported losses 
the expected ultimate losses in this analysis are based on historical results  adjusted for known pricing changes and inflationary trends 
the expected ultimate losses are multiplied by the unreported percentage to produce expected unreported losses 
the unreported percentage is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the selected cumulative incurred ldfs 
finally  the unreported losses are added to the current reported losses to produce ultimate losses 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is most useful as an alternative to other models for immature accident years 
for these immature accident years  the amounts reported or paid may be small and unstable and therefore not predictive of future development 
therefore  future development is assumed to follow an expected pattern that is supported by more stable historical data or by emerging trends 
this method is also useful when changing reporting patterns distort historical development of losses 
the bornhuetter ferguson method can also be applied with paid losses 
in estimating ulae reserves  the company reviews past loss adjustment expenses in relation to paid claims and estimated future costs based on expected claims activity and duration 
the sum of the company s net loss and alae reserve  and ulae reserves represents its total net reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
in determining management s best estimate  the company considers the various accident year loss indications produced by the actuarial methods 
considering the results of the methods  the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each method as described above  as well as other statistical information such as ultimate loss ratios  ultimate loss to exposure ratios and average ultimate claim values  the company determines and records its best estimate of unpaid losses and alae 
management believes its best estimate of recorded reserves for unpaid losses and lae is representative of the inherent uncertainty surrounding reserving for a long tail line of business such as workers compensation as well as the relative immature accident year historical experience of its workers compensation insurance segment  which completed its first full year of operations in as of december   the company s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers and before purchase accounting adjustments  for its workers compensation insurance segment was million 
this amount was determined based on methods which were viewed to be better predictors than other methods 

table of contents given the long reporting and paid development patterns  the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by the company s workers compensation policies require considerable judgment 
management believes that its selected tail factors represent the most likely loss development based on historical loss payment patterns as well as the current legal and economic environment 
the actual tail factor could vary from the tail factor selected 
following is a sensitivity analysis of the company s workers compensation reserves to reasonably likely changes in the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses dollars in thousands change in tail factor assumption increase decrease in net reserves impact on net income percentage of shareholders equity basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease basis point decrease the estimates above rely on substantial judgment 
there is inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
it is possible that the actual losses and lae incurred may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
segregated portfolio cell reinsurance the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment as of december  and are summarized below in thousands case reserves case incurred development  ibnr and unallocated lae reserves amount of discount net reserves before reinsurance recoverables and purchase accounting reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae purchase accounting adjustments reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the company estimates and records reserves for its segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment in the same manner as for its workers compensation insurance segment 
the reporting and paid loss development patterns in the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment are also consistent with that of the workers compensation insurance segment 
accordingly  the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered in the company s segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment require considerable judgment 
the difference between total revenue for the segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment for each period and the sum of losses and lae  underwriting expenses  policyholder dividend expenses and other expenses is accrued as a segregated portfolio dividend expense 
accordingly  any change in the reserve for unpaid losses and lae is recorded to the segregated portfolio dividend payable receivable account and would only impact the company s net income or shareholders equity if it were a segregated portfolio cell dividend participant 
group benefits the reserves for unpaid losses and lae includes an estimate of future amounts for reported but unpaid and ibnr claims related to the company s dental  long term disability  short term disability and term life products  as well as an estimate of the costs associated with investigating  processing and paying the related claims 
the company utilizes a number of methodologies  explained below  to estimate its reserves for unpaid losses in its group benefits insurance segment 
these methods include the lag factor development  loss ratio  and tabular reserve methods 
lag factor development method 
the lag factor development method is used to estimate the reserve for insurance products that are short tail by nature  in which claims related to the products are settled shortly after they are reported by the insured 
the method uses historical paid claims data to estimate the reserve for claims in the course of settlement reported claims and ibnr claims 
the method involves the use of a claim model  or a loss triangle  in which paid claims 
table of contents data is aggregated into categories based on the dates on which the claims in question were incurred and paid 
data in the loss triangle is reviewed to evaluate historical claim payment patterns 
a point estimate is then determined based on the historical claim payment patterns 
loss ratio method 
the loss ratio method involves the use of historical loss ratios to estimate the reserve for unpaid claims 
under the loss ratio method  the reserve is determined by multiplying the selected loss ratio  which is based on historical loss ratio trends  by the amount of net earned premium or the in force premium at the valuation date 
tabular reserve method 
the tabular reserve method is used to estimate the reserve for insurance products that are longer tail by nature and for which the claim payment patterns are relatively predictable 
under the tabular reserve method  the reserve for reported but unpaid claims is estimated using industry standard valuation tables 
these tables incorporate expected death and recovery rate assumptions based on an insured s age and length of disability that impact the reserve for unpaid claims 
the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its group benefits insurance segment  by line business  as of december  and  were as follows in thousands dental short term disability long term disability term life other net reserves for unpaid losses and lae reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and lae reserves for unpaid losses and lae dental reserves the dental reserves represent the company s estimate of future amounts due on in process and ibnr dental claims 
the company estimates its dental reserves using a combination of the lag factor development method and the loss ratio method  which results in the development of a point estimate 
the loss ratio method is generally applied to the last three months or most recent quarter  based on recent loss ratio trends 
due to the small size of the company s dental block of business  the recorded dental reserve represents the point estimate plus an amount for adverse development equal to of the point estimate 
short term disability reserves the short term disability reserves represent the company s estimate of future amounts due on in process and ibnr short term disability claims 
the company s methodology for estimating its short term disability reserves is consistent with the methodology for estimating dental reserves 
long term disability reserves the long term disability tabular reserve represents the company s estimate of future amounts due on reported long term disability claims 
the company establishes a reserve at the time a long term disability claim is reported using the commissioners group disability table 
due to the long term nature of long term disability claims  management discounts the liability using an interest rate that reflects the estimated investment return in the company s group benefits insurance segment that will be earned over the expected life of the claim 
in establishing the discount rate  the company s management evaluates the current interest rate environment at the end of each year and  if necessary  adjusts the interest rate for the following year based on the expected rate of return on new investments 
the discount rates for claims incurred in  and were   and  respectively 
a lower discount rate results in a higher claim reserve and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses  whereas a higher discount rate results in a lower claim reserve and a decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the reserve established represents the present value of expected future claim payments based on the terms of the underlying long term disability insurance contract 
with the exception of the discount rate  the assumptions that impact the reserve amount  such as recovery  morbidity and mortality rates  are embedded in the table 
the long term disability ibnr reserve is estimated on a policy by policy basis  taking into consideration the average monthly premium  the policy elimination period  and an expected loss ratio 

table of contents term life reserves term life reserves consist of reported but unpaid and ibnr claims on the company s term life product  as well as a life premium waiver reserve 
reported but unpaid life claims represent those claims reported to the company as of the balance sheet date for which payment has not yet been made 
term life ibnr claims are estimated based on historical patterns of losses incurred as a percent of in force premium as of the balance sheet date 
the term life reported claim reserve represents the company s liability for reported but unpaid death benefits and accidental death or dismemberment ad d claims 
the reserve is based on the death or dismemberment benefit of the underlying term life insurance contract 
the term life ibnr claim reserve represents the company s estimate of future amounts to be paid under existing term life insurance contracts for insured deaths and dismemberments that have occurred but not yet been reported 
the company estimates the term life ibnr claim reserve by applying a reserve factor to the current in force volume of life insurance and ad d benefits  resulting in the development of a point estimate 
the reserve factor is based on past experience and is evaluated against actual results on an annual basis for reasonableness 
life premium waiver reserves represent the present value of future life insurance benefits under those term life policies for which the premiums have been waived due to the insured s disability and are calculated using the tabular reserve method 
the company establishes a reserve at the time the insured s disability is reported using the group term life waiver reserve table for claims reported on and after october  and the intercompany group life disability table for claims reported prior to october  the term life premium waiver ibnr reserve represents the company s estimate of unreported premium waiver claims 
the company utilizes the lag factor development method to estimate the number of unreported premium waiver claims and then applies the number of estimated outstanding claims to an average reserve amount  resulting in the development of a point estimate 
specialty reinsurance with respect to the specialty reinsurance segment  numerous internal and external factors will affect the ultimate settlements of future claims including  but not necessarily limited to  changes in the cost of environmental remediation  impacts of relevant federal or state legislation  changes in technology and the resulting impact on costs  and reliance on ceding companies to handle claims and remit proper loss information in a timely manner 
reserving for assumed reinsurance requires evaluating loss information received from the ceding company 
on a quarterly basis  eastern re receives a statement from the ceding company which includes premium and loss settlement activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company 
claims reported to the ceding company by insureds are entered into its claim system and ceded to eastern re on a quarterly basis 
the claim information received from the ceding company is compiled into loss development triangles 
generally accepted actuarial methodologies  supplemented by judgment where appropriate  are used to develop the appropriate ibnr reserves for eastern re 
each quarter the company compares its actual reported losses for the quarter  and cumulative reported losses since the most recently completed reserve study  to expected reported losses for the respective period  which may result in the company increasing its losses and lae  and its corresponding loss reserves in that quarter 
this information is used as a tool in the judgmental process by which management assesses the overall adequacy of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae at eastern re 
the evaluation of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae related to the company s specialty reinsurance programs requires that loss development be estimated over an extended period of time 
because the primary insurer under this program changed in and the claims management philosophy of the two primary insurers differed  historical loss data for years prior to is not very useful 
therefore  reliance has been placed on industry loss development patterns  adjusted to reflect considerations particular to the exposure 
the reliance on external benchmarks  while necessary  creates an additional element of uncertainty 
the company s reserves for unpaid losses and lae in its specialty reinsurance segment as of december  and are summarized below in thousands case reserves case incurred development  ibnr and unallocated lae reserves amount of discount net reserves before purchase accounting purchase accounting adjustments reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
table of contents in its specialty reinsurance segment  the company categorizes unpaid losses and lae into case reserves and ibnr reserves 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the ceding company 
the company updates its reserve estimates on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
the company analyzes its ultimate losses and lae for specialty reinsurance after consideration of the loss experience on each treaty for each underwriting year on a quarterly basis 
the methodologies that the company employs include  but may not be limited to  paid loss development methods and incurred loss development methods similar to those described in the workers compensation insurance and segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segments above 
in applying these methods  the company evaluates loss development trends by underwriting year to determine various assumptions that are required as inputs in the actuarial methodologies it employs 
these typically involve the analysis of historical loss development trends by underwriting year 
in addition  the company utilizes external or internal benchmark sources of information for which it does not have sufficient loss development data to calculate credible trends 
the evaluation of the reserve for unpaid losses and lae related to the specialty reinsurance segment requires that loss development be estimated over an extended period of time 
the company relies on information provided by ceding companies regarding premiums and reported claims  and then uses that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and lae 
since the company relies on claims information reported by ceding companies  the estimation of unpaid losses and lae for specialty reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that do not exist with its other segments  and include  but are not necessarily limited to  the following the reported claims information could be inaccurate  and or could be subject to significant reporting lags 
such potential inaccuracies or reporting lags would increase the risk of reserve estimation error 
a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance company  often referred to as the primary company or cedant  the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company  referred to as the reinsurer  and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer 
because the primary insurer under these programs changed in  historical loss data is insufficiently developed 
therefore  reliance has been placed on industry loss development patterns adjusted  based on the management s judgment  to reflect considerations particular to the exposure 
the reliance on external benchmarks  while necessary  creates an additional element of uncertainty 
claims reported to the ceding company by insureds are entered into the ceding company s claim system and ceded to the specialty reinsurance segment on a quarterly basis 
the company mitigates the above risk by engaging an independent third party to perform periodic claims reviews of the ceding companies detailed claim reports to ensure reported claims information appears to be reasonably accurate and timely 
as of december   the company s best estimate of its ultimate liability for unpaid losses and lae  before purchase accounting adjustments  for its specialty reinsurance segment was million 
this amount was determined based on methods which were viewed to be better predictors than other methods 
the evaluation of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae in the specialty reinsurance segment requires that loss development be estimated over an extended period of time without the benefit of credible historical loss development patterns 
as the historical loss development data lacks credibility  reliance has been placed on loss development patterns based on industry loss development patterns judgmentally adjusted to reflect considerations particular to the exposure 
the reliance on external benchmarks  while necessary  creates an additional element of uncertainty 
following is a sensitivity analysis of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae to reasonably likely changes in industry loss development factors used to project current losses to ultimate losses dollars in thousands change in industry loss development factors increase decrease in net loss reserves impact on net income percentage of shareholders equity basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point decrease 
table of contents while management believes that the assumptions underlying the amounts recorded for the reserves for unpaid losses and lae as of december  are reasonable  the ultimate net liability may differ materially from the amount period 
other than temporary investment impairments unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income loss and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
when  in the opinion of management  a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost or amortized cost is considered to be other than temporary  such investment is written down to its fair value 
the amount written down is recorded in earnings as a realized loss on investments 
generally  the determination of other than temporary impairment includes  in addition to other relevant factors  a presumption that if the market value is below cost by a significant amount for a period of time  a write down is necessary 
notwithstanding this presumption  the determination of other than temporary impairment requires judgment about future prospects for an investment and is therefore a matter of inherent uncertainty 
for the year ended december   the company did not experience any declines in investment securities that were determined to be other than temporary 
as of december   the company held fixed income and equity securities with gross unrealized losses of  of which only  were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months 
adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in impairment charges in the future 
the company generally applies the following standards in determining whether the decline in fair value of an investment is other than temporary equity securities 
if an equity security has a market value below of cost and remains below of cost for more than three months  a review of the financial condition and prospects of the company is performed to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
a specific determination is made for any such security 
other equity securities in an unrealized loss position not meeting these quantitative thresholds are evaluated considering the magnitude and reasons for the decline and the prospects for the fair value of the securities to recover in the near term 
if the decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  then the cost basis of the security is written down to realizable value and the amount of the write down is accounted for as a realized loss 
fixed income securities 
a fixed income security generally is written down if the company is unable to hold or otherwise intends to sell a security with an unrealized loss  or if it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security 
a fixed income security is reviewed for collectibility if any of the following situations occur a review of the financial condition and prospects of the issuer indicates that the security should be evaluated  moody s or standard poor s rate the security below investment grade  or the security has a market value below of amortized cost due to deterioration in credit quality 
deferred acquisition costs certain direct policy acquisition costs consisting of commissions  premium taxes  fronting fees and certain other direct underwriting costs are deferred and amortized as the underlying policy premiums are earned 
as of december  and  deferred policy acquisition costs and the related unearned premium reserves in the company s workers compensation insurance  segregated portfolio cell reinsurance  group benefits insurance  and specialty reinsurance segments were as follows in thousands workers compensation insurance segment deferred policy acquisition costs unearned premium reserves segregated portfolio cell reinsurance segment deferred policy acquisition costs unearned premium reserves group benefits insurance segment deferred policy acquisition costs unearned premium reserves specialty reinsurance segment deferred policy acquisition costs unearned premium reserves 
table of contents acquisition costs of the group benefits insurance segment are not capitalized and deferred as the group benefits insurance policies are cancelable and not guaranteed renewable 
in addition  the group benefits insurance policies provide coverage on a month to month basis with most policies coverage effective on the first of each month 
as a result  most of the premiums are earned as of the balance sheet date and all direct expenses related to the issuance or renewal of policies are recognized when incurred 
deferred income taxes the temporary differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities are recorded as deferred income taxes 
management evaluates the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset based on historical trends of generating taxable income or losses  as well as expectations of future taxable income or loss 
as of december   the company recorded a net deferred tax asset of million 
management expects that the net deferred tax asset is fully recoverable 
if this assumption were to change  any amount of the net deferred tax asset that the company could not expect to recover would be provided for as an allowance and would be reflected as an increase in income tax expense in the period in which it was established 
reinsurance recoverables amounts recoverable from company s reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reserves for unpaid losses and lae associated with the reinsured policy 
amounts paid for reinsurance contracts are expensed over the contract period during which insured events are covered by the reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reported separately as assets  instead of being netted with the appropriate liabilities  because reinsurance does not relieve the company of its legal liability to its policyholders 
reinsurance balances recoverable are subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
additionally  the same uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses affect the estimates for the ceded portion of these liabilities 
the company continually monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers and where necessary obtains collateral 
as of december   the company had reinsurance recoverables of million 
all of the company s reinsurers had an am best financial strength rating of a or better as of december  recent accounting pronouncements sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting the company are credit risk  interest rate risk  and equity risk 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer 
the company addresses this risk by investing primarily in fixed income securities which are rated a or higher by standard poor s 
the company also independently  and through the company s outside investment manager  monitors the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed income securities in the portfolio 
to limit the company s exposure to risk  the company employs diversification rules that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
interest rate risk 
the company had fixed income investments with a fair value of million at december   that are subject to interest rate risk 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate risk through an asset liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of the company s liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the company s interest rate risk 
it illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of the company s fixed income and convertible bond portfolio to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of the company s fixed income and convertible bond portfolio and shareholders equity dollars in thousands 
hypothetical change in interest rates estimated change in fair value estimated fair value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in shareholders equity basis point increase basis point increase basis increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point decrease equity risk 
equity risk is the risk that the company may incur economic loss due to adverse changes in equity prices 
the company s exposure to changes in equity prices primarily results from its holdings of exchange traded funds and other equities 
the company s portfolio of equity securities is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
since only a small percentage of the company s assets are invested in equity securities  the company does not believe that its exposure to equity price risk is significant 
impact of inflation inflation rates may impact the company s financial condition and operating results in several ways 
fluctuations in rates of inflation influence interest rates  which in turn affect the market value of the investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
inflation also affects the portion of losses and loss reserves that relates to hospital and medical expenses and property claims and loss adjustment expenses  but not the portion of losses and loss reserves that relates to workers compensation indemnity payments for lost wages  which are fixed by statute 
adjustments for inflationary effects are included as part of the continual review of loss reserve estimates 
increased costs are considered in setting premium rates  and this is particularly important in the health care area where hospital and medical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are affected to a certain degree by the inflation rate
