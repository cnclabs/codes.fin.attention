item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes for the years ended december   and on january   duke energy completed the spin off of its natural gas business to shareholders  as discussed below 
accordingly  the results of operations of duke energy s natural gas transmission business segment and duke energy s ownership interest in dcp midstream have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented 
additionally  in april  duke energy consummated the merger with cinergy 
executive overview objectives 
during  management of duke energy focused on the following objectives  as outlined in the charter establish the identity and culture of the new duke energy  unifying its people  values  strategy  processes and systems  optimize its operations by focusing on safety  simplicity  accountability  inclusion  customer satisfaction  cost management and employee development  achieve public policy  regulatory and legislative outcomes that balance customers needs for reliable energy at competitive prices with shareholders expectation of superior returns  invest in energy infrastructure that meets rising customer demands for reliable energy in an energy efficient and environmentally sound manner  and achieve financial objectives and position duke energy to meet future growth targets 
with the completion of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january   duke energy began its first year as primarily an electric utility and met or exceeded most of its financial and non financial objectives established for see financial results below for discussion of duke energy s financial results 
overall  during a year of record breaking heat and an exceptional drought in the carolinas  duke energy was able to meet its productivity challenges as the coal fleet experienced superior operational performance and three of duke energy s nuclear units set new capacity factor records 
additionally  duke energy focused on regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow duke energy to balance the need for cleaner  more efficient power sources with future energy needs of its customers 
planning for future capital expansion was a primary focus in over the next five years  duke energy plans to spend approximately billion on capital expenditures  with approximately billion anticipated to support the us franchised electric and gas segment 
of this amount  approximately of this capital is expected to go towards new pulverized coal  igcc  gas and renewable generation resources to meet growing customer demand 
during and early  duke energy achieved important milestones with various state and federal regulators related to future capital projects 
in the carolinas  the ncuc approved the construction of one state of the art coal generation unit at duke energy carolinas existing cliffside steam station and duke energy carolinas entered into an engineering  procurement  construction and commissioning services agreement with an affiliate of the shaw group  inc related to participation in the construction of cliffside unit  which has a current cost estimate of approximately billion  which includes approximately billion of afudc 
in january  the north carolina department of environment and natural resources issued the final air permit for cliffside unit  which was the last regulatory hurdle before construction could begin 
additionally  in december  cpcn s to build two mw combined cycle natural gas fired generating facilities  one each at the existing dan river and buck steam stations  were filed with the ncuc 
duke energy carolinas is also continuing to seek all necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed william states lee iii nuclear station  including december filings of a col application with the nrc  which was approved in february  and an integrated resource plan with the ncuc and pscsc 
duke energy carolinas also currently plans to file a cpcn related to the nuclear project in south carolina during although these actions are necessary steps as management continues to pursue the option of building a new nuclear plant  submitting these applications does not commit duke energy carolinas to build a nuclear unit 
in indiana  the iurc issued an order in november granting duke energy indiana cpcn s for the proposed mw igcc power plant at the edwardsport generating station  which has an estimated cost of construction of approximately billion  including afudc 
the order also approved the timely recovery of costs related to the project 
in january  the indiana department of environmental management approved the air permit for the project  and major construction is expected to begin in the spring of duke energy is assessing the potential for a joint owner for the facility  but could retain all of the plant capacity if a joint owner is not identified 
the continued development of renewable energy as part of duke energy s generating portfolio was another primary focus of management during climate change concerns  as well as the high price of oil  have sparked increased support for renewable 
table of contents part ii energy legislation at both the federal and state level 
for example  the new energy legislation passed in north carolina in establishes a renewable portfolio standard for electric utilities at of output by  rising gradually to by in response to this legislation  during  duke energy carolinas issued request for proposals rfp seeking bids for power generate from renewable energy sources  including sun  wind  water  organic matter and other sources 
a similar rfp has also been issued by duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana 
additionally  in support of a strategy to increase its renewable energy portfolio in its unregulated businesses  duke energy acquired the wind power development assets of energy investor funds from tierra energy in may three of the development projects acquired from tierra energy are anticipated to be in commercial operation in late or and duke energy has already contracted to purchase wind turbines that are capable of generating approximately mw when placed in commercial operation 
management is also making progress on increasing the role energy efficiency will have in meeting customers growing energy needs 
energy efficiency is considered a fifth fuel in the portfolio available to meet customers growing needs for electricity  along with coal  nuclear  natural gas and renewable energy 
during  new energy efficiency plans were filed in north carolina  south carolina and indiana and energy efficiency programs were expanded in both kentucky and ohio 
the energy efficiency plans filed in north carolina  south carolina and indiana are save a watt programs that would compensate duke energy for verified reductions in energy use and be available to all customer groups 
the pscsc and iurc have scheduled evidentiary hearings in to review these filings for south carolina and indiana  respectively 
in advance of the evidentiary hearing held february  related to the south carolina energy efficiency filing  a settlement agreement was reached with the south carolina office of regulatory staff  wal mart  piedmont natural gas and the south carolina energy users committee 
this agreement calls for duke energy carolinas to bear the cost of the programs and allow for recovery of of the avoided generation charges 
an evidentiary hearing is expected to be scheduled by the ncuc for north carolina in duke energy also participated in the development of energy legislation in various jurisdictions in both north carolina and south carolina passed comprehensive energy legislation during this legislation includes provisions that will allow duke energy to recover new plant financing costs during the construction phase and allows recovery of costs of certain reagents used in emission removal 
the north carolina legislation also includes a renewable energy portfolio standard discussed above 
additionally  the ohio senate introduced senate bill sb  which proposes a comprehensive change to ohio s electric energy industry restructuring legislation 
if enacted  sb provides a workable framework for the development of new technologies  the building of new generation  environmental improvement  as well as energy efficiency 
sb is currently pending before the ohio house of representatives and could be enacted during the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  duke energy carolinas completed its first comprehensive rate case in north carolina since duke energy carolinas reached a settlement with interveners and the ncuc approved it 
overall  the rate settlement reduces customer rates in north carolina without significantly impacting current earning levels 
although earnings levels will not be significantly impacted as a result of the rate settlement  future cash flows will be reduced as a result of a reduction in customer rates effective january  the decrease in revenues from the decrease in customer rates will be mostly offset by the discontinuance of amortization of clean air expenditures 
future clean air expenditures of approximately million through will be capitalized as a component of rate base 
additionally  the puco affirmed duke energy ohio s rsp  which had been remanded by the ohio supreme court to the puco for further consideration 
the ruling maintained the current price and provided for continuation of the existing rate components  including the recovery of costs related to new pollution control equipment and capacity costs associated with power purchase contracts to meet customer demand  but provided customers an enhanced opportunity to avoid certain pricing components if they are served by a competitive supplier 
overall  the regulatory and legislative accomplishments during have positioned duke energy well for and beyond 
financial results 
for the year ended december   duke energy reported net income of  million and basic and diluted earnings per share eps of and  respectively  as compared to reported net income of  million and basic and diluted eps of and  respectively  for the year ended december  eps basic and diluted decreased for as compared to  primarily due to lower net income  which is discussed below  and earnings per share being impacted by the dilutive effect of the issuance of approximately million shares in april related to the cinergy merger 
income from continuing operations was  million for  as compared to  million for due largely to the inclusion of cinergy operations for a full year in versus nine months in the prior year 
total reportable segment ebit increased from  million to  million 
an increase for us franchised electric and gas of million was primarily related to million of first quarter ebit contributed by cinergy s regulated midwest operations for which there was zero in the comparable period of the prior year  as well as improved results in both the carolinas and midwest in due largely to favorable weather and additional long term wholesale contracts  partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense 
segment ebit for commercial power increased 
table of contents part ii million due to improved retail electric margins resulting largely from timing of fuel and purchased power recoveries  higher overall prices and favorable weather  favorable mark to market results  and improved results from the midwest gas fired assets as a result of higher generation and capacity revenues  partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense 
higher segment results at international energy of million are primarily a result of higher equity earnings at national methanol company nmc  higher prices in latin america and favorable foreign currency exchange impacts  as well as the absence of a million litigation reserve and a million impairment charge recorded in segment results for crescent decreased from million in to million in  reflecting the million gain on sale of an effective interest in crescent and the subsequent reduction in ownership from to an effective in september  two large sales that occurred in the second quarter of  lower residential developed lot sales in and an impairment charge on certain residential developments in in addition  losses at other decreased as a result of lower costs related to captive insurance  lower merger costs  lower corporate governance costs and a benefit in related to contract settlement negotiations  partially offset by convertible debt costs of approximately million related to the spin off of spectra energy 
in addition to the increase in total reportable segment and other ebit  income from continuing operations for as compared to was negatively impacted by higher income tax expense from continuing operations and higher interest expense 
income tax expense from continuing operations increased as a result of higher pre tax income and a higher effective tax rate in compared to largely due to certain favorable tax matters in that lowered the effective tax rate in interest expense increased due primarily to the debt assumed from cinergy 
partially offsetting these unfavorable results was higher interest income  largely as a result of increased earnings from higher average invested cash and short term investment balances during as compared to  including a million favorable impact related to the inclusion of amounts for legacy cinergy for the first quarter of with no comparable amount in more than offsetting the increase in income from continuing operations was a decrease in income from discontinued operations for as compared to  primarily attributable to the classification of the results of operations for the natural gas businesses spun off on january  as discontinued operations for periods prior to the spin off 
duke energy s direction in and beyond 
management of duke energy is focusing on the following objectives in and beyond pursue a balanced approach to meeting future energy needs by pursuing new supply options  including energy efficiency  coal gasification  advanced pulverized coal  nuclear  natural gas fired generation and renewable energy  while considering whether they are available  affordable  reliable and clean  accept the reality of a carbon constrained world and pursue low carbon and no carbon solutions for meeting future energy needs  finding a path to success during this era of rising costs by striving to control costs  run the businesses efficiently and provide excellent customer service  and meet financial objectives and  for the long term  deliver on its promise to shareholders by steadily growing earnings and dividends the majority of future earnings are anticipated to be contributed from us franchised electric and gas  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses that currently own a capacity of approximately  megawatts of generation 
the regulated generation portfolio consists of a mix of coal  nuclear  natural gas and hydroelectric generation  with the substantial majority of all of the sales of electricity coming from coal and nuclear generation facilities 
while the drought conditions in the carolinas did not significantly impact earnings in  continued or sustained drought conditions could have a negative impact on earnings in commercial power has net capacity of approximately  megawatts of unregulated generation  of which approximately  megawatts serves retail customers under the rsp in ohio 
approximately of international energy s net capacity of approximately  megawatts of installed generation capacity in latin america consists of base load hydroelectric capacity that carries a low level of dispatch risk  in addition  for over of international energy s contractible capacity in latin america is either currently contracted or receives a system capacity payment 
as mentioned earlier  during the five year period from to  duke energy anticipates total capital expenditures of approximately billion 
annual capital expenditures are currently estimated at approximately billion in and approximately billion in these expenditures are principally related to expansion plans  maintenance costs  environmental spending related to clean air act requirements and nuclear fuel 
current estimates are that duke energy s regulated generation capacity will need to increase by approximately  megawatts over the next ten years  with the majority being in the carolinas 
duke energy is committed to adding base load capacity at a reasonable price while modernizing the current generation facilities by replacing older  less efficient plants with cleaner  more efficient plants 
significant expansion projects include the new igcc plant at duke energy indiana s edwardsport generating station  a new mw coal unit at duke energy carolinas existing cliffside facility in north carolina and new gas fired generation units at duke energy carolinas existing dan river and buck steam stations  as well as other additions due to system growth 

table of contents part ii additionally  duke energy is evaluating the potential construction of a new nuclear power plant in cherokee county  south carolina 
costs related to environmental spending are expected to decrease over the five year period as the upgrades to comply with the new environmental regulations are completed 
duke energy anticipates capital expenditures at commercial power will primarily relate to growth opportunities  such as renewable energy generation projects and environmental control equipment  as well as maintenance on existing plants 
capital expenditures at international energy  which will be funded with cash held or raised by international energy  will primarily be for strategic growth opportunities  such as new hydro plants in brazil  as well as maintenance on existing plants 
duke energy does not anticipate any additional capital investment related to its investment in the crescent jv 
duke energy does not currently anticipate funding capital expenditures with the issuance of common equity in the foreseeable future  but rather through the use of available cash and cash equivalents as well as the issuance of incremental debt 
as the majority of duke energy s anticipated future capital expenditures are related to its regulated operations  a risk to duke energy is the ability to recover costs related to such expansion in a timely manner 
energy legislation passed in north carolina and south carolina in provides  among other things  mechanisms for duke energy to recover financing costs for new nuclear or coal base load generation during the construction phase 
in indiana  duke energy has received approval to recover its development costs for the new igcc plant at the edwardsport generating station 
duke energy has received approval for nearly million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of the cliffside facility as well as the igcc plant in indiana 
in addition  duke energy has received general assurances from the ncuc that the north carolina allocable portion of development costs associated with the william states lee iii nuclear station will be recoverable through a future rate case proceeding as long as the costs are deemed prudent and reasonable 
duke energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state legislators or regulators 
in response to concerns over climate change  the us congress has been discussing various proposals to reduce or cap co and other greenhouse gas emissions 
any legislation enacted as a result of these efforts could involve a market based cap and trade program 
in anticipation  duke energy is increasing focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives in an effort to reduce emissions 
in addition to the wind assets purchased during  duke energy carolinas  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana have issued rfp s for renewable energy sources that can be operational as early as additionally  new energy efficiency plans were filed in north carolina  south carolina and indiana and energy efficiency programs were expanded in both kentucky and ohio 
energy efficiency filings are expected to be made in ohio and kentucky in the energy efficiency plans filed in north carolina  south carolina and indiana are save a watt programs that would compensate duke energy for verified reductions in energy use and be available to all customer groups 
the pscsc and iurc have scheduled evidentiary hearings in to review these filings for south carolina and indiana  respectively 
in advance of the evidentiary hearing held february  related to the south carolina energy efficiency filing  a settlement agreement was reached with the south carolina office of regulatory staff  wal mart  piedmont natural gas and the south carolina energy users committee 
this agreement calls for duke energy carolinas to bear the cost of the programs and allow for recovery of of the avoided generation charges 
an evidentiary hearing is expected to be scheduled by the ncuc for north carolina in in summary  duke energy is coordinating its future capital expenditure requirements with regulatory initiatives in order to ensure adequate and timely cost recovery while continuing to provide low cost energy to its customers 
economic factors for duke energy s business 
duke energy s business model provides diversification between stable  less cyclical businesses like us franchised electric and gas  and the traditionally higher growth and more cyclical energy businesses like commercial power and international energy 
additionally  crescent s portfolio strategy is diversified between residential  commercial and multi family development 
all of duke energy s businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy  including low market prices of commodities  all of which are beyond duke energy s control  and could impair duke energy s ability to meet its goals for and beyond 
declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns would reduce overall electricity sales and lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially as industrial customers reduce production and  thus  consumption of electricity 
a portion of us franchised electric and gas business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale or a change in fair value of assets held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 

table of contents part ii duke energy s goals can also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the united states are subject to regulation on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
changes to regulations are ongoing and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on its business 
duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses as there are timing differences as to when such costs are recovered in rates 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge known exposures 
additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity

segment results management evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest and taxes from continuing operations  after deducting minority interest expense related to those profits ebit 
on a segment basis  ebit excludes discontinued operations  represents all profits from continuing operations both operating and non operating before deducting interest and taxes  and is net of the minority interest expense related to those profits 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are managed centrally by duke energy  so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement  and interest and dividend income on those balances  are excluded from the segments ebit 
management considers segment ebit to be a good indicator of each segment s operating performance from its continuing operations  as it represents the results of duke energy s ownership interest in operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  business segments  for a discussion of duke energy s segment structure 
as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations and assets held for sale during the third quarter of  the board of directors of duke energy authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all former dena s remaining assets and contracts outside the midwestern united states and certain contractual positions related to the midwestern assets

critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as duke energy s operations change and accounting guidance evolves 
duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that they believe are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting duke energy accounts for certain of its regulated operations primarily us franchised electric and gas under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets 
total regulatory assets were  million as of december  and  million as of december  total regulatory liabilities were  million as of december  and  million as of december  amounts at december  include balances related to the natural gas businesses that were spun off on january  for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
goodwill impairment assessments at december  and  duke energy had goodwill balances of  million and  million  respectively 
duke energy evaluates the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the majority of duke energy s goodwill at december  relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april  whose assets are primarily included in 
table of contents part ii the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
the remainder relates to international energy s latin american operations 
goodwill at december  included approximately  million which primarily related to the acquisition of westcoast energy  inc westcoast in march and was included in the spin off of the natural gas businesses in january as of the acquisition date  duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
as required by sfas no 
 duke energy performs an annual goodwill impairment test and updates the test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
key assumptions used in the analysis include  but are not limited to  the use of an appropriate discount rate  estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation  maintenance  and general and administrative costs 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts  as well as other factors  into its revenue and expense forecasts 
duke energy did not record any impairment on its goodwill as a result of the  or impairment tests required by sfas no 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
revenue recognition revenues on sales of electricity and gas  primarily at us franchised electric and gas  are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered 
unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue kilowatt hour or per thousand cubic feet mcf for all customer classes to the number of estimated kilowatt hours or mcf s delivered but not billed 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly period to period as a result of factors including seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns and customer mix 
unbilled revenues  which are recorded as receivables in duke energy s consolidated balance sheets at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the amount at december  excludes unbilled revenues related to the natural gas businesses transferred in january  as discussed above 
accounting for loss contingencies duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business 
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and records a loss contingency based on the accounting guidance set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 which requires a loss contingency to be recognized when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly reviews current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties  such as federal  state and local courts and other regulators 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved  which could have a material impact on future results of operations  financial position and cash flows of duke energy 
duke energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by duke energy carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to amounts recognized as asbestos related reserves related to duke energy carolinas in the consolidated balance sheets totaled approximately  million and  million as of december  and  respectively  and are classified in other deferred credits and other liabilities and other current liabilities 
these reserves are based upon the minimum amount in duke energy s best estimate of the range of loss of  million to  million for current and future asbestos claims through the reserves balance of  million as of december  consists of approximately million related to known claimants and approximately million related to unknown claimants 
management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against duke energy carolinas after in light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer term forecast  management does not believe that we can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after related to such potential claims 
asbestos related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation  if applicable  and are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  the nature of the alleged injury  and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change our estimated liability  as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial 
a federal legislative solution  further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability 
given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters 
table of contents part ii into the future and numerous other factors outside duke energy carolinas control  management believes that it is reasonably possible duke energy carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves 
while it is reasonably possible that such excess liabilities could be material to operating results in any given quarter or year  management does not believe that such excess liabilities would have a material adverse effect on duke energy s long term results of operations  liquidity  or consolidated financial position 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
through december   duke energy has made approximately million in payments that apply to this retention 
the insurance policy limit for potential insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
probable insurance recoveries of approximately  million and  million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets primarily in other within investments and other assets as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy considers the existence of uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims or any significant solvency concerns related to the insurance carrier  and is not aware of such uncertainties as of december  for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
accounting for income taxes duke energy accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
and fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  duke energy may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
prior to the adoption of fin on january   duke energy recorded tax contingencies based on the accounting guidance set forth in sfas no 
 which requires a contingency to be both probable and reasonably estimable for a loss to be recorded 
upon adoption of fin  duke energy began recording unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
in accordance with fin  duke energy records the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining duke energy s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation recorded against duke energy s net deferred tax assets  if any 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  duke energy s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates

table of contents part ii the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement benefit expense and duke energy s pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to duke energy s estimates of other post retirement benefits 
the prescription drug trend rate assumption resulted from the effect of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act modernization act 
duke energy plans duke energy and its subsidiaries including legacy cinergy businesses maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans plans 
the plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain legacy cinergy employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under a final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives 
duke energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax qualified pension cost of million  pre tax non qualified pension cost of million and pre tax other post retirement benefits cost of million in in  duke energy s qualified pension cost is expected to be approximately million lower than in as a result of the contribution to the qualified plans  non qualified pension cost is expected to remain approximately the same as and other post retirement benefits cost is expected to be approximately million lower than in as a result of the aforementioned voluntary contribution to the other post retirement benefit plans 
for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumed that its plan s assets would generate a long term rate of return of as of december  the assets for duke energy s pension and other post retirement plans are maintained in a master trust 
the investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation target was set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile with respect to the trust 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
us equities  debt securities  and real estate are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the expected long term rate of return of for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes were for us equities  for non us equities  for fixed income securities  and for real estate 
if duke energy had used a long term rate of in  pre tax pension expense would have been higher by approximately million and pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by less than million 
if duke energy had used a long term rate of pre tax pension expense would have been lower by approximately million and pre tax other post retirement expense would have been lower by less than million 
duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of as of december  duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using rates of as of september  for its non legacy cinergy business pension plans and as of april  for its legacy cinergy business pension plans 
for legacy cinergy plans  the discount rate reflects remeasurement as of april  due to the merger between duke energy and cinergy 
duke energy determines the appropriate discount based on aa bond yields 
the yield is selected based on bonds with cash flows that are similar to the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments under the plan 
lowering the discount rates by would have decreased duke energy s pre tax pension expense by approximately million 
increasing the discount rates by would have increased duke energy s pre tax pension expense by approximately million 
lowering the discount rates by would have increased duke energy s pre tax other post retirement expense by approximately million 
increasing the discount rate by would have decreased duke energy s pre tax other post retirement expense by less than approximately million 

table of contents part ii duke energy s us post retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in medical health care costs 
duke energy s us post retirement plan uses a prescription drug trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in prescription drug health care costs 
as of december   the medical care trend rates were  which grades to by as of december   the prescription drug trend rate was  which grades to by if duke energy had used health care trend rates one percentage point higher  pre tax other post retirement expense would have been higher by million 
if duke energy had used health care trend rates one percentage point lower  pre tax other post retirement expense would have been lower by million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy s pension and post retirement plans will impact duke energy s future pension expense and liabilities 
management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future

liquidity and capital resources known trends and uncertainties at december   duke energy had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately billion  partially offset by approximately million of short term notes payable and commercial paper 
during  duke energy will rely primarily upon cash flows from operations  borrowings and its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund its liquidity and capital requirements 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of the us franchised electric and gas business segment compose a substantial portion of duke energy s cash flows from operations and it is anticipated that they will continue to do so for the next several years 
a material adverse change in operations  or in available financing  could impact duke energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory constraints  economic trends  and market volatility see item a 
risk factors for details 
duke energy projects capital and investment expenditures of approximately billion  primarily consisting of billion at us franchised electric and gas billion at commercial power billion at international energy and billion at other duke energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors with an overall focus on positive net cash generation 
based on this goal  approximately percent of total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the us franchised electric and gas segment 
total us franchised electric and gas projected capital and investment expenditures include approximately billion for system growth  billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants and infrastructure to serve load growth  approximately billion of environmental expenditures  and approximately billion of nuclear fuel 
as a result of duke energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating fleet through the construction of new units  as well as its focus on increasing its renewable energy portfolio  the ability to cost effectively manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction 
should duke energy encounter significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state commissions  and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates  future cash flows could be adversely impacted 
duke energy anticipates its debt to total capitalization ratio to be approximately by the end of  as compared to approximately at the end of this increase is primarily due to expected debt issuances in  primarily to fund capital expenditures 
duke energy expect its total debt balance including outstanding commercial paper balances to increase approximately billion in additionally  duke energy has expected debt retirements of approximately billion in  which includes scheduled maturities of approximately billion and approximately billion of early retirements of long term debt that are expected to be refinanced 
in january  duke energy carolinas issued million principal amount of mortgage bonds 
proceeds from the issuance will be used to fund capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper 
based upon anticipated cash flows from operations  capital expenditure and dividend payments  duke energy expects to increase outstanding commercial paper balances during  however  duke energy expects that the current total available capacity under its commercial paper facilities to be sufficient to meet any additional commercial paper requirements 

table of contents part ii due to recent financial market developments  including certain liquidity issues within the short term investment markets and a series of write downs by some companies in the values of their investments in subprime us mortgage related assets  duke energy performed an assessment to determine the impact  if any  of current market developments on duke energy s financial position 
as of december  and late february  there were no investments in subprime mortgage related assets within duke energy s short term investment balances 
as of december   duke energy held approximately million of investments in auction rate debt securities  substantially all of which were sold at auction in january at full principal amounts 
duke energy made new investments in auction rate debt securities in january and february  and as of late february  duke energy holds approximately million of investments in auction rate debt securities 
the vast majority of these investments are in us federal government backed student loans 
as a result of the aforementioned credit market developments  these investments  which historically have provided short term liquidity through a periodic auction process  have become increasingly illiquid as a result of failed auctions 
auction rate securities are designed such that interest rates on these instruments reset periodically through an auction process  so long as demand for the debt at the auction date is sufficient to cover the amount being submitted by the existing holders for auction 
in the event demand is less than the amount being auctioned  a failed auction would occur and duke energy would begin receiving a higher interest rate on its investments in the auction rate debt at the failed auction interest rate 
as a result of recent auction failures  it is necessary for duke energy to hold these investments for longer periods of time than the historical short term holding periods 
however  duke energy does not currently believe there is any significant risk of credit default by the issuers and duke energy expects to be able to liquidate its holdings in the future at amounts approximating their current book value 
duke energy also performed an assessment of its investments held in trusts  including those that will be used to satisfy future obligations under its pension and other post retirement benefit plans and future obligations to decommission duke energy carolinas nuclear plants 
based on this assessment  it has been determined that an insignificant portion of the holdings within the trusts are directly invested in subprime mortgage related assets or auction rate debt securities 
duke energy does not believe that any decline in the fair value of these subprime mortgage related assets or auction rate debt securities will have a material impact on its results of operations or its future cash funding requirements 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information on the investment objectives of duke energy with respect to its pension and other post retirement benefit plan assets  and to item a 
risk factors 
as of december  and mid february  duke energy had approximately million of auction rate pollution control bonds outstanding 
while these debt instruments are long term in nature and cannot be put back to duke energy prior to maturity  the interest rates on these instruments are designed to reset periodically through an auction process 
in february  duke energy began to experience failed auctions for a portion of these debt instruments 
when failed auctions occur on a series of this debt  duke energy is required to begin paying a failed auction interest rate on the instrument 
the failed auction interest rate for the majority of the auction rate debt is times one month libor 
payment of the failed auction interest rates will continue until duke energy is able to either successfully remarket these instruments through the auction process or refund and refinance the existing debt through the issuance of an equivalent amount of tax exempt bonds 
duke energy is currently pursuing a refunding and refinancing plan  which is subject to approval by applicable state or county financing authorities and utility regulators 
if duke energy is unable to successfully refund and refinance these debt instruments  the impact of paying higher interest rates on the outstanding auction rate debt is not expected to materially effect duke energy s overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
further  at this time  duke energy does not believe the recent market developments significantly impact its ability to obtain financing and fully expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets at reasonable rates and terms 
additionally  duke energy has access to unsecured revolving credit facilities  which are not restricted upon general market conditions  with aggregate bank commitments of approximately billion  of which a portion is currently committed primarily to backstop duke energy s commercial paper program 
duke energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its debt covenants during however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view 
if and when management had a belief that such potential breach could exist  appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue 
duke energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating agencies 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million in  compared to  million in  a decrease in cash provided of million

it is expected that the majority of current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets will be paid in cash in contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years beyond in millions long term debt a capital leases a operating leases b purchase obligations g firm capacity payments c energy commodity contracts d other purchase obligations e h other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets f total contractual cash obligations a see note to the consolidated financial statements  debt and credit facilities 
amount includes interest payments over life of debt or capital lease 
payment amounts exclude million of debt issued by duke energy carolinas in january interest payments on variable rate debt instruments were calculated using interest rates derived from examination of the forward interest rate curve 
in addition  a spread was placed on top of the interest rates to aid in capturing the volatility inherent in projecting future interest rates 
b see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
c includes firm capacity payments that provide duke energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity  and the option to convert natural gas to electricity at third party owned facilities tolling arrangements in some power locations throughout north america 
also includes firm capacity payments under electric power agreements entered into to meet us franchised electric and gas native load requirements 
d includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities of electricity  coal and nuclear fuel 
amount includes certain normal purchases  energy derivatives and hedges per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

for contracts where the price paid is based on an index  the amount is based on forward market prices at december  for certain of these amounts  duke energy may settle on a net cash basis since duke energy has entered into payment netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 

table of contents part ii e includes us franchised electric and gas obligation to purchase an additional ownership interest in the catawba nuclear station see note to the consolidated financial statements  joint ownership of generating and transmission facilities  as well as contracts for software  telephone  data and consulting or advisory services 
amount also includes contractual obligations for engineering  procurement and construction costs for new generation plants and nuclear plant refurbishments  environmental projects on fossil facilities  and major maintenance of certain non regulated plants 
amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand  for which the timing of the purchase can not be determined 
f includes certain estimated executive benefit payments and contributions to the ndtf see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
the amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as duke energy may use internal resources or external resources to perform retirement activities 
as a result  cash obligations for asset retirement activities are excluded 
asset retirement obligations recognized on the consolidated balance sheets total  million and the fair value of the ndtf  which will be used to help fund these obligations  is  million at december  amount excludes reserves for litigation  environmental remediation  asbestos related injuries and damages claims and self insurance claims see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies because duke energy is uncertain as to the timing of when cash payments will be required 
additionally  amount excludes annual insurance premiums that are necessary to operate the business  including nuclear insurance see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  funding of other post employment benefits see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and regulatory credits see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters because the amount and timing of the cash payments are uncertain 
also excludes deferred income taxes and investment tax credits on the consolidated balance sheets since cash payments for income taxes are determined based primarily on taxable income for each discrete fiscal year 
additionally  amounts related to uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table due to uncertainty of timing of future payments 
g current liabilities  except for current maturities of long term debt  and purchase obligations reflected in the consolidated balance sheets have been excluded from the above table 
h includes approximately billion of anticipated remaining costs associated with an engineering  procurement and construction services agreement executed during with an affiliate of the shaw group  inc  for participation in the construction of cliffside unit and a flue gas desulfurization system at an existing unit at cliffside 
duke energy has the right to terminate this agreement at any time for its convenience  subject to customary cancellation and demobilization charges in accordance with terms of the agreement 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies duke energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit exposure  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
duke energy s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the treasurer and other members of management  on market risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
the treasurer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk  including monitoring exposure limits 
commodity price risk duke energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
duke energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations using various commodity derivatives  including swaps  futures  forwards and options 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management and hedging activities  credit risk  and financial instruments 
validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from duke energy s deal origination areas 
while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques  changes in duke energy s pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
duke energy closely monitors the risks associated with these commodity price changes on its future operations and  where appropriate  uses various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel 
certain derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured each month 
in addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  duke energy enters into other contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception described in paragraph of sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted by derivatives implementation group issue c  scope exceptions normal purchases and normal sales exception for option type contracts and forward contracts in electricity  and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments 
table of contents part ii and hedging activities 
for contracts qualifying for the scope exception  no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract unless the contract is designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
on a limited basis  us franchised electric and gas and commercial power apply the normal purchase and normal sales exception to certain contracts 
recognition for the contracts in the consolidated statements of operations will be the same regardless of whether the contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges or as normal purchases and sales  unless designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge  assuming no hedge ineffectiveness 
income recognition and realization related to normal purchases and normal sales contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
however  duke energy s decision to reduce former dena s interest in partially completed plants and the decision in to sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of former dena s remaining physical and commercial assets outside of the midwestern united states and certain contractual positions related to the midwestern assets see normal purchases and normal sales below required the reassessment of all associated derivatives  including normal purchases and normal sales 
this required a change from the application of the accrual model to the mark to market mtm model for these contracts and resulted in recording substantial unrealized losses that had not previously been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
other derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore accounted for using the mtm model 
these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts see undesignated contracts below 
generation portfolio risks 
duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power  natural gas  and coal prices in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
duke energy optimizes the value of its bulk power marketing and non regulated generation portfolios 
the portfolios include generation assets power and capacity  fuel  and emission allowances 
the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units 
the generation portfolio not utilized to serve native load or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations  although the impact on the consolidated statements of operations reported earnings is partially offset by mechanisms in the regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change per mega watt hour in forward wholesale power prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying or undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change per mmbtu in natural gas prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  excluding the impact of mark to market changes on undesignated hedges relating to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
normal purchases and normal sales 
during the third quarter of  duke energy s board of directors authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former dena s remaining assets and contracts outside the midwestern united states  approximately  megawatts of power generation  and certain contractual positions related to the midwestern assets see note to the consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
as a result of this decision  duke energy recognized a pre tax loss of approximately billion in the third quarter of for the disqualification of its power and gas forward sales contracts previously designated under the normal purchases normal sales exception 
this loss was partially offset by the recognition of a pre tax gain of approximately billion for the discontinuance of hedge accounting for natural gas and power cash flow hedges 
undesignated contracts 
undesignated contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks are exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power and coal 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change in the forward price per megawatt hour of wholesale power would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  resulting from the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying and undesignated power contracts pertaining to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent change in the forward price per ton of coal would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and would have had a million impact in  resulting from the impact of mark to market changes on non qualifying and undesignated coal contracts pertaining to periods in excess of one year from the respective date 
other commodity risks 
at december  and  pre tax income in and was not expected to be materially impacted for exposures to other commodities price changes 
the commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels  but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices 

table of contents part ii duke energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that duke energy would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  duke energy seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
duke energy attempts to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable duke energy to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
duke energy may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of duke energy s counterparties obligations 
duke energy s principal customers for power and natural gas marketing and transportation services are industrial end users  marketers  local distribution companies and utilities located throughout the us and latin america 
duke energy has concentrations of receivables from natural gas and electric utilities and their affiliates  as well as industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions 
these concentrations of customers may affect duke energy s overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector 
where exposed to credit risk  duke energy analyzes the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
through december   duke energy has made approximately million in payments that apply to this retention 
the insurance policy limit for potential insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
probable insurance recoveries of approximately  million and  million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets primarily in other within investments and other assets as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims or any significant solvency concerns related to the insurance carrier 
based on duke energy s policies for managing credit risk  its exposures and its credit and other reserves  duke energy does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty 
during  duke energy finalized the sale of the former dena portfolio of derivative contracts to barclays bank plc and sold the cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to fortis  which eliminated duke energy s credit  collateral  market and legal risk associated with these related trading positions 
in  the industrial development corp of the city of edinburg  texas idc issued approximately million in bonds to purchase equipment for lease to duke hidalgo hidalgo  a subsidiary of spectra energy capital 
spectra energy capital unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the lease payments of hidalgo to idc through in  hidalgo was sold to calpine corporation and spectra energy capital remained obligated under the lease guaranty 
in january  hidalgo and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in connection with the previous bankruptcy filing by its parent  calpine corporation in december gross  undiscounted exposure under the guarantee obligation as of december  is approximately million  including principal and interest payments 
duke energy does not believe a loss under the guarantee obligation is probable as of december   but continues to evaluate the situation 
therefore  no reserves have been recorded for any contingent loss as of december  no demands for payment have been made under the guarantee 
if losses are incurred under the guarantee  spectra energy capital has certain rights which should allow it to mitigate such loss 
subsequent to the spin off the natural gas businesses  this guarantee remained with spectra energy capital 
however  duke energy indemnified spectra energy capital against any future losses that could arise from payments required under this guarantee 
in january  calpine corporation announced that it had successfully emerged from chapter bankruptcy protection and officially concluded its chapter reorganization 
duke energy s industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
duke energy frequently uses master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents an unsecured credit limit  determined in accordance with the corporate credit policy 
collateral agreements also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions 
duke energy also obtains cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on its financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 

table of contents part ii interest rate risk duke energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
duke energy manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
duke energy also enters into financial derivative instruments  which may include instruments such as  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  risk management and hedging activities  credit risk  and financial instruments  and debt and credit facilities 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   it was estimated that if market interest rates average higher lower in than in  interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would increase decrease by approximately million 
comparatively  based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   had interest rates averaged higher lower in than in  it was estimated that interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would have increased decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the increase in interest rate sensitivity is primarily due to a decrease in cash and short term investment balances and a net increase in commercial paper borrowings 
if interest rates changed significantly  management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in duke energy s financial structure 
equity price risk duke energy maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc and the ncuc  to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
as of december  and  these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  debt securities  fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
per nrc and ncuc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates  and fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not affect duke energy s consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an order by the ncuc 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates 
bison  duke energy s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  maintains investments to fund various business risks and losses  such as workers compensation  property  business interruption and general liability 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
duke energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates could adversely affect duke energy s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  for additional information on pension plan assets 
foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposures are expected to be the brazilian real and the peruvian new sol 
a devaluation in the currency exchange rates as of december  in all of duke energy s exposure currencies would result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations in the consolidated balance sheet would be negatively impacted by approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  as a result of a devaluation in the 
table of contents part ii currency exchange rates 
as of december   a devaluation in the currency exchange rates in all of duke energy s exposure currencies was expected to result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations and a reduction of approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  other issues energy policy act of the energy policy act of was signed into law in august the legislation directs specified agencies to conduct a significant number of studies on various aspects of the energy industry and to implement other provisions through rulemakings 
among the key provisions  the energy policy act of repeals the puhca of  directs ferc to establish a self regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with ferc oversight  extends the price anderson act for years until  provides loan guarantees  standby support and production tax credits for new nuclear reactors  gives ferc enhanced merger approval authority  provides ferc new backstop authority for the siting of certain electric transmission projects  streamlines the processes for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines  and reforms hydropower relicensing 
in late and early  ferc initiated several rulemakings as directed by the energy policy act of duke energy is currently evaluating these proposals and does not anticipate that these rulemakings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
global climate change 
a body of scientific evidence now accepted by a growing majority of the public and policymakers suggests that the earth s climate is changing  caused in part by greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere from human activities 
although there is still much to learn about the causes and long term effects of climate change  many advocate taking steps now to begin reducing emissions with the aim of stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases at a level that avoids the potentially worst case effects of climate change 
greenhouse gas emissions are produced from a wide variety of human activities 
the us epa publishes an inventory of these emissions annually 
co  an essential trace gas  is a by product of fossil fuel combustion and currently accounts for about of us greenhouse gas emissions 
duke energy currently accounts for about of total us co emissions  and about of total co greenhouse gas emissions 
duke energy is adding approximately  new customers annually to its customer base of nearly four million in the carolinas and the midwest and making long term decisions for how best to meet its customers growing demand for electricity 
duke energy is moving ahead on multiple fronts energy efficiency  renewable energy  advanced nuclear power  advanced clean coal and high efficiency natural gas electric generating plants  and retirement of older less efficient coal fired power plants 
duke energy needs regulatory certainty regarding us climate change policy as it makes these investment decisions 
duke energy s cost of complying with any federal greenhouse gas emissions law that may be enacted will depend on the design details of the program 
the major design elements of a greenhouse gas cap and trade program that will most influence duke energy s compliance costs include the required levels and timing of the cap  which will drive emission allowance prices  the emission sources covered under the cap  the number of allowances that duke energy is allocated on a year to year basis  the type of and effectiveness of the cost control mechanism employed by the program  and the availability and cost of technologies that duke energy can deploy to lower its emissions 
although it is likely that congress will adopt some form of mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction legislation in the future  the timing and specific requirements of any such legislation are highly uncertain  which means that potential future compliance costs for duke energy are also highly uncertain 
the th congress is currently considering several potential us policy responses to the climate change issue 
in  nearly a dozen bills were introduced in the senate calling for mandatory limits on us greenhouse gas emissions through use of a cap and trade program 
the key differences in the bills are the sources whose emissions would be regulated  the rate at which emissions would be required to be reduced  the number of emission allowances that would be distributed at no cost to sources whose emissions would be regulated  and the method of protecting the economy from potentially high and unexpected program costs 
on december   the senate environment and public works committee reported out s 
america s climate security act of sponsored by senators joseph lieberman of connecticut and john warner of virginia 
the bill  which now awaits senate floor action  proposes an economy wide greenhouse gas reduction program to begin in several bills have also been introduced in the house of representatives but none has yet received subcommittee or committee approval 
it is unlikely that legislation establishing a mandatory federal greenhouse gas emission reduction program will be enacted in duke energy supports the enactment of federal greenhouse gas cap and trade legislation that would apply to all parts of the economy  including power generation  industrial and commercial sources  and motor vehicles 
to permit the economy to adjust rationally to the policy  legislation should establish a long term program that first slows the growth of emissions  stops them and then transitions to a gradually declining emissions cap as new lower and non emitting technologies are developed and become ready for wide scale deployment 

table of contents part ii new technologies for reducing co emissions from coal chief among them carbon capture and sequestration are not expected to be developed and ready for deployment by when the lieberman warner legislation  if passed  would take effect 
this would pose a challenge to duke energy s ability to utilize all of its current coal fired generating capacity if the legislation is enacted in its current form 
this could challenge duke energy s ability to meet the growing electricity demand of its customers at a reasonable cost 
duke energy s deployment of renewable generation  along with its customer energy efficiency initiative would help  but would not be enough 
if the cap is too stringent in the early years of the program  duke energy s compliance options could be limited to purchasing emission allowances and or relying on existing natural gas generation to replace coal generation 
achieving a large fuel switch from coal to natural gas in less than four years is not practical and  on a national scale  is not good public policy 
such a shift would significantly increase natural gas prices  posing an economic hardship to millions of natural gas customers 
compliance cost estimates are very sensitive to various highly uncertain assumptions  including allowance prices 
under the proposed s 
legislation  in addition to allowances allocated at no cost  duke energy currently estimates the costs of purchasing needed allowances to cover duke energy s projected emissions in could range from approximately million to billion 
actual costs could be higher or lower than these estimates 
duke energy would seek to recover its compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
under a compliance scenario where duke energy continues to purchase allowances to meet its compliance obligation  annual allowance purchase costs would increase over time as the number of allowances duke energy is allocated under the proposed legislation decreases and allowance prices increase as the cap tightens 
at some point in the future it would be expected that duke energy would begin replacing existing coal fired generation with new lower and zero emitting generation technologies  and or installing new carbon capture and sequestration technology on existing coal fired generating plants to reduce emissions when technologies become available 
it is not possible at this time  however  to predict with certainty what new technologies might be developed  when they will be ready to be deployed  or what their costs will be 
there is also uncertainty as to how or when certain non technical issues that could affect the cost and availability of new technologies might be resolved by regulators 
duke energy currently is focused on advanced nuclear generation  integrated gasification combined cycle generation with carbon capture and sequestration  and capture and storage retrofit technology for existing pulverized coal fired generation as promising new technologies for generating electricity with lower or no co emissions 
in addition to relying on new technologies to reduce its co emissions  duke energy is seeking regulatory approval for a first of its kind innovative approach in the utility industry to help meet growing customer demand with new and creative ways to increase energy efficiency  thereby reducing demand save a watt instead of relying almost exclusively on new power plants to generate electricity
