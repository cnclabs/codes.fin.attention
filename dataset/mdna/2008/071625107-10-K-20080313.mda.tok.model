item a 
risk factors any of the risks discussed below  as well as any of the other risks described in this form k  could materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
industry risks if we cannot compete effectively in the apparel industry our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the retail apparel industry is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of retailers  including national department store chains  national and international specialty apparel chains  outdoor specialty stores  apparel catalog businesses  sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise 
our outlet stores compete with the outlet stores of other specialty retailers as well as with other value oriented apparel chains and national department store chains 
our competitors may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly  devote greater resources to the design  sourcing  distribution  marketing and sale of their products  generate greater national brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
if we are unable to overcome these potential competitive disadvantages or effectively place our products relative to our competition  our business and results of operations will suffer 
adverse changes in the economy may adversely affect consumer spending  which could negatively impact our business 
the specialty retail apparel industry is heavily dependent on discretionary consumer spending patterns 
our business is sensitive to numerous factors that affect discretionary consumer income  including adverse general economic conditions  changes in employment trends and levels of unemployment  increases in interest rates  weather  a significant rise in energy prices or other events or actions that may lead to a decrease in consumer confidence or a reduction in discretionary income 
in addition  increased fuel costs may discourage customers from driving to our retail and outlet locations  reducing store traffic and possibly sales 
declines in consumer spending on apparel and accessories  especially for extended periods  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or quotas  embargoes  safeguards and customs restrictions against apparel items could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices  any of which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
safeguard quotas imposed by the us on categories of goods and apparel imported from china  may impact our sourcing patterns and costs 
we also cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise is currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the us  canadian and foreign governments  nor can we predict the likelihood  type or effect of any such restrictions 
reduced pricing by competitors in the retail apparel industry has affected and may continue to affect our results of operations 
increasing pressure on retailers to reduce prices of their products as a result of increased competition  the increased outsourcing of product manufacturing to countries with lower labor costs  trade liberalization  consolidation among retailers and lower barriers to entry for manufacturers and retailers may force us to lower 
table of contents prices  or make us unable to sell our higher priced products  in which case our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially 
the retail apparel business is seasonal in nature  and any decrease in our sales or margins during these periods could have a material adverse effect on our company 
the retail apparel industry is highly seasonal  with the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on the sales generated during these peak periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during these periods  whether as a result of economic conditions  poor weather or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on our company 
the apparel industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer demands and our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer style preferences in a timely manner will adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the apparel industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences and quickly emerging and dissipating trends 
failure to effectively gauge the direction of customer preferences and anticipate trends  or convey a compelling brand image or price value equation to consumers may result in lower sales and resultant lower gross margins to sell inventory 
we typically place orders with our vendors approximately six months prior to the initial sale date  and so can make only limited modifications to orders in response to changes in customer preferences 
if we are unable to successfully identify changes in customer preferences or anticipate customer demand from season to season  we could experience lower sales  excess inventories  higher mark downs and decreased earnings 
risks relating to our business if we cannot revitalize the eddie bauer brand  our business will be adversely impacted 
our net merchandise sales declined during each of the fiscal years between and and comparable store sales also decreased in of the quarters between and as we discuss in item business and beyond five key initiatives  we have taken  and intend to take  strategic  operational and management actions designed to reconnect with our customers and revitalize eddie bauer as a premium quality brand 
however  we cannot be assured that the changes we have made  or the additional actions we are taking or intend to take  will be successful  or that such actions and changes will not result in the following our desire to attract additional male customers may result in the loss of existing female customers  our addition of higher priced merchandise may drive away existing customers and may not attract new customers  our efforts to increase traffic and sales in our retail and outlet stores may not be cost effective  or our marketing efforts to promote our revitalized brand may not be effective 
if we cannot successfully revitalize the eddie bauer brand  or if the revitalization takes longer than anticipated  our business and our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted 
if customer purchases lag behind our expectations  we may experience decreased net merchandise sales  negative comparable store sales and higher operating losses 

table of contents we face numerous challenges as a result of our involvement in the spiegel bankruptcy process which  if not addressed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as a result of our involvement in the spiegel bankruptcy proceedings  we were required to take actions that we might not otherwise have taken as a stand alone company  including distributing a significant portion of our cash flow and the proceeds of the million senior secured term loan to the creditors of spiegel in june  instead of reinvesting that capital in our business and infrastructure during the bankruptcy process  borrowing significant amounts including million under our senior secured term loan and amounts from time to time under our senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million and as a result becoming subject to the restrictions and limitations imposed by the lenders under our financing facilities  assuming ongoing obligations equal to approximately million associated with spiegel s former pension and other retirement plans  assuming the obligations of spiegel and its subsidiaries to indemnify officers or employees for liability associated with their service  and inheriting support facilities that were not optimally suited for our operations and  as a result  having to sell  streamline  consolidate or relocate some of these facilities 
we have been operating as a stand alone entity for a limited period of time and face additional costs and risks as a result 
we must continue to streamline the back end distribution and logistics operations we inherited and reduce costs throughout our organization 
if we are unable to do so successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
if our management team cannot integrate effectively or if we cannot attract and retain qualified senior and middle management and motivate our retail associates  our business will be adversely affected 
most of the members of our senior management team have been in their positions for less than six months 
our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract qualified individuals to our leadership team and to retain the services of members of our senior management team in the long term through attractive incentive arrangements 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may not be able to retain current employees or attract new employees due to uncertainty relating to our future business prospects 
the loss  for any reason  of the services of key individuals or the failure to attract and retain additional members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
our success also depends on our ability to hire  motivate and retain other qualified associates who reflect and enhance our customer service oriented culture  including our store managers  sales associates and staff at our call centers 
if we are unable to hire and keep enough qualified associates  especially during our peak season  our customer service levels and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be hurt 
our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act over financial reporting may not be effective in future periods  as a result of previously identified weaknesses in internal controls 
in preparing our financial statements in  and early  management identified weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
areas in which weaknesses were identified included the lack of sufficient controls to ensure adequate analysis and documentation regarding fresh start accounting adjustments  accounting for income taxes  including the development of the tax provision  accounting for tax net operating losses nols and related valuation allowances  identification and classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our reliance upon manual closing and reconciliation systems 
we believe we have corrected such weaknesses that lead to errors in financial reporting  but if we fail to identify or are unable to adequately remediate future weaknesses  
table of contents investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements  which would cause the market price of our stock to decline and could lead to stockholder litigation 
if we are not successful in improving profitability of our retail and outlet stores  our business will be adversely affected 
the growth of sales in our stores is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investments and lease costs that allow us to earn a reasonable return 
desirable locations and configurations for reasonable costs may not be available to us because of our inability to improve sales per square foot 
if we cannot negotiate leases on reasonable terms  our business would be adversely affected 
substantially all of our store locations are leased from landlords in regional malls and lifestyle centers and in metropolitan areas 
as a result  each year  a portion of the locations under lease is due for renewal or renegotiation 
in addition  we relocate a certain number of our store locations each year 
landlords typically evaluate the creditworthiness of a tenant and the expected sales volume of the store location in connection with the negotiation of lease terms 
weakening of our financial performance or financial profile  including our sales per square foot  or potential covenant defaults on our debt instruments could ultimately lead landlords to conclude that we do not meet their criteria for risk and return  and result in our inability to negotiate leases on reasonable terms or renew leases 
we depend on a high volume of mall traffic  the lack of which would hurt our business 
many of our stores are located in shopping malls 
sales at these stores are derived  in part  from the volume of traffic in those malls 
traffic in malls where we have stores may be adversely affected by regional economic downturns  the closing of anchor tenants and competition from non mall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores  which will hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our catalogs are not successful  it could adversely affect all of our sales channels 
the success of our catalogs is a key factor in our efforts to revitalize our brand  as we believe the catalogs reinforce our brand image and drive sales across in our retail and outlet stores and direct channels 
if we are unable to continue to attract customers to our catalogs by providing them with appealing and extensive product offerings  our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
factors that may impact our ability to maintain and grow our catalog sales include customer acceptance of our catalog presentations  increases in paper and printing costs  postage rates and other costs relating to our catalog mailings  a failure in the timing of catalog deliveries  and the accuracy  breadth and depth of the information contained in our customer database so we can correctly analyze our mailing lists and maximize our customer targeting efforts 
our website operations may not be successful  which could adversely affect our business 
the success of our website is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the internet  including changing customer preferences and buying trends relating to internet usage  changes in required technology interfaces  increasing costs of placing advertisements and keywords online  website downtime and other technical failures  changes in applicable us and foreign regulation  security breaches and consumer privacy concerns 
our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might hurt our website sales and damage our brand s reputation 
internet sales may also be affected since  unlike some of our online competitors  we collect a sales tax on internet sales 
our processing  storage and use of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation  conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 
our collection and processing of transactions through our sales channels require us to receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data 
this type of data is subject to legislation and regulation in various 
table of contents jurisdictions 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the laws and regulations are expanded  implemented or interpreted to require changes to our business practices and methods of data collection 
in addition  as personal and legal issues relating to privacy and data protection become more sensitive  we may become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the data we collect  manage and process  and may incur legal costs if our information security policies and procedures are not effective or if we are required to defend our methods of collection  processing and storage of personal data 
we may be subject to significant liability if we are required to recall any product or should any of our products cause injury or death 
if the use of any of our products causes  or is alleged to have caused  an injury we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters 
even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued  the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused injury or death could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to recall products  leading to a material adverse effect on our business 
even if a situation does not necessitate a recall  product liability claims might be asserted against us 
a product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial results 
we rely on one sourcing agent for a substantial majority of our sourcing needs 
in  on a purchase value basis  we sourced approximately of our products through one sourcing agent  ebi 
our sourcing agreement with ebi is on a commission basis and is automatically renewed each year unless terminated by either party upon one year written notice 
if the agreement with ebi were terminated or if the terms of the agreement were modified substantially and we did not find an appropriate replacement in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  or if we were unable to transition the ebi functions in house in a cost effective manner  we could experience shortages or delays in receipt of our merchandise  higher costs and quality control issues 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors may perform all or a larger portion of their sourcing functions in house  and  as a result  have lower sourcing costs than we do 
a significant disruption in back end operations could adversely affect our business 
some of our back end systems  particularly relating to information technology  are dated and are an amalgamation of multiple applications  rather than one overarching state of the art system 
if we are unable to effectively streamline these systems and update them where necessary  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any significant interruption in our back end operations resulting from systems failures  associate grievances  natural disasters  inclement weather  accidents or other unforeseen events could lead to delays or other lapses in service relating to the distribution of merchandise to our stores and to our customers  or in the processing of returns from our customers 
if our current back end operations cannot handle a significant increase in transaction volume  we may experience inaccuracy in processing orders or delays in delivering orders 
any delays or lapses in service could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot protect our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights  our business may be adversely affected 
we use many trademarks and product designs in our business 
as appropriate  we rely on the trademark and copyright laws to protect these designs even if not formally registered as marks  copyrights or designs 
we believe these trademarks and product designs are important to our competitive position and success 
third parties may sue us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
the party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims  and we could be forced to incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources to defend the litigation 
moreover  if the party claiming infringement were to prevail  we could be forced to discontinue the use of the related trademark  patent or design and or pay significant damages  or to enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party  
table of contents assuming these royalty or licensing arrangements are available at all on an economically feasible basis  which they may not be 
additionally  we may experience difficulty in effectively limiting unauthorized use of our trademarks and product designs worldwide 
unauthorized use of our trademarks or other proprietary rights may cause significant damage to our brand name and our ability to effectively represent ourselves to our agents  suppliers  vendors  licensees and or customers 
while we intend to enforce our trademark and other proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we are adequately protected in all countries or that we will prevail when defending our trademark and proprietary rights 
if our independent vendors do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations  our business and our reputation could be harmed 
while our global labor practices program and our vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control our independent vendors or their business practices 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines 
violation of labor or other laws by our vendors  or the divergence of a vendor s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us could materially hurt our reputation  which can impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unseasonable or severe weather conditions may adversely impact our net merchandise sales and our operating results 
our business is adversely affected by unseasonal weather conditions 
sales of our outerwear and sweaters are dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products 
further  sales of our spring and summer products  which traditionally consist of lighter clothing  are adversely impacted by cool or wet weather 
in addition  severe weather events typically lead to temporarily reduced traffic at malls where most of our stores are located 
severe weather events may impact our ability to supply our stores  deliver orders to our customers and staff our stores and call centers 
risks relating to our financial condition and results of operations our substantial amount of debt may limit the cash flow available for our operations and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
in connection with the plan of reorganization  we and our subsidiaries entered into a million senior secured term loan agreement  which has since been restated and reduced to million  and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
we also have million in senior convertible notes 
as a result  we have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of debt 
our term loan facility requires that we comply with a substantial number of covenants and conditions related to our operations and financial performance 
our level of debt requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt  which reduces our funds available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limits our flexibility in planning for or reacting to  and heighten our vulnerability to  changes or downturns in our business  the industry or in the general economy  may result in higher interest expense if interest rates increase on our floating rate borrowings  and may also prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out expansion plans  if any 
in addition  the terms of our debt contain various restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  grant liens  dispose of certain property  make certain capital expenditures  and engage in sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates 
we are also required to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio under our term loan and  if certain availability thresholds are not met  a fixed charge coverage ratio under our revolving credit facility 
these restrictions and covenants inhibit our operational flexibility and restrict or prohibit our ability to take actions that could be beneficial to our company and our stockholders 
this may place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors who may not be subject to similar restrictions 

table of contents we may not have sufficient available cash necessary to settle conversion of the senior convertible notes or to purchase the notes upon a fundamental change  and our other debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes 
upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  including certain change of control transactions as set forth in the indenture governing the convertible notes  the company will be required to offer to repurchase the convertible notes for cash at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  to but not including the date of repurchase 
in certain events of default under the indenture  either the trustee thereunder or the holders of at least in principal amount of the then outstanding convertible notes may declare of the principal of the convertible notes and accrued and unpaid interest  including additional interest  to be due and payable 
in addition  upon conversion of the notes after april   we have the right to deliver  in lieu of shares of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
we may not have sufficient cash to pay the principal and accrued interest  together with any premiums due as a result of a fundamental change  on the convertible notes  should there be a fundamental change prior to the time that the limitations on ownership contained in our certificate of incorporation lapse by their terms 
in addition  we may not have sufficient cash to pay in lieu of shares upon conversion 
limitations in our credit facilities may not allow us to borrow the necessary cash to pay the note holders 
we experience fluctuations in our quarterly comparable store sales 
the success of our business depends  in part  upon our ability to increase sales at our existing stores 
our comparable store sales have fluctuated and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future 
various factors affect our comparable store sales  including the number of stores we open and close in any period  the general retail sales environment  changes in our merchandise  competition  customer preferences  current economic conditions  energy prices  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of our marketing programs  the approach and timing of mark down strategies  weather conditions and the overlapping of existing store sales by new stores in existing markets 
our ability to maintain and improve our comparable store sales results depends in large part on improving our forecasting of customer demand and preferences and adjusting our inventory levels accordingly  increasing the number of transactions in each store  selecting effective marketing techniques  providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base and using more effective pricing strategies 
any failure to meet the comparable store sales expectations could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
unexpected outcomes in legal proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions 
from time to time  we are a party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  an increasing number of cases are being filed against companies generally that contain class action allegations under federal and state wage and hour laws 
we estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish accruals for the estimated liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties 
although not currently anticipated by management  unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings  or changes in management s evaluations or predictions related to potential exposure in such suits  could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our reorganization valuation was based in part on estimates of future performance 
if actual results do not meet or exceed the projections in our long term plan  we could experience additional impairment charges that could adversely affect our operating results 
our financial statements reflect the adoption of fresh start accounting under american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop fresh start accounting principles provided  among other things  that we determined the reorganization value of our company and allocated such reorganization value to the fair value of our tangible assets  finite lived intangible assets and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas as of our emergence from bankruptcy 
an independent third party 
table of contents appraisal firm was engaged to assist us in determining our reorganization value 
although we allocated our reorganization value among our assets in accordance with sfas  our allocations were based on estimates and assumptions that may not be realized and are inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
if these results are not achieved  the resulting values could be materially different from our estimates  which could cause us to write down the value of our assets and record non cash impairment charges which could make our earnings volatile 
we may not be able to realize the full amount of our net loss carryforwards  which could impact our financial results and available cash for debt paydown and operations 
we have made certain assumptions regarding our ability to fully utilize our net loss carryforwards  including those from the time of emergence from bankruptcy  as well as losses subsequently generated 
our ability to fully and timely utilize such net loss carryforwards may be impaired if we do not extend the current date upon which the ownership limitations contained in our certificate of incorporation expire and a change of ownership  as defined in the internal revenue code  subsequently occurs before we have applied the loss carryforwards described above 
risks relating to our common stock an active trading market for our common stock may not develop  and there can be no assurance as to the market price for our common stock if an active trading market develops 
while our common stock is currently quoted on the nasdaq global market  we cannot assure that an active market for our common stock will continue to exist 
in addition  the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
in addition  it is possible that investors who have been trading in our stock have been engaging in short selling  which could further cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the trading price of our common stock could also fluctuate due to the factors discussed in this risk factors section 
the trading market for our common stock also may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our industry 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
as a public company we may incur substantial costs to comply with securities laws  rules and regulations  including  in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of future disagreements with our auditors may damage investor confidence 
we have operated as a public company for a limited period of time 
beginning with this annual report  section of sarbanes oxley requires us to include a report each year on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year 
future identified material weaknesses could result in additional costs for accountants to assist us in identifying and correcting weaknesses and for the costs of any required new systems 
additionally  our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our assessment requires us to make subjective judgments and our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our assessment 
at some time in the future  our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management s assessment or conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not operating effectively  resulting in a decrease in investor confidence in our financial statements and potential shareholder litigation 

table of contents provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and senior officer change in control compensation benefits plan could discourage potential acquirers and could deter or prevent a change in control 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and senior officer change in control compensation benefits plan  as well as delaware corporate law  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
these provisions include our ability to issue blank check preferred stock  provisions restricting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders  provisions that set forth advance notice procedures for meetings of stockholders  and payments of certain bonus and severance amounts to covered employees in certain circumstances 
in addition  under our certificate of incorporation  a person or entity who seeks to acquire or more of our outstanding common stock  or a person or entity who already is a direct or indirect stockholder and wishes to increase its ownership  may not acquire such shares unless it has obtained the prior written consent of our board of directors until such time as these restrictions lapse  which will be no later than january  our board may deny any such proposed transaction if it determines in its reasonable assessment that the proposed transaction could jeopardize realization of the full benefits of unrestricted use of our net operating loss carryovers 
in accordance with our certificate of incorporation  any transaction in violation of these ownership restrictions will be void so that a purported transferee will not have any ownership rights with respect to any shares acquired in excess of these ownership restrictions 
therefore  a purported transferee will not be entitled to any rights as a stockholder  including voting  dividend or distribution rights  with respect to any excess shares 
in addition  eddie bauer has the right to demand any purported transferee of excess shares to transfer to an agent of our designation its excess shares for resale by the agent or  if the excess shares have already been sold by the purported transferee  to transfer to the agent any proceeds from the sale by the purported transferee of such excess shares 
these provisions may make it more difficult for other persons or entities  without the approval of our board of directors  to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock  or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder s best interest 
these provisions also may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our ability to utilize our nols and certain other tax attributes may be limited 
as of december   we estimated our federal nols to be approximately million tax affected and our state nols to be approximately million tax affected 
under section of the internal revenue code  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change  the corporation s ability to use its pre change nols and other pre change tax attributes to offset its post change income may be limited 
an ownership change is generally defined as a greater than change in its equity ownership by value over a three year period 
our nols are currently limited under section as a result of the ownership change triggered upon our emergence from bankruptcy 
we may experience a second ownership change in the future as a result of the lapse of the ownership restrictions within our certificate of incorporation  or as a result of conversion of our outstanding convertible notes into shares of our common stock 
if we were to trigger a second ownership change in the future as defined under section  our ability to use any nols existing at that time could be further limited 
future issuances or sales of our securities could cause our stock price to fall 
we may issue securities in the future and may do so in a manner that results in substantial dilution for our stockholders 
in addition  we may issue debt or equity from time to time that ranks in preference to our common stock in the event of a liquidation or winding up or that is secured by an interest in some or all of our assets 
sales of common stock by existing stockholders in the public market  our issuances of new securities or debt  or the expectation that any of these events might occur could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our dividend policies and other restrictions on the payment of dividends prevent the payment of dividends for the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our subsidiaries because we are a holding company 
the terms of certain of our outstanding indebtedness prohibit us from paying dividends 
accordingly  investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return  which may never occur 
investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  financial conditions  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board deems relevant

in june  we emerged from bankruptcy as a stand alone company for the first time in years 
we are committed to turning our business around and revitalizing eddie bauer as a premium quality brand  both by continuing to implement initiatives that we commenced over the past several years and by actively changing initiatives that are not performing up to our expectations 
as of december   we operated stores  consisting of retail stores and outlet stores in the us and canada 
during  we had million visits to our two websites and circulation of approximately million catalogs 
we are minority participants in joint venture operations that sell eddie bauer branded products through retail and outlet stores  websites and catalogs in japan and germany  and we license the eddie bauer name to various consumer product manufacturers and other retailers whose products complement our brand image 
business developments proposed merger in november  we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement with a company owned by affiliates of sun capital partners  inc and golden gate capital  under which all of the company s outstanding shares of common stock were to be converted into the right to receive per share in cash upon closing of the transaction 
on february   at a special meeting of our stockholders  an insufficient number of shares were voted in favor of the merger 
as a result  we terminated the merger agreement and are now refocused on the long term effort of rebuilding brand image and increasing our sales per square foot to historic levels 
our results of operations for the first quarter of were negatively impacted by a million termination fee we were required to pay in accordance with the merger agreement 
ceo resignation and appointment of new ceo and other executives in the first half of  we saw the departure of our chief executive officer and several senior members of management 
in conjunction with the ceo s resignation  we recorded million of expense  including million of accelerated stock based compensation expense  during the first quarter of the chief financial officer had resigned in  and we had yet to hire a replacement 
following the failure to approve the merger  we began recruitment efforts aimed at building a management team to formulate and implement a turnaround of our business 
on june   we hired neil fiske as chief executive officer and president 
in july  we hired a new senior vice president of human resources 
in november a new chief financial officer  new general counsel and senior vice president of sourcing and supply joined the company  filling the remaining open positions on the management team 
additionally  in february  we appointed a new senior vice president of merchandising 
together with mr 
fiske  this new team and the existing senior vice president of retail will be instrumental in advancing the initiatives underlying our turnaround plan discussed under and beyond five key initiatives above 

table of contents term loan refinancing and senior convertible notes in june  upon our emergence from bankruptcy  the proceeds of a million term loan facility the term loan were paid to certain creditors of spiegel corporation 
in april  we prepaid million and entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement  which reduced the principal balance of the term loan to million and extended the maturity date to april  also in april  we closed our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes with a maturity date of april  in december  we prepaid an additional million of the term loan principal balance 
see further discussion below of our various credit vehicles within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
and beyond five key initiatives the new management team has set initiatives  formulated strategies to achieve these initiatives  and has begun to take action to implement the initiatives in  with the goal of rebuilding the eddie bauer brand as a leader in outerwear and apparel for an active outdoor lifestyle 
given the to month lead time to develop and introduce merchandise into our sales channels  the turnaround of the eddie bauer business will be a multi year effort 
our five key initiatives for are clarify the brand position and rebuild brand identity upgrade the quality of the merchandise and align the assortment strategy to the new brand position revamp the creative marketing function and fully exploit our marketing advantage as a direct multi channel retailer cut costs to become more competitive and profitable realign the organization and build talent to accomplish our goals see item business and beyond five key initiatives for an expanded discussion of our key initiatives for loyalty program in september  we launched our first full scale customer loyalty program  eddie bauer friends  for eddie bauer customers 
the loyalty program allows customers in the united states to accrue points that may be redeemed for eddie bauer rewards certificates or used toward acquiring special eddie bauer merchandise 
the full terms and conditions of the loyalty program are available at www 
eddiebauerfriends 
com 
as of december   approximately million customers have enrolled in our loyalty program  and approximately of our us net merchandise sales are generated in transactions utilizing a loyalty card 
we continue to evaluate the performance of our loyalty program on an on going basis 
we believe that the program will be a valuable tool in driving customer purchases and fostering customer loyalty while facilitating our ability to track and market to our customers 

table of contents real estate the table below represents our retail and outlet store activity during fiscal and fiscal fiscal number of retail stores open at beginning of period opened during the period closed during the period open at the end of the period number of outlet stores open at beginning of period opened during the period closed during the period open at the end of the period the number of stores we ultimately open during any given year will depend on our ability to obtain suitable locations on favorable terms  our working capital  general economic conditions  and the terms of our debt agreements 
in addition to closing underperforming stores and opening new stores  our strategy includes right sizing our existing stores  mainly through downsizing and relocations 
we are generally satisfied with the retail store prototype size of approximately  square feet excluding outlet stores 
currently  approximately of our retail stores fall within of this prototype size 
we do not anticipate a significant change in store count over the short term  as we focus on increasing store productivity  as measured by sales per square foot  driven by our branding  merchandising and marketing initiatives 
as we improve productivity  we will have the opportunity to develop a longer term real estate strategy that more appropriately balances our retail and outlet store counts 
during  we completed the build out of our office space at our new leased headquarters in bellevue  washington and relocated our headquarters personnel to this new facility 
industry trends overall  with the exception of certain categories of luxury goods  in the retail industry experienced slowing sales growth and the need to increase markdowns of goods to move inventory 
we believe this slowing was due to a number of factors  including a general lack of consumer confidence in the strength of the us economy during an election year  higher fuel costs which discourage unnecessary shopping trips and depreciation in housing values nationwide 
the industry by nature is seasonal  with significant increases in revenues and expenses in the fourth quarter of each year due to holiday purchases 
additional industry factors that may impact our results in fiscal and beyond include the following activewear and outerwear two categories that we intend to focus on in fiscal continue to show sales growth  a shift towards consumers being more willing to purchase either premium apparel at higher prices or value apparel with lower prices  and being less willing to purchase mid priced apparel  the increased availability of quality  global low cost sourcing for apparel due to the elimination of import quotas in the us  which puts deflationary pressures on pricing and further lowers barriers to entry  and the maturation and fragmentation of the apparel industry by channel of distribution  age  gender  price points and classification  as well as the increase in brand proliferation  especially with the growth of private label brands  will increase competitive pressure on our sales

net merchandise sales for fiscal were up million  or  compared to the prior year and comparable store sales increased by 
the increase in our net merchandise sales during the fourth quarter and fiscal was primarily driven by increases of million and million in our direct sales in the fourth quarter and full year periods  respectively  and increases in our retail and outlet stores of million and million  respectively compared to the prior year fourth quarter and full year periods 
comparable stores sales increased in our retail stores during the fourth quarter and fiscal periods by and  respectively 
we believe the quarter over quarter and year over year increases in net merchandise sales were a result of the following more focused marketing efforts  both in store and through our catalogs  with bolder messages on annual events such as our pant event  down event  days of giving and ultimate sale a biannual event  and targeted merchandising emphasizing fewer colors and styles but rather historically successful merchandise  such as our down outerwear and gift items 
we have seen improved results in both our men s and women s lines 
customer response to the merchandise lines were encouraging  as evidenced by increases in comparable store sales of   and in each of the quarters of  respectively

comparable store sales in outlet stores have declined  having increased in the first quarter and declined  and in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and for the full year period  as compared to the prior year periods 
although overall units purchased per transaction increased in our outlet stores  a decline in outlet store traffic driven in part by higher fuel costs and in part by consumer concerns over economic issues during  particularly during the fourth quarter  contributed to our decline in outlet store comparable sales 
we believe that the decline in outlet store traffic was industry wide 
outlet store comparable sales declines for eddie bauer were also attributed to product mix  which in fiscal emphasized less seasonal novelties and more wardrobe commodity items 
our gross margin and gross margin percentages for the fourth quarter of were million and and million and for fiscal these amounts compared to million and for the fourth quarter of and million and for fiscal gross margins were negatively impacted in both the fourth quarter and fiscal year by more in season markdowns as we sought to increase our sell through on seasonal inventories 
additionally  our gross margins during the fourth quarter and fiscal were negatively impacted by higher levels of inventory writedowns and costs associated with our customer loyalty program 
these negative impacts to our gross margin were partially offset by a slight decrease in our occupancy costs in both periods 
sg a expenses during the fourth quarter and fiscal increased by million and million  respectively  versus the prior year periods 
the fourth quarter increase in sg a expenses primarily reflected 
table of contents higher advertising and marketing costs 
fiscal sg a expenses were negatively impacted by several one time costs associated with our terminated merger agreement and resignation of our former ceo 
see further discussion of our fiscal versus fiscal sg a expenses below under results of operations 
as part of our five key initiatives  we plan to reduce our overall costs  including sg a expenses  by to million in  and in the first quarter of have implemented a workforce reduction in corporate support personnel in furtherance of such expense cuts 
outlook to increase our profitability and generate cash for future growth  we will need to effectively leverage our existing multi channel infrastructure and increase our productivity  as measured by our comparable store sales and sales per square foot in our retail and outlet stores and through higher year over year sales in our direct channel 
we believe that the five key initiatives identified above will continue the stronger sales momentum we saw in the fourth quarter of  although weakening of consumer confidence and a general slowing in retail specialty apparel industry growth may impact our ability to increase our sales per square foot and comparable store sales in improvement in our gross margins and profitability also depends upon our ability to source our products at cost effective prices  control our transportation and energy costs and reduce our need for inventory markdowns 
we have added a new senior vice president of sourcing and supply to evaluate and improve our sourcing costs and practices  although we do not expect to see any measurable profit improvements in this area until fiscal additionally  our ability to control store occupancy and buying costs and efficiently manage our back end operations and fixed costs will also impact our future gross margins and profitability 
as discussed above  we have several initiatives underway to reduce costs and improve efficiency  including efforts to streamline our supply chain and logistics operations 
we have already reduced our corporate headcount 
we anticipate that these initiatives will reduce our costs of sales and sg a 
despite our strategy to design products that appeal to our target customers  changes in customer preferences or demand or lack of customer response to these designs could result in increased costs and lower margins if we are required to increase our inventory markdowns or redesign our product offerings 
we plan to continue our customer loyalty program during  which will continue to result in revenue impacts  higher cost of sales and put pressure on our gross margin during fiscal we must continue to make improvements in the merchandise collection and improve our net merchandise sales in order to develop a sustainable trend of improving results 
results of operations the following is a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal  and our historical results for periods prior to july  are not comparable with our results for periods subsequent to july  for several reasons

the primary differences between our calculated federal tax benefit of million of our pre tax loss of million and our income tax expense of million primarily resulted from tax expense associated with the cash we collected related to our financing receivables  including the cash we collected in december related to the sale of the receivables  and increases to our valuation allowance requirements associated with our federal and state nols 
the cash we collected related to the financing receivables is included in our taxable income  however the majority of the related note payments equal to of the cash receipts we made to the creditor s trust are non deductible for income tax purposes 
the cash collected on the receivables and related sale resulted in federal tax expense of million for fiscal during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax expense of million to increase our valuation allowance related to our federal nols  resulting from several changes in circumstances during first  we determined that the additional restrictions on federal nol utilization under section resulting from the anticipated change in control upon expiration of the ownership limitations established within 
table of contents our certification of incorporation were no longer likely to occur 
we made this conclusion as a result of the terminated merger agreement which occurred in fiscal additionally  we had assumed that our board of directors would lift the ownership restrictions effective january   which did not occur 
accordingly  we used the original section limitation resulting from the bankruptcy related ownership change  and no longer assumed a second change in control upon the lapse of the ownership limitations  when determining the valuation allowance required as of december  this change resulted in a higher section limitation  allowing for increased nol utilization in the future 
also  in determining the amount of nol carryforwards that were more likely than not expected to be realized  we determined that we would take into account only our projected taxable income for the next three fiscal years 
we changed our assumption related to future years in which we could rely on having taxable income due to our recent history of book losses and taxable losses when excluding the taxable income generated by our financing receivables which we sold in december using these assumptions  we estimated that a valuation allowance of million was required as of december  related to our federal nols 
also during the fourth quarter of  we recognized million of income tax expense related to state nols we generated in  which we determined needed a full valuation allowance as we anticipate that these nols will expire unused 
additionally  in the course of preparing our state income tax returns during the fourth quarter of  we received additional information from our prior parent company  spiegel  related to certain state nols that existed as of our fresh start reporting date that we had previously assumed a full valuation allowance against

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our annual impairment tests for both goodwill and trademarks in accordance with sfas no 
 which resulted in a pretax impairment charge totaling million related to trademarks

the decline in the fair value of our trademarks since july  was due principally to decreases in projected revenues 
the annual impairment review of our goodwill balance as of the fourth 
table of contents quarter of fiscal was completed using the two step approach prescribed in sfas no 
and resulted in no impairment charge 
as a result of interactions with our investment bankers  preliminary indications of interest received from various third parties during our publicly announced process of evaluating various strategic alternatives  and the significant decline in our common stock price during the third quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our enterprise was below our carrying value 
accordingly  in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed impairment tests for our indefinite lived intangible assets  including our goodwill and trademarks  during the third quarter of the fair value of our trademarks during the third quarter of was determined using the discounted present value of estimated future cash flows  which was based upon our five year long range plan  a terminal value growth rate of and a discount rate of and was estimated to be million  equal to their net book value 
accordingly  no impairment charge was recorded during the third quarter of related to our trademarks 
our enterprise value for purposes of our goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of was estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow model and was further supported by valuations using market comparables and market transactions for other retail companies and our common stock price 
the premise of the discounted cash flow model was based upon our five year long range plan related to the future cash flows of our primary assets 
the discounted cash flow valuation used a discount rate of  which represented our weighted average cost of capital and a terminal value growth rate of 
in order to assess our fair value in its entirety  following the calculation of the discounted cash flows of our primary assets  the book value of our interest bearing debt was deducted and the fair values of the assets not contributing to the discounted cash flows of our primary assets  including our nol carryforwards  were added to derive the fair value of our total net assets 
upon completion of step one of the goodwill impairment test  our estimated enterprise fair value was less than the carrying value of our net book value and long term debt 
accordingly  we completed step two of the goodwill impairment test  which included comparing the implied fair value of the company with the carrying amount of goodwill 
upon completion of step two of the goodwill impairment test  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our goodwill 
the decline in our fair value since our fresh start reporting date of july  was due principally to lower than projected revenues and gross margins 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests for both our goodwill and trademarks consistent with the testing performed during the third quarter of we concluded that our enterprise value and the fair value of our trademarks approximated the values as determined during our impairment tests during the third quarter of as there were no significant changes in our long range forecast  discount rate or terminal value growth rate 
additionally  our results of operations during the fourth quarter of were consistent with the long range plan used during our third quarter impairment review 
our estimated enterprise value as of the fourth quarter of exceeded our net carrying value and accordingly  we concluded that we passed step one of our goodwill impairment test 
our impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter of and third and fourth quarters of included reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections and were based on estimates of projected future cash flows 
we experienced lower than anticipated sales during the second half of and the first three quarters of  indicative of a weaker than expected response by our customers to our merchandise collection 
the long range projections used in our impairment evaluations assume that we will successfully introduce merchandise assortments that appeal to our core customer tastes and preferences and respond to future changes in customer style preferences in a timely and effective manner 
these estimates of future cash flows are based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores  catalogs and internet sites  estimates of future profitability and economic conditions 
future estimates of profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to twenty years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability  are difficult to predict and in certain cases  beyond our control 
the assumptions utilized by management were consistent with those developed in conjunction with our long range planning process 
if the assumptions and projections underlying these evaluations are not achieved  or should we ultimately adopt and pursue different long range plans  the 
table of contents amount of the impairment could be adversely affected 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that there will not be additional impairment charges in the future based on future events and that the additional charges would not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations

in april  we requested and received an amendment to the prior term loan that provided a waiver through the first quarter of  of compliance with certain covenants contained in the prior term loan  however  the covenant relief that we obtained would have expired after the first quarter of  resulting in the reestablishment of the original terms related to the financial covenants 
as a result of our expectation that we would not meet certain of the financial covenants during  we entered into the refinancing transaction discussed below during april of 
table of contents refinancing transaction on april   eddie bauer  inc entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement with various lenders  goldman sachs credit partners lp  as syndication agent  and jpmorgan chase bank  lp  as administrative agent the amended term loan agreement

we entered into the amended term loan agreement as a result of our expectation that we would not meet certain of the financial covenants within our prior term loan during in connection with the amended term loan agreement  million of the loans were prepaid  reducing the principal balance of the prior term loan from million to million 
we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in april  which represented the unamortized deferred financing fees of the prior term loan 
this loss on extinguishment was reflected within other income  net on our statement of operations during fiscal we incurred million of financing fees related to the amended term loan agreement and convertible notes issuance discussed further below  which we capitalized as deferred financing fees 
these deferred financing fees are being amortized over the life of the amended term loan agreement and convertible notes 
the amended term loan agreement extends the maturity date of the prior term loan to april   and amends certain covenants of the prior term loan 
as of december   million was outstanding under the amended term loan  of which million were in eurodollar loans and million were base rate loans 
in february  we made an additional prepayment of million of proceeds received from the sale of certain financing receivables described in footnotes to financial statements note

in the event we make voluntary prepayments or mandatory prepayments as a result of asset sales or other transactions as specified within the agreement  future principal payments are reduced in accordance with the terms of the amended term loan agreement 
as discussed in note to our financial statements  we sold our interest in our financing receivables in december as a result of this asset sale  we were required to use the net cash proceeds from the sale as a payment under our senior term loan

we face a number of uncertainties that may adversely affect our ability to generate sales and earnings  including potential weakness in the retail environment in north america  which weakness may negatively affect future retail sales 
convertible notes on april   we closed our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
the convertible notes have a maturity date of april  and pay interest at an annual rate of semiannually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
we filed a shelf registration statement in july under the securities act of relating to the resale of the convertible notes and the common stock to be issued upon conversion of the convertible notes pursuant to a registration rights agreement 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective on september  the convertible notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of our existing and future subsidiaries that are parties to any domestic credit facilities  whether as a borrower  co borrower or guarantor  including eddie bauer  inc the convertible notes are unsecured and senior obligations of us and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness 

table of contents the convertible notes are not convertible prior to the termination of our ownership limitations contained in our certificate of incorporation  which will occur not later than january  except upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions  as set forth in the indenture governing the convertible notes 
following the termination of the ownership limitations and prior to april   holders may convert all or a portion of their notes under the following circumstances i during any calendar quarter commencing after june  if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the conversion price for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  ii during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period measurement period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day in the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such day  or iii upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as set forth in the indenture governing the convertible notes 
on or after april   holders may convert their notes at any time prior to pm  new york city time  on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
the initial conversion rate  which is subject to adjustment  for the notes was shares per  principal amount of notes which represented an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we have the right to deliver  in lieu of shares of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  provided that if the notes are converted prior to termination of the ownership limitations  we must pay cash in settlement of the converted notes 
a holder will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares 
upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  including certain change of control transactions as set forth in the indenture governing the convertible notes  we will be required to offer to repurchase the convertible notes for cash at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  to but not including the date of repurchase 
in the event of certain events of default under the indenture either the trustee thereunder or the holders of at least in principal amount of the then outstanding convertible notes may declare of the principal of the convertible notes and accrued and unpaid interest  including additional interest  to be due and payable 
as a result of the requirement that we settle any conversion of notes prior to the termination of the ownership limitations contained in our certificate of incorporation in cash  the conversion features contained within the convertible notes are deemed to be an embedded derivative under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the embedded derivative related to the conversion features requires bifurcation from the debt component of the convertible notes and a separate valuation 
we recognize the embedded derivative as an asset or liability on our balance sheet and measure it at its estimated fair value  and recognize changes in its estimated fair value in other income  net in the period of change 
with the assistance of a third party  we estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative primarily using the black scholes model and other valuation methodologies which resulted in an estimated fair value of million as of the issuance date for the convertible notes 
the estimated fair value of the conversion features is recorded with the convertible note liability on our balance sheet 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative will be adjusted at each reporting date in the future 
we estimated the fair value of the conversion features to be million as of december  and accordingly recognized million within other income  net during fiscal the decline in the estimated fair value of our derivative liability since the issuance date for the convertible notes was primarily a result of the decline in our common stock price 
as a result of the required bifurcation of the embedded derivative related to the conversion features of the notes under sfas  the carrying value of the convertible notes at issuance was million 
we are accreting the difference between the face value of the notes and the carrying value  which totaled million as of the date of issuance  as a charge to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the convertible notes 
we recognized million of discount amortization within interest expense during fiscal  which resulted in an effective interest rate of approximately related to the convertible notes 

table of contents interest rate swap agreements we use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates  to lower our overall costs of financing and to manage the mix of floating and fixed rate debt in our portfolio 
our derivative instruments as of december  and december  included an interest rate swap agreement 
additionally  our convertible notes included an embedded derivative as discussed further above 
prior to the amendment of our prior term loan  we had an interest rate swap which totaled million as of december  the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted of the outstanding amount under the term loan  which had floating rate debt  to a fixed rate by having us pay fixed rate amounts in exchange for the receipt of the amount of the floating rate interest payments 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  a monthly net settlement was made for the difference between the fixed rate of and the variable rate based upon the monthly libor rate on the notional amount of the interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the prior term loan  and was scheduled to terminate in conjunction with the termination of the prior term loan in june on april   we terminated our interest rate swap agreement as a result of our entering into the amended term loan agreement 
upon termination  we received million in settlement of the interest rate swap and recognized a gain of million within other income  net on our statement of operations 
on april   we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement and designated the new interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of the amended term loan 
the new interest rate swap agreement had a notional amount of million as of december  the interest rate swap agreement effectively converts a portion of the outstanding amount under the amended term loan  which has a floating rate of interest  to a fixed rate by having us pay fixed rate amounts in exchange for the receipt of the amount of the floating rate interest payments 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  a monthly net settlement is made for the difference between the fixed rate of and the variable rate based upon the monthly libor rate on the notional amount of the interest rate swap 
no portion of the interest rate swap was excluded from the assessment of the hedge s effectiveness 
because all critical terms of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged forecasted transaction were not identical  the interest rate swap did not qualify for the shortcut method of accounting as defined in sfas on a quarterly basis  we assess and measure the effectiveness of the cash flow hedge using the changes in variable cash flows method 
in performing our assessment as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was determined to be a liability of million and the changes in the cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument were within to percent of the opposite change in the cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction and therefore we concluded that the hedge was highly effective 
accordingly  we recorded the effective portion of the cash flow hedge  which totaled million million net of tax as of december  within other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
no amount of the cash flow hedge was determined to be ineffective 
the amounts reflected in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into interest expense in the same period in which the hedged debt affects interest expense 
we estimate that no amounts will be reclassified into interest expense within the next months 
the new interest rate swap agreement is scheduled to terminate in april financial condition at december  compared to december  our total assets were million as of december   down million  or from december  current assets as of december  were million  down million from million as of december  the decline in our current assets was driven primarily by a million decrease in our cash and cash equivalents see further discussion above under liquidity and capital resources cash flow analysis and a million decrease in our financing receivables 
these decreases were partially offset by million of restricted cash as of december  the decline in our financing receivables was due to cash collected from the financing receivables during fiscal and the sale of the outstanding receivables in december thirty percent of the aggregate selling price of the financing receivables  or million  is being held in escrow holdback and will be used to satisfy  if any  i purchase price adjustments  ii breaches of sac s representation and warranties  and iii sac s obligation 
table of contents to indemnify the buyers against certain losses or damages 
under the terms of the sale agreement  one half of the remaining holdback will be paid during the first quarter of and one half during the second quarter of we are required to pay of any holdback received to the creditor trust and accordingly we have reflected this amount  which totaled million  on our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash as of december  see further discussion of the cash we collected related to the financing receivables and sale of the outstanding receivables balance in footnotes to financial statements note 
non current assets as of december  were million  down million from million as of december  the decline in our non current assets was driven primarily by a million decrease in our non current deferred tax assets as our deferred tax liabilities exceeded our deferred tax assets as of december   an million decrease in our other intangible assets due to the amortization recorded during fiscal  and a million decrease in our goodwill due to adjustments we recorded to properly reflect our state nols as of our fresh start reporting date 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in our property  plant and equipment due to capital expenditures during fiscal our total liabilities were million as of december   an increase of million  or  from december  current liabilities as of december  were million  down million from million as of december  the decline in our current liabilities was driven by a million decrease in our current liabilities related to our securitization note as a result of the cash payments and sale of the related financing receivables as discussed further above  which was partially offset by the million liability to the spiegel creditor trust we recorded as of december   which reflects the holdback from the sale of the receivables which we will be required to pay to the trust upon our receipt of the holdback during fiscal non current liabilities as of december  were million  an increase of million from million as of december  the increase in our non current liabilities reflected million related to the fair value of our convertible notes we issued in april  million of non current deferred tax liabilities as our deferred tax liabilities exceeded our deferred tax assets as of december   and a million increase in our deferred rent obligations primarily due to construction allowances we received from our landlords for leasehold improvements 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our senior term loan due to the million we repaid with the refinancing of the loan in april and principal payments of million and million in december our stockholders equity as of december  totaled million  down million from december   driven primarily by our net loss recorded for fiscal cash requirements our primary cash requirements for fiscal are to fund working capital to support anticipated merchandise sales increases  capital expenditures to open new stores and refurbish existing stores  maintain our distribution center and information technology systems  and to make interest payments on our senior term loan and convertible notes 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million or million net of landlord contributions  of which approximately relates to opening and remodeling of stores in accordance with our plans to realign our stores  as compared to capital expenditures of million during fiscal  which included capital expenditures related to new store openings  store remodels and capital expenditures related to the move of our corporate headquarters in mid in  we plan to spend up to an additional million to refixture our existing stores to support new merchandise initiatives in outerwear and activewear 
we anticipate opening seven new retail and six new outlet stores and closing retail and four outlet stores during fiscal we finance the opening of the new stores through cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facility 
we estimate that capital expenditures to open a store will approximate million and million per store for retail and outlet stores  respectively 
in substantially all instances  this capital investment is funded partially by the landlords of the leased sites 
the portion funded by landlords typically ranges from to 
additionally  we expect initial inventory purchases for the new retail and outlet stores to average approximately million 

table of contents our liquidity levels and the need to fund our cash requirements through the use of our revolving credit facility will be driven by our net sales and profitability levels  changes in our working capital  the timing of our capital expenditures and by interest payments on our term loan and convertible notes 
cash generated from our net sales and profitability  and somewhat to a lesser extent our changes in working capital  are driven by the seasonality of our business  with a disproportionate amount of net merchandise sales and operating cash flows occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
additionally  cash generated from our net sales and profitability are impacted by the levels of and timing of markdowns that we take in order to drive sales 
seasonality also impacts the levels of our working capital  in that we typically experience higher levels of net accounts receivables and sales driven accrued expenses  such as sales and use taxes  sales allowances  and deferred revenues during the fourth quarter of each year 
conversely  we typically experience a decline in both our net accounts receivable and sales driven accrued expenses during the first and second quarters of each year 
additionally  we normally increase our inventory levels during the third quarter in anticipation of higher sales during the third and fourth quarters 
we do not anticipate significant cash requirements for us federal income tax payments during due to existing  unutilized nol carryforwards we assumed when spiegel transferred ownership of its subsidiaries  fsac and sac  to us 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  covenants in our term loan agreement and revolving credit facility restrict our ability to pay dividends and may prohibit certain other payments

interest and principal payments related to our convertible notes assume no conversion prior to their scheduled maturity date in april as more fully described above under convertible notes  the holders of the convertible notes have rights which may cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding at certain dates in the future prior to their scheduled maturity date 
includes future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases for retail stores  corporate headquarters  call center and distribution facilities

table of contents includes open purchase orders with vendors for merchandise not yet received or recorded on our balance sheet 
includes facility related contracts  such as utility and telecommunication services  information technology contracts  printing services  and other miscellaneous business agreements 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we had million of letters of credit outstanding as of december  under our revolving credit facility 
see further discussion of our letters of credit under off balance sheet arrangements below 
other contractual obligations insurance and self insurance we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to cover a number of risks  including worker s compensation  general liability  property and automobile liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is reimbursed by our employees 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
we believe that we have taken reasonable steps to ensure that we are adequately accrued for costs incurred related to these programs at december  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations as established in the plan of reorganization  we assumed the spiegel pension and other post retirement plans as of the effective date of our emergence from bankruptcy 
prior to our emergence from bankruptcy  our employees participated in these plans and our combined financial statements reflected the expense benefit and liabilities associated with the portion of these plans related only to our employees 
accordingly  the liabilities associated with these plans  in addition to those liabilities related to our employees that were already reflected on our combined balance sheet  have been reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of and subsequent to july   our fresh start reporting date 
our funding obligations and liabilities under the terms of the plans are determined using certain actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually at the end of each third quarter  which is the period in which we have elected to use as our annual measurement date 
the third quarter measurement results are subsequently reflected in our fiscal year end financial statements 
effective december   we adopted sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires companies to i recognize in their statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  ii measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year and iii recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur via reporting them within other comprehensive income 
sfas does not change the amounts recognized in the statement of operations as net periodic benefit cost 
the new measurement date requirement will be effective for fiscal years ending after december  we assumed a discount rate of for our pension obligation and for our other post retirement obligations  as of september   our most recent measurement date  based upon an analysis of the moody s aa corporate bond rate 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our pension plan was derived from a study conducted by our actuaries and investment managers 
the study included a review of anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plan to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plan benefits 
while the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns  the assumption is primarily a long term  prospective rate 
based upon 
table of contents the most recent study  we have assumed a long term return of related to our pension assets as of the september  measurement date 
as of september   our most recent measurement date  our estimated unfunded pension obligation was approximately million and our estimated unfunded obligation related to the assumed post retirement benefit plans was million 
we made contributions of million and million to our post retirement benefit plans and pension plan  respectively  during fiscal our contributions to the post retirement benefit plans and pension plan are estimated to total million and  respectively  for fiscal during  the pension protection act of was enacted 
this regulation has not had a material impact on the funding obligations with respect to our pension and other benefit plans 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had million in outstanding stand by letters of credit 
we had no other off balance sheet financing arrangements as of december  we use stand by letters of credit to support our worker s compensation insurance and import customs bond programs 
letters of credit  primarily merchandise vendor letters of credit  are important to our operations because they allow us to have payment on our behalf guaranteed by a bank which then pays the vendor a given amount of money upon presentation of specific documents demonstrating that merchandise has shipped 
we subsequently record the payable to the vendor on our balance sheet at the time of merchandise title transfer 
we had no merchandise letters of credit outstanding as of december  we are not aware of any material risks to the availability of our letters of credit 
seasonality historically  our operations have been seasonal  with a disproportionate amount of net merchandise sales occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season 
during fiscal  the fourth fiscal quarter accounted for approximately of our net merchandise sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during the fourth fiscal quarter of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
the impact of seasonality on results of operations is more pronounced since the level of certain fixed costs  such as occupancy and overhead expenses  do not vary with sales 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of net merchandise sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments and relocations  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions 
accordingly  results for individual quarters are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
there are certain estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to them  as presented below 
the following represents the nature of and rationale for our critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition nature of critical estimate merchandise sales 
we recognize revenues and the related costs of sales related to our store sales at the time of sale when the customer pays for the merchandise 
for sales in our direct channels  including our catalog sales and sales through our internet sites  revenue and the related costs of sales are recognized when the product is estimated to be received by the customer 
sales returns 
we are required to make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales 
licensing revenues 
we have licensing arrangements with various consumer product manufacturers and other retailers 
in certain cases  our licensing revenues are based upon the net sales of the licensed products and therefore we are reliant on the licensee to provide us with their net sales 
at times  the net sales information for the licensed products is not available to us prior to the issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we are required to make an estimate of our licensing revenues 
assumptions approach used merchandise sales 
in order to properly state our revenues and related costs of sales related to sales in our direct channels  we defer revenue and costs of sales of goods estimated to be in transit to the customer based on our experience of delivery times of the carrier used 
sales returns 
we base our estimates for future sales returns on historical returns experience  taking into consideration current trends 
licensing revenue 
if net sales of the licensed product are not available  we estimate our licensing revenues based upon historical sales experience for the product and by obtaining estimated net sales data from the licensee 
effect if different assumptions used merchandise sales 
our revenue  costs of sales and gross margin would vary if different assumptions were used as to the estimated goods in transit to the customer 
our average daily sales from our direct channels for fiscal   and were million  million and million  respectively 
sales returns 
our revenue  costs of sales and gross margin would vary if different assumptions were used to estimate our sales returns 
our allowance for sales returns at the end of fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
licensing revenue 
our revenue related to our licensing agreements would vary if actual net sales for the licensed products turn out to be different than our estimates 
our licensing revenues for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation nature of critical estimate inventory valuation 
we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the weighted average cost method and includes certain overhead and internal freight costs capitalized to inventory 
market is determined based upon the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the estimated selling price of the merchandise 
we record reserves against our inventory balance for excess and slow moving inventory that are not expected to be sold at or above cost plus cost of disposal and a normal selling margin 

table of contents excess and slow moving inventories are typically disposed of through markdowns  sales in our outlet stores  or through liquidations 
assumptions approach used inventory valuation 
we base our estimated inventory reserves on historical experience related to the sale and amount of markdowns previously taken on similar categories of inventory  as well as taking into consideration the age of the inventory  inventory levels for the product  including additional outstanding purchase orders  anticipated methods of disposal and new  similar products expected to be sold 
effect if different assumptions used inventory valuation 
our results of operations in future periods could be negatively impacted if we fail to properly estimate the amount of write down of our inventory values 
our inventory valuation reserves at the end of fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets nature of critical estimate fair values of property and equipment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we review finite lived long lived assets  principally consisting of property and equipment and leasehold improvements at our stores  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
for assets we intend to hold and use  if the total expected future undiscounted cash flows from the asset group is less than the carrying amount of the asset group  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
for assets we plan to dispose of  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the assets in the disposal group is more than the fair value  net of the costs of disposal 
the impairment tests require us to estimate the undiscounted cash flows and fair value of the asset groups 
fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting of our trademarks and goodwill  based upon the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires us to test our goodwill and trademarks for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the intangible asset may be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment reviews for goodwill and trademarks during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment tests require us to estimate the fair value of our trademarks and our overall business enterprise value 
assumptions approach used fair values of property and equipment 
when analyzing finite  long lived assets for potential impairment  significant assumptions are used in determining the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group  including the cash flows attributed to the asset group  future cash flows of the asset group  including estimates of future growth rates  and the period of time in which the assets will be held and used or disposed of 
we primarily determine fair values of the asset group using discounted cash flow models 
similar assumptions are used to determine the fair value of the asset group as the assumptions used in the undiscounted cash flow model 
in addition  to estimate fair value we are required to estimate the discount rate that incorporates the time value of money and risk inherent in future cash flows 
fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets 
we estimate the fair value of our trademarks primarily using a discounted cash flow model 
we estimate the fair value of our overall business enterprise value using discounted cash flow and market multiple approach models  and also take into consideration our common stock price 
significant assumptions are used when determining the fair values of our trademarks and overall enterprise valuation  including future cash flows of our primary assets  our terminal value growth rates  and our weighted average cost of capital 
additionally  we are required to estimate the fair value of our non 
table of contents primary assets  which include our tax net operating losses and foreign joint ventures 
estimates of future cash flows are based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores  catalogs and internet sites  estimates of future profitability and economic conditions 
future estimates of profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to twenty years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability  are difficult to predict and in certain cases  beyond our control 
see further discussion of the impairment tests we performed during fiscal and fiscal above under results of operations impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
effect if different assumptions used fair values of property and equipment and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our undiscounted cash flow models could result in cash flows lower than the current carrying values of our asset groups  thereby requiring us to compare the carrying values of the asset groups to their fair value  which may have not been done using different assumptions 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow models could result in lower fair values of our property and equipment  trademarks  or overall business enterprise value which may result in the need to record further impairment charges  which may not have been done using different assumptions 
lastly  the use of a different method of determining fair value  other than using discounted cash flow and market multiple approach models  could result in lower or higher fair values 
deferred tax valuation allowances nature of critical estimate upon our emergence from bankruptcy on june   spiegel transferred ownership of its subsidiaries  fsac and sac  to us 
both fsac and sac have significant tax nols 
we are required to estimate the amount of tax valuation allowances to record against these nols based upon our assessment of it being more likely than not that these nols will expire or go unused 
assumptions approach used in determining the need for tax valuation allowances against our nols  we take into consideration current and past operating performance  projections of future operating results and projected taxable income or loss  timing of the reversal of our temporary tax differences  length of the carryback and carryforward periods  and any limitations imposed by the irc section section limits nol utilization based upon an entity s estimated enterprise value upon change in control 
we estimated our federal nols to be approximately million tax affected and our state nols to be approximately million tax affected as of july   our fresh start reporting date 
as of our fresh start reporting date  we concluded that it was more likely than not that our state nols would expire and go unused 
accordingly  in conjunction with our application of fresh start accounting effective july   a valuation allowance was established for the full estimated value million tax affected of our state nols 
as of our fresh start reporting date  we estimated that the full amount of our federal nols would be utilized and accordingly no valuation allowance was established 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our long range forecast which resulted in a decrease in estimated taxable income in future years and an increase in the amount of federal nols that would have expired and gone unused after considering the section limitations 
these changes resulted in a net million increase in the valuation allowance requirement during the six months ended december  during fiscal we recognized million of expense to further increase our valuation allowance related to our nols for several reasons 
first  we reassessed our long range plan  which resulted in a decrease in our projected taxable income during and and an increase in the projected amounts of nols expected to expire unused 
also  we performed an updated valuation of our enterprise value and concluded that our enterprise value had declined 
this decline in enterprise value resulted in a decrease in the amount of 
table of contents expected nol utilization allowed for the years of through  and correspondingly  an increase in the estimated amount of nols that would have expired and gone unused 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax expense of million to increase our valuation allowance related to our federal nols  resulting from several changes in circumstances during first  we determined that the additional restrictions on federal nol utilization under section resulting from the anticipated change in control upon expiration of the ownership limitations established within our certification of incorporation were no longer likely to occur 
we made this conclusion as a result of the terminated merger agreement which occurred in fiscal additionally  we had assumed that our board of directors would lift the ownership restrictions effective january   which did not occur 
accordingly  we used the original section limitation resulting from the bankruptcy related ownership change  and no longer assumed a second change in control upon the lapse of the ownership limitations  when determining the valuation allowance required as of december  this change resulted in a higher section limitation  allowing for increased nol utilization in the future 
also  in determining the amount of nol carryforwards that were more likely than not expected to be realized  we determined that we would take into account only our projected taxable income for the next three fiscal years 
we changed our assumption related to future years in which we could rely on having taxable income due to our recent history of book losses and taxable losses when excluding the taxable income generated by our financing receivables which we sold in december using these assumptions  we estimated that a valuation allowance of million was required as of december  related to our federal nols 
our federal nols as of december  were estimated to be approximately million tax affected and expire in through during the fourth quarter of  in the course of preparing our state income tax returns  we received additional information from our prior parent company  spiegel  related to certain state nols that existed as of our fresh start reporting date  which we had previously assumed a full valuation allowance against 
we recorded an adjustment to reduce goodwill by million during the fourth quarter which included million for nols utilized during the second half of fiscal and during fiscal with an offset to income tax expense  million for nols utilized during fiscal which was reflected in the company s fiscal state tax expense  and million for state nols which will be utilized in future years and not expire unused 
these adjustments were recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  if a valuation allowance is recognized for some portion or all of an acquired entities deferred tax assets for tax operating loss carryforwards at the acquisition date  tax benefits for those items recognized in financial statements for a subsequent year should first be applied to reduce any goodwill related to the acquisition 
additionally  we generated million of state nols during fiscal which we provided a full valuation allowance as we expect these state nols to expire unused 
our state nols as of december  were estimated to be approximately million tax affected  of which we had a valuation allowance of million  and expire in through effect if different assumptions used different assumptions as to our future profitability and taxable income or loss  including the number of years in which we base our estimate upon  could result in different conclusions as to our need for and the level of our tax valuation allowances related to our nols 
additionally  our analysis requires assumptions about the timing and amount of limitations imposed by section based upon our enterprise value and the potential for additional limitations resulting from the lapse of ownership restrictions within our plan of reorganization 
different estimates in our enterprise value could result in the need for additional valuation allowances 
changes in ownership upon the lapse of the trading restrictions no later than january  and related assumptions may also result in future changes in our valuation allowance requirements 
in the future  adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance related to the nols may increase or decrease our provision for income taxes and related tax payments which could be materially impacted as these nols are realized or expire unused 

table of contents stock based compensation nature of critical estimate we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r  which we adopted with our fresh start accounting date of july  prior to that date  we had no stock based compensation and accordingly  we were not required to select a transition method upon our adoption of sfas no 
r 
assumptions approach used in order to calculate our stock based compensation expense  with the assistance of a third party  we use the black scholes option pricing model for our time vested stock options and a monte carlo simulation model for our performance based stock options  which requires the use of subjective assumptions including volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
due to our limited stock price history  expected volatility is based upon historical and implied volatility for other companies in the retail industry 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase stock based compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date having a term equal to the expected term of the option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase stock based compensation expense 
expected term this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on estimated future exercise behavior 
an increase in the expected term will increase stock based compensation expense 
we currently estimate the weighted average expected option term for our stock options using the application of the simplified method set out in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and sab no 
the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
we will continue to utilize this simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
dividend yield this is assumed to be zero as we do not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease stock based compensation expense 
forfeitures we estimate forfeitures of stock based awards based on expected future activity and adjust our forfeiture rate on a quarterly basis as actual forfeitures occur 
an increase in forfeitures results in a decrease to stock based compensation expense  which is recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining term of the option grant 
effect if different assumptions used different estimates of the above items could result in higher or lower amounts of stock based compensation expense recognized 
our stock based compensation expense for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of derivative instruments nature of critical estimate we value certain embedded features within our convertible notes as derivative liabilities 
in accordance with sfas  the embedded derivative must be recorded at fair value and adjusted to fair value each quarter with differences in the fair value from quarter to quarter reflected in our results of operations 

table of contents assumptions approach used we calculate the fair value of our embedded derivative liability associated with the conversion features within our convertible notes primarily using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions including volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
due to our limited stock price history  expected volatility is based upon historical and implied volatility for other companies in the retail industry in addition to the volatility of our common stock 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury yield curve in effect as of the end of the quarter having a term equal to the expected term of the conversion option 
expected years to conversion this is the period of time over which the conversion options within the convertible notes are expected to remain outstanding 
effect if different assumptions used different estimates of the above items could result in higher or lower estimates of the fair value of our embedded derivative liability related to the conversion options at the end of each quarter 
accordingly  different fair values could result in increases or decreases in the amounts we recognize within other income  net 
we estimated the fair value of the conversion features to be million as of december  and accordingly recognized million within other income  net during fiscal inflation the rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our audited financial statements  which are included in this document  for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
related party transactions we had no material related party transactions during fiscal  or subsequent events see note to our audited financial statements  which are included in this document  for a discussion of material events occurring subsequent to december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposures to market risk relate to interest rates  changes in the value of our common stock and foreign exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage our interest rate risks 
we do not use any derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risks 
we do not use derivatives for trading purposes  to generate income or to engage in speculative activity 
market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our revolving credit facility  the amended term loan agreement which we entered into in april and the convertible notes we issued in april 
table of contents revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread 
as of december   our availability was approximately million and no amounts had been drawn under the senior secured revolving credit facility 
senior secured term loan on april   we amended and restated the prior term loan 
in connection with the amendment and restatement  million of the loans were prepaid  reducing the principal balance from million to million 
as of december   the outstanding amount of our amended term loan totaled million  of which million were in eurodollar loans and million were base rate loans 
interest on the amended term loan is calculated as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus one half of one percent plus in the case of base rate loans  or libor plus for eurodollar loans 
interest requirements for both base rate loans and eurodollar loans are reset on a monthly basis 
as of december   our amended term loan had an interest rate of libor of plus  for a total interest rate of for eurodollar loans and an interest rate of prime of plus  for a total interest rate of for base rate loans 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition sources of liquidity refinancing transaction for a more detailed description of our amended term loan agreement 
on april   we terminated our interest rate swap agreement that had been designated as a cash flow hedge of amended term loan 
we terminated the interest rate swap agreement as a result of the refinancing of our amended term loan on april  upon termination  we received million in settlement of the interest rate swap and recognized a gain of million within other income  net 
additionally  on april   we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement and designated the new interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of our refinanced million amended term loan which we executed on april  the new interest rate swap agreement had a notional amount of million as of december  and effectively converts a portion of the outstanding amount under the amended term loan  which has a floating rate of interest to a fixed rate by having us pay fixed rate amounts in exchange for the receipt of the amount of the floating rate interest payments 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  a monthly net settlement is made for the difference between the fixed rate of and the variable rate based upon the monthly libor rate on the notional amount of the interest rate swap 
the new interest rate swap agreement is scheduled to terminate in april assuming a increase in interest rates  the fair value of the new interest rate swap would be a liability of approximately million at december  assuming a decrease in interest rates  the fair value of the interest rate swap would be a liability of approximately million at december  convertible notes on april   we closed our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
the convertible notes have a maturity date of april  and pay interest at an annual rate of unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
market risk change in value of our common stock our convertible notes contain certain features that allow the holder to convert their notes into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain conditions 
see further discussion above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition sources of liquidity refinancing transaction for a detailed description of the terms of conversion 
the fair market value of the convertible notes is subject to market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes 
the fair market value of the convertible notes will generally increase as the market price of our common stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
as a result of the requirement that we settle any conversion of notes prior to the termination of the ownership limitations contained in our certificate of incorporation in cash  the conversion features contained 
table of contents within the convertible notes are deemed to be an embedded derivative under sfas in accordance with sfas  the embedded derivative related to the conversion features requires bifurcation from the debt component of the convertible notes and a separate valuation 
we recognize the embedded derivative as an asset or liability on our balance sheet and measure it at its estimated fair value  and recognize changes in its estimated fair value in other income  net in the period of change 
we determine the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative primarily using the black scholes model and other valuation methodologies which resulted in an estimated fair value of million as of the issuance date for the convertible notes 
the black scholes model and other valuation methodologies are complex and require significant judgments 
in applying the black scholes model  changes and volatility in our common stock price and the stock price of other comparable retailers and changes in risk free interest rates could significantly affect the fair value of this derivative instrument 
we estimated the fair value of the conversion features to be million as of december  and accordingly recognized million within other income  net during fiscal market risk foreign exchange our foreign currency risks relate primarily to stores that we operate in canada and with our investments in japan and germany  for which we apply the equity method of accounting as we do not control these entities 
additionally  we have foreign currency risks associated with the purchase of merchandise from foreign entities 
we believe that the potential exposure from foreign currency risks is not material to our financial condition or results of operations
