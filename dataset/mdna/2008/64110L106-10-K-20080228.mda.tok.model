we believe that the dvd format  along with its high definition successor formats  including blu ray  will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future and that by growing a large dvd subscription business  we will be well positioned to transition our subscribers and our business to internet based delivery of content if it becomes the preferred consumer medium for accessing content 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the key business metrics include the following churn churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions  then divided by three months 
management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions 
management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value

management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric

table of contents recent developments we believe that the dvd format  along with its high definition successor formats  including blu ray  will continue to be the main vehicle for watching content in the home for the foreseeable future 
we introduced a new feature in january that allows subscribers to instantly watch movies and television series on their pcs 
we intend to broaden the distribution capability of this feature to multiple platforms over time  and  as a result  in january we announced a development arrangement with lg electronics

in late  blockbuster launched its integrated store based and online program  total access  whereby blockbuster online subscribers may return dvds delivered to them from blockbuster online to blockbuster stores in exchange for an in store rental 
total access was aggressively priced and experienced rapid subscriber growth and large operating losses in the first half of in the second half of  blockbuster adopted a new competitive strategy which emphasized profitable growth 
as part of this new strategy  blockbuster reduced their marketing spending and raised prices on total access  which we believe contributed to an acceleration in our subscriber growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
amortization of content library and upfront costs we acquire content from studios and distributors through direct purchases  revenue sharing agreements or license agreements 
we acquire content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues  and  as such  we consider our content library to be a productive asset  and classify our content library as a non current asset 
additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  we classify cash outflows for the acquisition of the content library  net of changes in related accounts payable  as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
this is inclusive of any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 
we amortize our dvds  less estimated salvage value  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives 
the useful life of the new release dvds and back catalog dvds is estimated to be year and years  respectively 
in estimating the useful life of our dvds  we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 
volume purchase discounts received from studios on the purchase of titles are recorded as a reduction of dvd inventory when earned 
for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives  a salvage value of per dvd has been provided 
for those dvds that we do not expect to sell  no salvage value is provided 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvds 

table of contents under revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors  we generally obtain titles for a low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or a fee based on utilization over a fixed period of time  or the title term  which is typically between and months for each title 
at the end of the title term  we generally have the option of returning the dvd title to the studio  destroying the title or purchasing the title 
in addition  we remit an upfront payment to acquire titles from the studios and distributors under revenue sharing agreements 
this payment includes a contractually specified initial fixed license fee that is capitalized and amortized in accordance with our content library amortization policy 
in some cases  this payment also includes a contractually specified prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations that is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense and is charged to expense as future revenue sharing obligations are incurred 
we amortize license fees on internet based content on a straight line basis consistent with the terms of the license agreements 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r on january  under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
in the second quarter of  and restated prior periods at that time 
because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
r were materially consistent under our equity plans  the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we changed our method of calculating the fair value of new stock based compensation awards under our stock plans from a black scholes model to a lattice binomial model on january  we continue to use a black scholes option model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares 
the lattice binomial model has been applied prospectively to options granted subsequent to january  the lattice binomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s price volatility of the underlying stock 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
expected volatility our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock 
suboptimal exercise factor our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted  and is determined for both executives and non executives 
we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis 
we have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately 
as a result of immediate vesting  stock based compensation expense determined under sfas no 
r is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas no 
r disclosures 

table of contents income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
at december   our deferred tax assets were million 
as of december   deferred tax assets did not include the tax benefits attributable to approximately million of excess tax deductions related to stock options 
in  these benefits were realized as a reduction of taxes payable and credited to equity 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  and our forecast of future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination
