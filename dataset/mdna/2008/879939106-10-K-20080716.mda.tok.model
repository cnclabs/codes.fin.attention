r share based payment  and related interpretations  mistakes were made in the accounting for our equity compensation grants during the period reviewed

as a result  we recorded additional equity based compensation expense for financial accounting purposes under apb and sfas r  resulting in a pre tax  non cash cumulative charge of million million on an after tax basis in our consolidated financial statements through june  the majority of adjustments affected periods prior to background on september   the audit committee of our board of directors initiated an independent review of our historical equity based compensation practices and the related accounting the review 
we commenced this review on our own initiative and not in response to any governmental or regulatory investigation  shareholder lawsuit  whistleblower complaint or inquiries from the media 

table of contents the review  conducted by the audit committee over a period of approximately five months  included the following tasks  among others reviewing hard copy and electronic files obtained from us as well as other sources that totaled hundreds of thousands of pages of hard copy and electronic documents  conducting interviews of past and present employees  officers and directors  some of whom were interviewed more than once  engaging outside consultants to conduct various statistical analyses of our equity awards  reviewing board and committee minutes and related materials from through august  reviewing actions by unanimous written consent uwcs and other granting actions relating to equity awards from through august  reviewing our public filings and equity compensation plans  frequent communications by the chairman of the audit committee with the audit committee s independent counsel and its accounting consultants  and numerous telephonic and in person meetings of the audit committee 
we placed no restrictions on the audit committee in connection with the review  and we cooperated fully with the review 
under the oversight of the audit committee and in consultation with our current and former independent auditors  management conducted its own internal review of our historical equity based compensation practices and related accounting over a period of approximately nine months 
our review covered  equity awards  including  equity awards from our ipo in through august and pre ipo grants for subsequent modifications  cancellations  and other accounting issues 
the equity awards  which comprised approximately million stock options and approximately million restricted stock units  were granted as annual incentives to employees  in connection with hiring new employees  promotions  or whose performance warranted the award  and to directors and certain consultants 
this internal review  which was a necessary step in the preparation of our restated consolidated financial statements  included  among other things  evaluations of our previous accounting for grants of equity based compensation as described more fully below 
historical equity based compensation practices from through august  we made the following types of equity based compensation grants to directors  section officers  employees and consultants annual pool grants in conjunction with our annual merit review process  which generally occurred within a few months following our year end referred to as annual grants  individual grants to newly hired or promoted section officers and employees and  from time to time  grants in recognition of performance or as incentives  options granted or assumed in connection with acquisitions  and options granted to non employee directors and  from time to time  consultants 
as previously disclosed in our current report on form k filed with the sec on february   the audit committee s review included the following findings  among others there was no willful misconduct in connection with our equity compensation granting process 
there was no evidence of improper conduct by the chairman and chief executive officer  the vice chairman  any current member of senior management  any past or present member of the compensation committee  or any other outside director 

table of contents there was no regular or systematic practice of using hindsight to select grant dates and no pattern of consistently hitting lows 
other findings  mostly related to periods prior to  which we believe should be viewed within the context of the report s finding of no willful misconduct  include certain employees officers involved in the administration of our stock options  none of which are actively employed by us  did not adequately meet all of the demands of their positions and or did not adequately appreciate their responsibilities in the stock option granting process  particularly in the period prior to there were control and other deficiencies in our equity compensation granting process 
our policies were not sufficient to ensure compliance with all applicable accounting and disclosure rules relevant to equity compensation 
there were episodic instances of selecting grant dates with some hindsight 
there was some evidence that certain employees officers involved in selecting grant dates  none of which are actively employed by us  had some understanding of the accounting implications of selecting dates with hindsight 
however  there was no conclusive evidence demonstrating that those involved in selecting dates knowingly and or purposely violated accounting or disclosure rules 
there were instances where we failed to appreciate that certain required granting actions needed to be completed before a measurement date for a grant could be established under applicable equity compensation accounting rules 
certain stock option awards were not properly recorded under applicable equity compensation accounting rules  including in connection with modification of grants  a recipient s status as a consultant or an employee  and treatment of performance based vesting conditions 
delegation of authority the audit committee s review noted that  by the terms of our various stock option plans as amended and restated from time to time  the compensation committee was vested with the authority to administer and grant stock options under the plans 
the review found that for the period from august to december  no documentation existed delegating the authority to make grants from the compensation committee to management 
for the period december through december  although the audit committee found that there was a documented delegation of authority to management  there were variations in the practices utilized when management made awards and the company regularly followed the practice of obtaining approval or ratification by the compensation committee of awards issued based on management actions 
given these circumstances  there was some uncertainty as to whether such awards were final and effective prior to the time when the compensation committee acted on the awards 
the audit committee found that a change in the company s procedures including a formalization of the delegation to management was made in december as a result  for the period december through august  this uncertainty was eliminated 
management conducted a thorough review of how the delegation of authority operated in practice and as understood by those who were involved in the process during the period through for the period through  management concluded that there was an implied delegation of authority from the compensation committee to management to grant stock options within certain pre established parameters 
these parameters were modified in december to require explicit compensation 
table of contents committee approval for all grants to section officers and for all grants greater than  shares 
these parameters remained unchanged through the remainder of the period reviewed 
management s conclusions on delegation of authority are based on  among other things  information obtained from past and present officers and directors  including members of the compensation committee  indicating that they believed that management was provided with the authority within certain stated limitations to make grants  and management  in fact  in making grants acted consistently with such understanding 
our review of employee files  emails and other available and relevant information indicated that grants were generally approved by management through offer letters to new employees and through signed personnel forms or email communications for promotional grants 
for annual pool grants  the compensation committee approved the total number of shares to be included in the pool while management was delegated the authority to allocate the pool to the individual grant recipients 
this allocation was evidenced by a list of grant recipients provided by human capital who administered the process 
in addition  our review noted that while it was our practice to provide the compensation committee with a quarterly monitoring report indicating grants of equity during the previous quarter and for the compensation committee to act on the grants  there were no instances where the compensation committee changed any grant that was approved by management 
the compensation committee s quarterly action was not considered by the compensation committee or the officers who acted on the grants as required for the grants to be given effect 
as a result  we have concluded that the finalization of management approval generally represented the point in time when the number of options and the exercise price of the option were first known with finality and  therefore  was the appropriate date at which to establish a measurement date as required under apb upon further consideration based on the information provided in management s review and analysis  the audit committee concurred with management s conclusions that while explicit  documented delegation of authority did not exist for the entire period under review  an effective implied delegation of authority from the compensation committee to management did exist for the period through november measurement dates during all periods reviewed  we typically dated new hire or promotional grants on the first date of employment or the effective date of promotion 
we did note that during the period august through december  it was the occasional practice for offers of employment to include an exercise price based upon the date of the employee s offer letter and the grant was dated on the same date as of the offer letter regardless of the employee s first date of employment 
the dating practices as outlined above applied to both employees and section officers 
for annual pool grants  the grants were dated on the date the pool was approved by the compensation committee or on a date selected by management within the parameters established by the compensation committee 
grants to our directors were dated typically on the automatic dates prescribed in the applicable stock option plan 
consultant grants were typically dated on the first date of their service to the company 
we found that the evidence available to determine the date on which final management approval for the grant was obtained sometimes varied 
in cases where the evidence related to the grant was limited  we reviewed all of the available information including the date the grant record was created in our equity grant tracking system which was in some cases the only contemporaneous dating evidence available 
in situations where there was only limited evidence as to the approval of the grant  we first reviewed grants made on the same date to assess whether the grant was part of another granting action and  if not  we reviewed the date that the grant was communicated to the employee 
if there was no other information available  we assigned a measurement date to the grant as of the record creation date in our equity grant tracking system 

table of contents equity based compensation expense adjustments as presented in the table below and discussed more fully below  as a result of the findings in the audit committee s review and through management s own review  we determined that material equity based compensation expense adjustments were required primarily for the following reasons  among others measurement date mistakes were made in connection with annual pool grants where the allocation of the grants to individual recipients was not known with finality until after the stated grant date  measurement date mistakes were made on new hire and promotional grants to section officers  employees and non employee directors as a result of delayed or missing approvals and grants made prior to the start date  certain stock option awards were modified after the establishment of a measurement date to accelerate the vesting of the employees stock options or to allow the exercise of stock options beyond the standard day period following termination of employment  and certain grants previously accounted for as employee awards were determined to have been made for non employee consulting services and should have been accounted for under sfas no

the following table summarizes the impact of these adjustments for the accounting periods presented amounts in thousands pre tax equity based compensation expense measurement modifications to non employee year endend december  date changes employee grants grants other total cumulative effect at december  first quarter second quarter total measurement date adjustments for the years through  we accounted for our equity based compensation grants under apb and determined the required disclosures pursuant to the provisions of sfas under apb  it is necessary to recognize equity based compensation expense for stock options having intrinsic value on the dates such options are granted 
as used in this discussion  the measurement date for a particular option is the date all required granting actions for an option are completed and is therefore the date on which the value of the option should be determined for accounting purposes 
the valuation is based on the closing stock price on such measurement date 
we set the exercise price of our options at the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
if the grant date is not the same as the required measurement date for an option  intrinsic value can arise if the closing stock price on the grant date was less than the closing stock price on the measurement date 
the difference between the exercise 
table of contents price established as of the grant date and the closing stock price on the measurement date is viewed as built in gain in the value of the option that exists on the measurement date  for which an equity based compensation expense is required to be recognized 
on january   we adopted sfas r under the modified prospective method 
for the measurement date revisions  we revised our historical pro forma footnote disclosures in accordance with sfas additionally  we adjusted our consolidated financial statements and the first two quarters of to reflect the impact of revised measurement dates on the compensation expense recognized in accordance with sfas r 
we identified  grants for which we used incorrect measurement dates for financial accounting purposes  of which grants comprising approximately million shares resulted in accounting adjustments related to revised measurement dates 
for options accounted for under apb  if the exercise price was less than the closing price on the revised measurement date  we recorded an adjustment to recognize equity based compensation expense for the intrinsic value of such equity awards over the vesting period of the award 
for options accounted for under sfas r  we calculated the fair value of the award on the revised measurement date and recorded an adjustment for the revised fair value of each award over the vesting period 
to determine the correct measurement dates for these grants under applicable accounting principles  we followed the guidance in apb  which deems the measurement date to be the first date on which all of the following facts are known with finality i the identity of the individual employee who is entitled to receive the option grant  ii the number of options that the individual employee is entitled to receive  and iii the option s exercise price 
the documents and information considered in connection with our adjustments to measurement dates included  among other things board and committee meeting minutes and related materials  evidence relating to the dates uwcs were prepared and circulated for signature and or signed by compensation committee members  personnel files of employees who were granted options  e mail communications and other electronic files from our computer system and in back up media  documentation relating to the allocation of annual grants to individual employees  information as to the respective hire dates of employees receiving the option grants  including if the grant was a new hire grant the date of any offer letter  correspondence  memoranda and other documentation supporting option grants  information concerning the dates that stock options were entered into our or our third party administrator s stock option tracking systems  and information obtained from current and former officers  directors  employees and outside professionals 

table of contents we reviewed each of the grant types described in the tables below to identify the required granting actions for each grant type and we determined  on a grant by grant basis  the appropriate measurement date based upon all of the relevant and available information associated with the grant

during this period   grants totaling approximately million options were granted 
the number of options authorized for any year was approved by the compensation committee generally in the first quarter of that year 
the exercise prices of these grants were established utilizing various methods including the date of the compensation committee meeting during which the award pool was established 
in some cases  however  the compensation committee specifically delegated to management the ability to set the grant date based upon an approved date range 
in the majority of the grants  the evidence suggests that the allocation of the grants were not final until sometime in the third quarter of each respective year 
all annual pool grants have been assigned revised measurement dates 
new hire  promotional and merit grants to employees we made  grants totaling approximately million shares to non section employees who were hired  promoted or whose performance warranted the award from through june we have determined that certain grants to employees were made prior to the completion of all of the required granting actions 
accordingly  we revised the measurement dates of grants totaling approximately million stock options 
new hire  promotional and merit grants to section officers we made grants totaling approximately million shares to section officers who were hired  promoted or whose performance warranted the award from through june we have determined that certain grants to section officers were granted prior to the completion of all of the required granting actions including as appropriate approval by the compensation committee or the board 
furthermore  the delays in the completion of all required granting actions were often the result of the use of uwcs where the final approval was not received until after the stated grant date the effective date of the uwc 
accordingly  we revised the measurement dates of grants representing approximately million options awarded to newly hired or promoted section officers 
neither our chairman and chief executive officer nor our vice chairman have ever exercised any options granted to them 
grants made to employees of acquired companies from through  we made grants totaling approximately million options to employees of companies we acquired 
grants made in conjunction with acquisitions were typically authorized at the time of the board s approval of the acquisition 
the exercise price of such option grants was typically set at the closing stock price of our common stock on the closing date of the acquisition or in some cases approximately days after the acquisition 
we have concluded that in some cases  all of the required granting actions necessary for 
table of contents valid approval of these grants had not been completed as of the grant dates 
as a result  we revised the measurement dates of grants representing approximately million options 
non employee director grants from through june  we made grants to non employee directors totaling approximately million options 
we revised the measurement dates for certain of these grants because they were awarded on dates other than the automatic dates prescribed in the applicable stock option plan 
grants to consultants we made grants totaling approximately million options to consultants  three of which were made to directors of the board for services unrelated to their board service 
one grant to a consultant was modified after the initial grant date 
to correctly account for these grants in accordance with sfas and eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  we recorded million of compensation expense 
modifications to employee grants our review also identified a number of instances where modifications to stock options were made on terms beyond the limitations specified in the original terms of the grants  resulting in additional compensation expense 
modifications were made to stock options issued in annual pool grants  new hire and promotional grants to section officers and employees and grants made to employees of acquired companies 
the modifications included the following  among others severance agreements offered to certain terminated employees that allowed for continued vesting and the right to exercise stock options beyond the standard time period permitted under the terms of the stock option agreement  employment agreements that provided for the accelerated vesting of stock options  continued vesting and the ability to exercise stock options for certain employees not terminated from our database in a timely manner following their departure from teletech due to administrative errors  and options granted to certain employees that were not entered into our equity tracking system until after their dates of termination  primarily due to administrative delays in processing stock option requests and the lack of communication of employee termination dates to our third party plan administrator 
impact of the mistakes on our financial statements we have determined that after accounting for forfeitures  the adjustments described above resulted in an understatement of equity based compensation expense  which was allocated among the applicable accounting periods based on the respective vesting terms of the corrected option grants 
most of the adjusted measurement dates involved grants made prior to 
table of contents the following table reflects the impact of the equity based compensation restatement adjustments on our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented below amounts in thousands pre tax equity based net charge compensation income to net year ended december  expense taxes income cumulative effect at december  first quarter second quarter total tax consequences under internal revenue code as a result of the review of our equity based compensation practices  we have determined that a number of our historical equity based grants were issued with exercise prices that were below the quoted market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
under internal revenue code section a  grant recipients with stock options with exercise prices below the quoted market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after december  are subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant 
based on the review of our equity based compensation practices  we have determined that certain option grants exercised by our employees in and or outstanding as of december   may be subject to the adverse tax consequences under section a depending on the vesting provisions of each grant 
while the final regulations under section a were not effective until january   transition rules published by the irs in various notices and announcements make the principles of section a applicable  to varying degrees  during the tax years and in general  any exercise during and of a stock option vesting after december   granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the measurement date is subject to the provisions of section a 
additionally  in the one case of a stock option granted to an employee who was also a section officer at the time of grant  with an exercise price less than the fair market value on the measurement date  section a treats all vested and unexercised stock options as exercised at december  the section officer realized gross income  subject to both regular income and employment taxes along with the taxes imposed under section a  based on the difference between the fair market value of teletech stock on december  and the exercise price of the stock option 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified that there would be adverse tax consequences for employees who exercised stock options from these grants during and in december of  we committed to compensate our employees for the adverse tax consequences of section a and who  as a result  incurred or are otherwise subject to taxes and penalties 
in that regard  we have made  or will make  cash payments estimated at million to or on behalf of these individuals for the incremental taxes imposed under section a and an associated tax gross up as a result of the tax 
table of contents payment itself being taxable to the employee 
this amount was recorded as selling  general  and administrative expense in our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of when we elected to reimburse our employees for their incremental taxes 
with the final regulations effective january   employees holding unexercised stock options potentially subject to section a will be treated the same as section officers and lose the deferral of income typically associated with a stock option 
unexercised stock options potentially subject to section a will violate the provisions on january  if they are already vested or upon their future vesting 
an employee would then realize gross income  subject to income taxes and employment taxes as well as the taxes imposed under section a  based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock at december  for unexercised options or the actual gain realized for options exercised in 
in  we intend to provide all eligible employees with the opportunity to remedy their outstanding stock options that are subject to potential penalties under section a 
the resulting financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the remedial action is finalized 
we have also considered the impact of section m on and prior periods 
section m of the internal revenue code imposes a million annual limit on the compensation deduction permitted by a public company employer for compensation paid to its chief executive officer and its other officers whose compensation is required to be reported to stockholders under the securities exchange act of because they are among the four most highly compensated officers for the taxable year 
generally  this will include the chief executive officer ceo and the three highest paid officers other than the ceo  but will exclude the chief financial officer 
one significant exception is that compensation in excess of million annually is deductible provided the compensation meets the performance based exception requirements 
typically  stock options awarded at fair market value under a shareholder approved plan meet the performance based exception in regulation section normally  stock options granted by us under our equity based compensation plans meet the performance based compensation exception 
however  any income realized under a misdated stock option an option issued at less than fair market value on the relevant measurement date is deemed in whole to be non performance based compensation 
we have accounted for nondeductible employee compensation as limited by section m in and all prior periods in the restatement 
where compensation expense has been recorded with respect to a misdated stock option in or prior periods and the employee s compensation expense will likely be subject to section m when deducted for tax purposes in or future accounting periods  we have recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset where we believe realization of the deferred tax asset does not meet the more likely than not standard of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
this valuation allowance was established in the first quarter of and is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the expected future deductibility of these expenses 
also  to the extent employees subject to section m  in and prior periods exercised misdated stock options  the amounts realized have been accounted for as non performance based compensation expense subject to the million limitation 
judgments as discussed above  some of the revised measurement dates could not be determined with certainty 
as a result  we established revised measurement dates based on judgments that we made considering all of the available relevant information 
judgments different from ours regarding the timing of the revised measurement dates would have resulted in compensation expense charges different than those recorded by us in the restatement 
because of their potential variability  we prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine a hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that could occur if different judgments were utilized to determine the revised measurement dates 
in reviewing all available data including information  findings and conclusions from the audit committee s review and our own review  we considered other possible alternative measurement dates within a reasonable minimum and maximum range that might have been used in the preparation of a sensitivity analysis 
in this process  we found nothing that we believed would have supported conclusions that any other form or 
table of contents content for a sensitivity analysis would be more appropriate or helpful than the sensitivity analysis that we have prepared 
we applied our sensitivity methodology on a grant by grant basis using the largest reasonably possible variations in equity based compensation expense within a range of possible approval dates for each grant event 
we developed this range by starting with the first available dating evidence through the earlier of final management approval or the record creation date of the grant in our equity accounting system 
in some cases  the earliest possible date was the stated date of grant  while for others it was based on the documentary evidence  including  among other things  the employment offer letters  acquisition documents  board or board committee meeting dates  uwc dates  facsimile and e mail dates  electronic and printed dating evidence on grant recommendation listings  and creation dates in our equity accounting system 
based upon all available evidence  we were unable to identify dates that would provide a more reasonable range of dates for this sensitivity analysis 
while we believe the evidence and methodology used to determine the revised measurement dates to be the most appropriate  we also believe that illustrating differences in equity based compensation expense using these alternative date ranges provides some insight into the extent to which hypothetical equity based compensation expense would have fluctuated had we used other dates 
after developing the range for each grant event  we selected the highest closing price of our stock within the range and calculated the equity based compensation expense to determine the maximum possible compensation expense 
we then selected the lowest closing price within the range and calculated the equity based compensation expense to determine the minimum possible compensation expense 
we compared these aggregated amounts to the equity based compensation expense that we recorded 
if we had used the highest closing price of our stock within the range for each grant  our total restated equity based compensation expense relating to the revision in measurement dates would have increased to approximately million 
conversely  had we used the lowest closing price of our stock within the range for each grant  our total restated compensation expense would have decreased to approximately million 
our hypothetical ranges of equity based compensation expense were affected by the high level of volatility in our stock price and the date ranges used in our sensitivity analysis  generally the time period between the original grant dates of certain stock options and the revised measurement dates 
for example  in the year in our restatement period with the largest sensitivity range based on option grant date  our stock price closed at a low of per share and a high of per share during the range of potential alternative measurement dates 
since we do not have evidence that the grant dates and exercise prices were selected on the date when our stock price was at its highest or lowest during each period  we concluded that selecting a revised measurement date on the highest or lowest closing price when measuring compensation expense would not have been consistent with the requirements of apb  which looks to the first date on which the terms of the grants were fixed with finality 

table of contents the following table sets forth the effect on earnings before income taxes net of estimated forfeitures that would have resulted from using different alternate measurement dates as compared to the measurement dates selected in our evaluation and used for accounting purposes 
the table below illustrates the actual amortization of the pre tax equity based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements and the hypothetical equity based compensation expense in the period that the options are earned 
pre tax sensitivity analysis amounts in thousands hypothetical hypothetical equity based equity based equity based compensation equity based total equity compensation compensation expense compensation based expense at expense at previously expense compensation lowest highest recorded adjustments expense closing price closing price pre ipo through cumulative effect at december  first quarter second quarter totals lease accounting as part of our internal audit process  we identified the incorrect recording of certain leases under sfas no 
accounting for leases 
in addition  we incorrectly applied sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas to certain leases when it became effective in specifically  we did not correctly identify capital versus operating leases for certain of our delivery centers and improperly accounted for certain relevant contractual provisions  including lease inducements  construction allowances  rent holidays  escalation clauses  lease commencement dates and asset retirement obligations 
the lease classification changes and recognition of other lease provisions resulted in an adjustment to deferred rent  the recognition of appropriate asset retirement obligations  and the amortization of the related leasehold improvement assets 
we recorded a pre tax  non cash cumulative charge of million in our consolidated financial statements through june  to reflect these additional lease related expenses 
other accounting adjustments we made other corrections to accounts receivable and related revenue  accruals and related expense  as well as adjustments to reclassify restricted cash in a foreign entity to other assets 
the adjustments resulted in a net reduction of other expenses of million in our consolidated financial statements through june  income tax adjustments and income tax payables the reduction of million to the provision for income taxes reflects a million tax benefit from the pre tax accounting changes and a million tax benefit from permanent tax and foreign rate differences 
these benefits are offset in part by a million increase in the provision for income taxes 
table of contents due to changes in our deferred tax valuation allowances and a million tax increase for other adjustments restating the amount or period in which income taxes were originally recorded 
there is no material change to our income taxes payable to the us or any foreign tax jurisdiction nor will we be entitled to a tax refund due to the accounting adjustments recorded for equity based compensation expense during this restatement 
in accounting for equity based compensation  we only record a tax deduction when a stock option is exercised 
the tax returns filed during these periods correctly reported a windfall tax deduction on stock options exercised as measured by the gain realized on exercise of the stock option exercise price less the strike price of the option in excess of the book expense recorded with respect to the particular stock option exercised 
an increase to the book expense recorded for a particular stock option will have a corresponding decrease to the windfall tax deduction realized on exercise of the stock option but result in no overall increase or decrease to the total tax deductions taken with respect to the stock options exercised 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets recorded during the restatement will result in a future tax deduction was evaluated under the more likely than not criteria of sfas in making this judgment we evaluated all available evidence  both positive and negative  in order to determine if  or to what extent  a valuation allowance is required 
changes to our recorded deferred tax assets are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurred 
cost of restatement we have incurred substantial expenses for accounting  legal  tax and other professional services in connection with the audit committee s review  our internal review  and preparation of our consolidated financial statements and restated consolidated financial statements and related matters 
these third party expenses  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were million in  and are expected to be approximately million in in addition  in the quarter ended december  we recorded additional compensation expense of million for incremental federal  state and employment taxes  assessed upon employees under section a  including penalties  interest and tax gross ups 
we have committed to make the employees whole for any adverse tax consequences arising as a result of the vesting or exercise of mispriced options in and cost of securities class action lawsuits two class action lawsuits  which have now been consolidated  have been filed against us  certain directors and officers and others  alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
the complaints allege  among other things  false and misleading statements in i a registration statement and prospectus relating to a march secondary offering of common stock  and ii various periodic reports filed with the sec between february  and november  although we expect the majority of expenses related to the class action lawsuits to be covered by insurance  there can be no assurance that all of such expenses will be reimbursed 
regulatory inquiries related to historical equity based compensation practices the audit committee s independent counsel has met and discussed the results of the review with the staff of the sec 
furthermore  the irs is conducting an inquiry of the tax implications of our historical equity based compensation practices 
the sec and irs are reviewing the audit committee s findings and may pursue inquiries of their own  which could lead to further investigations and regulatory action 
at this time  we cannot predict what  if any  actions by the sec  the irs or any other regulatory authority or agency may result from the audit committee s review 
we can provide no assurances that there will be no additional inquiries or proceedings by the sec  the irs or other regulatory authorities or agencies 

table of contents nasdaq delisting proceedings we did not timely file with the sec our form q for the quarters ended september  and march  in addition to this form k as a result of the audit committee s and our own review of our historical equity based compensation practices and the resulting restatements of previously issued financial statements 
as a result  we received three nasdaq staff determination notices  dated november   march  and may   stating that we are not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c and  therefore  we are subject to potential delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
we appealed the nasdaq staff s delisting notice dated november  and  ultimately  the nasdaq listing and hearing review council requested that we provide an update on our efforts to file the delayed periodic reports by may  we provided that update on may  upon the filing of this form k and our quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended september  and march   we believe we will return to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements 
amendment of credit facility since november  we have entered into three amendments to our amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of september  the credit facility  with our lenders 
these amendments extended the time for us to deliver our financial statements for the quarter ended september   for the year ended december  and for the quarter ended march   until august  in the amendments  our lenders also consented to i the filing of our delayed periodic reports with the sec by august   ii the restatement of our previously filed financial statements  and iii the nasdaq staff determination notices with respect to the possible delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market due to the delayed periodic reports 
as a result of these amendments and the filing of the delayed periodic reports  there is presently no basis for our lenders to declare an event of default under our credit facility and we may continue to borrow funds thereunder

business overview we serve our clients through two primary businesses  bpo and database marketing and consulting 
our bpo business provides outsourced business process and customer management services for a variety of industries through global delivery centers and represents approximately of total annual revenue 
in september  we sold  through newgen results corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary  and related companies hereinafter collectively referred to as newgen  substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of this business which represented our entire database marketing and consulting business 
as a result  in  our bpo business will represent of total annual revenue 
when we begin operations in a new country  we determine whether the country is intended to primarily serve us based clients  in which case we include the country in our north american bpo segment  or if the country is intended to serve both domestic clients from that country and us based clients  in which case we include the country in our international bpo segment 
this is consistent with our management of the 
table of contents business  internal financial reporting structure and operating focus 
operations for each segment of our bpo business are conducted in the following countries north american bpo international bpo united states argentina canada australia philippines brazil china costa rica england germany malaysia mexico new zealand northern ireland scotland singapore south africa spain on june   we acquired percent of the outstanding common shares of direct alliance corporation dac  a provider of e commerce  professional sales and account management solutions primarily to fortune companies that sell into and maintain long standing relationships with small and medium businesses 
this acquisition was consistent with our strategy to grow and focus on providing outsourced marketing  sales and bpo solutions to large multinational clients 
dac is included in our north american bpo segment 
the acquisition of dac contributed approximately million of revenue to our consolidated results during the last six months of and million during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 
on december   we completed the sale of customer solutions mauritius  an indirect subsidiary that owned a interest in our teletech services india ltd 
joint venture 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this disposition 
on september   newgen results corporation and related companies hereinafter collectively referred to as newgen and teletech entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our database marketing and consulting business 
the transaction was completed on september  this business  which only represented of our revenue in  provided outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer acquisitions and retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers in north america 
during  our income from operations was reduced by million related to asset impairment and restructuring charges for this business 
during  our income from operations before income taxes and minority interest was reduced by million 
this includes the million of asset impairment and restructuring charges discussed above along with a million net charge related to the above disposal 
the disposal charge includes a loss on the sale of assets of million partially offset by software license income of million recorded in other  net

bpo services the bpo business generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our associates devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries automotive  cable and communications  financial services  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  
table of contents technology  travel and wireline and wireless telecommunications 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is from multi year contracts and we expect it will continue to be 
however  we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis 
we have historically experienced annual attrition of existing client programs of approximately to of our revenue 
attrition of existing client programs during was 
however  we experienced annual net growth of existing client programs of and in and  respectively growth of existing client programs was greater than the attrition of existing client programs 
we believe this trend is attributable to our investment in an account management and operations team focused on client service 
our invoice terms with clients typically range from to days  with longer terms in spain 
the bpo industry is highly competitive 
we compete primarily with the in house business processing operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide bpo on an outsourced basis 
our ability to sell our existing services or gain acceptance for new products or services is challenged by the competitive nature of the industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell services to new clients  renew relationships with existing clients  or gain client acceptance of our new products 
we have improved our revenue and profitability in both the north american and the international bpo segments by capitalizing on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to adopt or increase bpo services  consolidate outsourcing providers with those that have a solid financial position  capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  and better integrate front and back office processes 
deepening and broadening relationships with existing clients  winning business with new clients and focusing on targeted high growth industry verticals  continuing to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings such as professional services  talent acquisition  learning services and our hosted teletech ondemand tm capabilities  increasing capacity utilization during peak and non peak hours  scaling our work from home initiative to increase operational flexibility  and completing select acquisitions that extend our core bpo capabilities or vertical expertise 
our ability to renew or enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our clients operate 
a weakening of the us or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our potential clients typically obtain bids from multiple vendors and evaluate many factors in selecting a service provider  including  among other factors  the scope of services offered  the service record of the vendor and price 
we generally price our bids with a long term view of profitability and  accordingly  we consider all of our fixed and variable costs in developing our bids 
we believe that our competitors  at times  may bid business based upon a short term view  as opposed to our longer term view  resulting in a lower price bid 
while we believe our clients perceptions of the value we provide results in our being 
table of contents successful in certain competitive bid situations  there are often situations where a potential client may prefer a lower cost 
our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our delivery centers are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training time required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
as discussed above  our profitability is influenced  in part  by the number of new or expanded client programs 
we defer revenue for the initial training that occurs upon commencement of a new client contract start up training if that training is billed separately to the client 
accordingly  the corresponding training costs  consisting primarily of labor and related expenses  are also deferred 
in these circumstances  both the training revenue and costs are amortized straight line over the life of the contract 
in situations where start up training is not billed separately  but rather included in the production rates paid by the client over the life of the contract  there is no deferral as all revenue is recognized over the life of the contract and the associated training expenses are expensed as incurred 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million  respectively  of training expenses for client programs for which we did not separately bill start up training 
for programs that we have billed the client separately for training  the net impact of deferred start up training new deferrals less recognition of previous amounts deferred on our reported revenue for the years ended december  and was million and a decrease of million  respectively 
correspondingly  the net impact on our reported cost of services from these deferrals was an increase of million for the year ended december  and a decrease of million for the year ended december  the net impact of these deferrals on our reported income from operations for the years ended december  and was a decrease of million and million  respectively 
the impact from these deferrals decreased significantly in as the new amounts deferred during the period were consistent with the revenue recognized from prior deferrals 
in contrast  during  new deferrals for start up training were almost twice the revenue recognized from prior period deferrals due to growth in new client programs during the period and the clients agreement to pay for this training separately 
as of december   we had deferred start up training revenue  net of deferred costs  of million that will be recognized into our income from operations over the remaining life of the corresponding contracts approximately months 
we may have difficulties managing the timeliness of launching new or expanded client programs and the associated internal allocation of personnel and resources 
this could cause slower than anticipated revenue growth and or higher than expected costs primarily related to hiring  training and retaining the required workforce  either of which could adversely affect our operating results 
quarterly  we review our capacity utilization and projected demand for future capacity 
in conjunction with these reviews  we may decide to consolidate or close under performing delivery centers  including those impacted by the loss of a major client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in addition  because clients may request that we serve their customers from international delivery centers with lower prevailing labor rates  in the future we may decide to close one or more of our delivery centers  even though it is generating positive cash flow  because we believe the future profits from conducting such work outside the current delivery center may more than compensate for the one time charges related to closing the facility 
our profitability is influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our delivery centers 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new delivery centers or the expansion of existing delivery centers 
as such  management 
table of contents considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations  or expansions of existing programs and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
as a result  we expanded our capacity in by approximately  gross workstations in primarily offshore locations including the philippines and latin america 
these gross additions were partially offset by workstation reductions primarily related to the sale of our indian joint venture and database marketing and consulting business 
to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute a client contract as we concentrate our marketing efforts toward obtaining large  complex bpo programs 
we internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was 
the table below presents workstation data for our multi client centers as of december  and dedicated and managed centers  workstations are excluded from the workstation data as unused workstations in these facilities are not available for sale 
our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
we may change the designation of shared or dedicated centers based on the normal changes in our business environment and client needs 
december  december  total total production in production in workstations in use use workstations in use use north american bpo international bpo total as shown above  there was an increase in the total production workstations resulting from our revenue growth in we added  new production workstations in the fourth quarter due to new business wins 
these additional workstations were in process of being ramped for new client programs during the fourth quarter and resulted in a slight decrease in the total utilization percentage on a year over year basis 
database marketing and consulting on september   newgen and teletech entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our database marketing and consulting business 
as a result of the transaction which was completed on september   newgen received million in cash and recorded a loss on disposal of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this disposition 
the revenue from this business was generated utilizing a database and contact system to promote the sales and service business of automobile dealership customers using targeted marketing solutions through the phone  mail  email  and the web 
this business generated a loss from operations including additional impairment and restructuring charges of approximately million after corporate allocations for the year ended december  we entered into an agreement with the buyer of our database marketing and consulting business to provide ongoing bpo services to that segment that were previously being performed by us 
we reviewed the direct cash flows associated with this agreement and compared them to our estimates of the revenue associated with the database marketing and consulting business 
we concluded that these direct cash flows were significant 
as a result  the operations included in the database marketing and consulting 
table of contents business did not meet the criteria under sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and therefore was not classified as discontinued operations 
prior to the sale and as a result of the business continued losses  during june  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would dispose of our database marketing and consulting business 
this triggered impairment testing on an interim basis for this segment under the guidance of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the database  marketing and consulting business recorded an impairment loss of million during the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of their goodwill to zero 
overall as shown below in the results of operations  we have improved income from operations due to a variety of factors  including the following expansion of work on certain existing client programs  our multi phased cost reduction plan  transitioning work on certain client programs to lower cost delivery centers  increased capacity utilization  improving individual client program profitability and or eliminating certain underperforming client programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition for each client arrangement  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of our service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if all criteria are met  we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all of the criteria are met 
our bpo segments recognize revenue under three models production rate revenue is recognized based on the billable time or number of transactions of each associate  as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable time or transaction is based on a pre determined contractual rate 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality  performance and volume 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our clients based on the achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from clients prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue 
hybrid hybrid models include production rate and performance based elements 
for these types of arrangements  the company allocates revenue to the elements based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue for each element is recognized based on the methods described above 

table of contents certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we meet or exceed certain performance criteria as set forth in the contract 
increases or decreases to monthly billings arising from such contract terms are reflected in revenue as earned or incurred 
from time to time  we make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts recorded as contract acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
those expenditures are capitalized and amortized in proportion to the initial expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
amortization of these costs is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
as required by sfas  we continually review the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future tax periods under the more likely than not criteria 
in making this judgment  sfas requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  should be considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
in the future  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
further  we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
we estimate our annual effective tax rate each quarter based on a combination of actual and forecasted results of subsequent quarters 
consequently  significant changes in our actual quarterly or forecasted results may impact the effective tax rate for the current or future periods 
the financial accounting standards board recently issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas fin was effective for our year 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact fin has had on our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management s judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment include  among other things  the age of the identified receivable  client financial condition  previous client payment history and any recent communications with the client 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our individual delivery centers in accordance with sfas  which requires that a long lived asset group be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group may not be recoverable 
when the operating results of a delivery center have deteriorated to the point it is likely that losses will continue for the foreseeable future  or we expect that a delivery center will be closed or 
table of contents otherwise disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life  we select the delivery center for further review 
for delivery centers selected for further review  we estimate the probability weighted future cash flows resulting from operating the delivery center over its useful life 
significant judgment is involved in projecting future capacity utilization  pricing  labor costs and the estimated useful life of the delivery center 
we do not subject to the same test delivery centers that have been operated for less than two years or those delivery centers that have been impaired within the past two years the two year rule because we believe sufficient time is necessary to establish a market presence and build a client base for such new or modified delivery centers in order to adequately assess recoverability 
however  such delivery centers are nonetheless evaluated in case other factors would indicate an impairment had occurred 
for impaired delivery centers  we write the assets down to their estimated fair market value 
if the assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove insufficient  the fair market value estimate of the delivery centers may be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed fair market value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
we assess the realizable value of capitalized software development costs based upon current estimates of future cash flows from services utilizing the underlying software 
no impairment had occurred as of december  goodwill we assess the realizability of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it may be impaired 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales  or valuations of other similar businesses 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises during a prior period 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services and projected labor costs 
we then use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
based on the analyses performed in the fourth quarter of  there was no impairment to the december  goodwill balances of our reporting units 
if projected revenue used in the analysis of goodwill was less than forecast the projections assumed average revenue growth rates ranging from to per annum over a three year period  there would still be no impairment to goodwill 
alternatively  our database marketing and consulting business continued to incur operating losses through the second quarter of as we continued to consider strategic alternatives for this segment  we determined in june that it was more likely than not that we would dispose of our database marketing and consulting business  which was then completed in september these two items triggered impairment testing on an interim basis for this reporting unit under sfas the first step of the impairment testing indicated that the carrying value of the database marketing and consulting business exceeded its fair value 
we determined the fair value of the business by weighting discounted cash flow analyses based on the probability of the different outcomes 
the decrease in the fair value as compared to the calculation in the step one test performed in prior quarters was due to two factors 
the first factor was that the expectations regarding future results of the reporting unit used in the discounted cash flow analyses were below the expectations reflected in the analyses of the prior quarter 
while the revenue declines and operating losses for this segment had generally stabilized  returning this business to profitability was expected to take longer than previously forecasted 
the second factor was that the indications of fair market value received from interested third parties were less than the carrying 
table of contents value of the reporting unit 
given these indications of a possible impairment  we performed the second step of the impairment testing 
the second step of the impairment testing indicated that the book value of the business goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value was determined by reviewing the current assets and liabilities  property  plant and equipment  and other identifiable intangible assets both those recorded and not recorded to determine the appropriate fair value of the business assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase accounting analysis 
the fair value of these items based on the hypothetical analysis was then compared to the fair value used in the step one test the hypothetical purchase price to calculate the implied fair value of the business goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero 
as a result  an impairment charge of million for the entirety of the database marketing and consulting business goodwill was recorded during the second quarter of this was recorded in impairment losses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
restructuring liability we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our delivery centers and existing markets 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing delivery centers and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
we follow sfas  which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing delivery centers is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the facility 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a reversal of previously reported losses 
adoption of sfas no 
r and equity based compensation expense during the first quarter of  we adopted sfas r applying the modified prospective method 
sfas r requires all equity based payments to employees to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income based on the grant date fair value of the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for equity based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations  and equity based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure within the notes to the financial statements 
we did not modify the terms of any previously granted options in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r 
derivatives we use forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate volatility 
we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with the criteria established in sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas also requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment 
based on the criteria established by sfas  all of our cash flow hedge contracts are deemed effective 
our cash flow hedges are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  with changes in the fair value of qualifying hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the settlement of 
table of contents these derivatives will result in reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings and gains or losses will be recorded to revenue 
while we expect that our derivative instruments will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if the hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we do not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected currently in earnings 
contingencies we record a liability in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management  with the advice of legal counsel  reviews all litigation and claims on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss based upon the assessments of in house counsel and outside counsel  as appropriate 
explanation of key metrics and other items cost of services cost of services principally includes costs incurred in connection with our bpo operations and database marketing services  including direct labor  telecommunications  printing  postage  sales and use tax and certain fixed costs associated with delivery centers 
in addition  cost of services includes income related to grants we may receive from time to time from local or state governments as an incentive to locate delivery centers in their jurisdictions which reduce the cost of services for those facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with administrative services such as sales  marketing  product development  legal settlements  legal  information systems including core technology and telephony infrastructure and accounting and finance 
it also includes equity based compensation expense  outside professional fees ie legal and accounting services  building expense for non delivery center facilities and other items associated with general business administration 
restructuring charges  net restructuring charges  net primarily include costs incurred in conjunction with reductions in force or decisions to exit facilities  including termination benefits and lease liabilities  net of expected sublease rentals 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our grants  debt and capitalized lease obligations 
other income the main components of other income are miscellaneous receipts not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction gains and income from the sale of a software and intellectual property license agreement 
other expenses the main components of other expenses are expenditures not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction losses and corporate legal settlements 

table of contents presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also excludes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for our consolidated results amounts in thousands year ended december  as restated as restated free cash flow purchases of property  plant and equipment net cash provided by operating activities we discuss factors affecting free cash flow between periods in the liquidity and capital resources section below

further  income taxes are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions  in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
in future years  our effective tax rate is expected to return to approximately to  principally because we expect our distribution of pre tax income between the us and our international tax jurisdictions to return to more typical levels seen in recent years

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our million amended and restated credit agreement  dated september  the credit facility 
in  we generated positive operating cash flows of million which fully funded our capital expenditures of million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
should we need additional long term liquidity to fund organic growth  acquisitions or share repurchases we have the option to increase our credit facility to million subject to approval by the lenders at any time up to days prior to the maturity of the credit facility on september  we may also request a one year extension of the september  maturity date  subject to unanimous approval by the lenders 
however  we may make acquisitions or enter into joint ventures and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and cash and cash equivalents we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their original maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities we reinvest our cash flows from operating activities in our business or in the purchase of our outstanding stock 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase from to resulted 
table of contents primarily from increased net income 
the increase from to resulted primarily from increased net income as well as favorable changes in working capital accounts 
cash flows from investing activities we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted from not having the dac acquisition which was a one time event in and from a decrease in capital expenditures 
the increase from to resulted from the acquisition of dac and expanded capital expenditures for growth in our embedded client base as well as for new client contracts 
cash flows from financing activities for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by used in financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the change from to is due to a decrease in net borrowings on the line of credit and proceeds from stock option exercises  in addition to increased payments to minority shareholders  and purchases of our outstanding stock 
the change from to resulted from a decrease in the purchase of our outstanding stock and increased exercises of stock options 
free cash flow free cash flow see presentation of non gaap measurements for definition of free cash flow was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the increase from to resulted primarily from higher cash flows from operations and lower purchases of property  plant and equipment 
the increase from to resulted from higher cash flows from operations and the absence of the short term government program discussed above 
obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations  which includes both on and off balance sheet obligations  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands less than to to over year years years years total credit facility capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating lease commitments total contractual obligations to be paid in a foreign currency are translated at the period end exchange rate 
the contractual obligation table excludes our fin liabilities of million because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of cash payments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
purchase obligations occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients which currently represent approximately of our annual revenue to provide us with telecommunication services 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arm s length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements we expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately of the expected capital expenditures in are related to the opening and or expansion of delivery centers 
table of contents and relates to the maintenance capital required for existing assets and internal technology projects 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure 
we also expect to continue to incur outside legal  accounting and consulting expenses in conjunction with the class action lawsuit filed against us and certain current directors and officers and our review of historical equity based accounting practices 
although we cannot predict the amount of such expenses in  we have incurred million of expenses in and an additional million of expenses in the first quarter of we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of our operations 
the launch of large client contracts may result in short term negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants on september   we entered into our credit facility  which permits us to borrow up to million  with an option to increase the borrowing limit to a maximum of million subject to approval by the lenders at any time up to days prior to maturity of the credit facility on september  on october   we exercised our option to increase the borrowing limit of the credit facility to million 
we may request a one year extension of the september  maturity date  subject to unanimous approval by the lenders 
the credit facility is secured by the majority of our domestic accounts receivable and a pledge of of the capital stock of specified material foreign subsidiaries 
our domestic subsidiaries are guarantors under the credit facility 
since november  we have entered into three amendments to our credit facility with our lenders 
these amendments extended the time for us to deliver our financial statements for the quarter ended september   for the year ended december  and for the quarter ended march   until august  in the amendments  our lenders also consented to i the delayed filing of periodic reports with the sec by august   ii the restatement of previously filed financial statements  and iii the nasdaq staff determination notices with respect to the possible delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market due to the delayed periodic reports 
as a result of these amendments and the filing of the delayed periodic reports  there is presently no basis for our lenders to declare an event of default under our credit facility and we may continue to borrow funds thereunder 
the credit facility  which includes customary financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  purchases of treasury stock and acquisition financing 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
the credit facility accrues interest at a rate based on either the prime rate  defined as the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or the libor plus an applicable credit spread  at our option 
the interest rate will vary based on our leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
as of december   interest accrued at the weighted average rate of approximately 
in addition  we are obligated to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit facility  at a rate of per annum 
as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of million and million  respectively 
our borrowing capacity is reduced by million as a result of the letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
the unused commitment under the credit facility was million as of december  
table of contents client concentration our five largest clients accounted for  and of our annual revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of our consolidated earnings 
the profitability of services provided to these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client 
in addition  clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
we believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party  this risk is mitigated  in part  by the service level disruptions that would arise for our clients 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and additionally  a particular client can have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates  the london interbank offered rate libor and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   we had entered into financial hedge instruments with several financial institutions to manage and reduce the impact of changes  principally the us canadian dollar and us philippine peso exchange rates 
interest rate risk the interest rate on our credit facility is variable based upon the prime rate and libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was a million outstanding balance under the credit facility 
if the prime rate or libor increased by basis points  there would not be a material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we have operations in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  costa rica  england  germany  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  northern ireland  the philippines  scotland  singapore  south africa and spain 
expenses from these operations  and in some cases revenue  are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
as a result  we may experience substantial foreign currency translation gains or losses due to the volatility of other currencies compared to the us dollar  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations 
for the years ended december  and  revenue from non us countries represented and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
a global business strategy for us is to serve certain clients from delivery centers located in other foreign countries  including argentina  brazil  canada  costa rica  malaysia  mexico  the philippines  and south africa  in order to leverage lower operating costs in these foreign countries 
in order to mitigate the risk of these foreign currencies from strengthening against the functional currency of the contracting subsidiary  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though typically not  of the foreign currency exposure related to client programs served 
table of contents from these foreign countries 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall strengthening of the foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the contracting subsidiary over the long term 
the majority of this exposure is related to work performed from delivery centers located in canada  the philippines  argentina  and mexico 
during the years ended december   and  the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar by  and  respectively 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our canadian subsidiary to acquire a total of million canadian dollars through december at a fixed price in us dollars not to exceed million 
however  certain contracts  representing million in canadian dollars  give us the right but not the obligation to purchase the canadian dollars 
if the canadian dollar depreciates relative to the contracted exchange rate  we will elect to purchase the canadian dollars at the then beneficial market exchange rate 
during the years ended december   and  the philippine peso strengthened against the us dollar by  and  respectively 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our philippine subsidiary to acquire a total of billion philippine pesos through december at a fixed price of million us dollars 
during the years ended december   and  the argentine peso weakened against the us dollar by  and  respectively 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our argentinean subsidiary to acquire a total of million argentine pesos through september at a fixed price of million us dollars 
during the years ended december   and  the mexican peso weakened against the us dollar by and and strengthened against the us dollar by  respectively 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our mexican subsidiary to acquire a total of million mexican pesos through december at a fixed price of million us dollars 
as of december   we had total derivative assets associated with foreign exchange contracts of million 
we use the discounted period end forward rates methodology to determine market value of our forward and option contracts 
the following table summarizes the amount by currency and the portion of the asset that settles within the next twelve months amounts in thousands 
percentage us dollar settled within dates contracts derivative assets amount one year are through canadian dollar  december philippine peso  december argentine peso september mexican peso december the canadian dollar derivative asset amount excludes approximately million in unamortized option premiums 
if the us canadian dollar  us dollar philippine peso  us dollar argentine peso  or us dollar mexican peso exchange rate were to increase or decrease by from current period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses in our underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency while some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
for example  the inter company transactions that are expected to be settled are denominated in the local currency of the billing subsidiary 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local 
table of contents currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income  which is recorded in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
at december  we had a cash flow hedge of us dollar million related to a short term intercompany payable that one of our foreign subsidiaries owes to our us parent pertaining to certain tax liabilities 
we elected not to designate this as a hedge under fas and accordingly the change in the fair value of the hedge instrument is recorded as a component of other  net and offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying short term intercompany payable 
foreign exchange counterparty exposure the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations denominated in foreign currencies 
the company diversifies its foreign exchange contract exposures among many us investment grade financial institutions 
we do not perceive any material risk that the counterparties creditworthiness will impact their ability to deliver in accordance with the terms of the contract 
fair value of debt and equity securities we did not have any investments in debt or equity securities as of december
