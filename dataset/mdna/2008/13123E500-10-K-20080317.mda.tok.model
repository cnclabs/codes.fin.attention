item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results we are a leading provider of sales performance management spm software solutions designed to align internal sales resources and distribution channels with corporate strategy 
our software enhances core processes in sales management  such as the structuring of sales territories  the management of sales force talent  the establishment of sales targets and the creation and execution of sales incentive plans 
using our spm software solutions  companies can tailor these core processes to further their strategic objectives  including coordinating sales efforts with long range strategies regarding sales and margin targets  growth initiatives  sales force talent development  
table of contents territory expansion and market penetration 
our customers can also use our spm solutions to address more tactical objectives  such as successful new product launches and effective cross selling strategies 
our spm solutions can be purchased and delivered as either an on premise software solution or an on demand service 
however  we have recently announced that we intend for our on demand service to be our lead offering 
our hosted on demand service allows customers to use our software products through a web interface rather than purchase computer equipment and install our software at their locations 
leading companies worldwide in the financial services  insurance  communications  high technology  life sciences and retail industries rely on our solutions for their sales performance management and incentive compensation needs 
we sell our products pursuant to perpetual software licenses or as an on demand service both directly through our sales force and in conjunction with our strategic partners 
we also offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
we generate recurring subscription and support revenues from our on demand service and from support and maintenance agreements associated with our product licenses  both of which are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
both subscription and support services provide for recurring revenue streams  but remain subject to periodic adjustment or cancellation 
revenue growth our total revenues increased in by to million compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of a growth in services and other revenues and a growth in subscription and support revenues in compared to we attribute the revenue growth to a number of factors  including increased spending on our sales and marketing efforts and increased configuration and integration engagements with customers who had previously purchased our software 
services and other revenues and subscription and support revenues were also positively affected by the larger number of on demand transactions in compared to our license revenues increased by to million for as compared to the results of our license revenues and increase in recurring subscription and support revenues reflected the shift in our business emphasis and strategy from our perpetual offering to our software as a service saas on demand offering 
shift in business strategy to on demand in an effort to capitalize on the market opportunity created by the growing demand for software as a service saas  we have shifted our business focus and strategy to focus on our on demand offering 
this shift has also been reflected in our license revenues compared to the growth in subscription and support revenues as discussed above 
revenues from our on demand offering are more predictable and allow us to better align our cost structure 
however  we only introduced our on demand offering in  and continue to evaluate optimal pricing and other terms of the offering 
to date  we have not been able to provide our on demand offering on a profitable basis 
while we expect the results of our on demand offering to improve as we achieve operational scale  if we are unable to offer our on demand service on a profitable basis  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
other business highlights operating expenses increased by for compared to  but we took cost saving actions in the fourth quarter of we completed an reduction in force and recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with severance and termination related costs  most of which were severance related cash expenditures 
we realized some early cost savings during the fourth quarter of from the reduction in force  and we expect to realize additional savings in related to this action 
the cost savings program was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the first quarter of as of december   accrued restructuring charges were million on november   our board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
we have adopted a rule b repurchase plan that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock under the repurchase program at times when we would not ordinarily be in the market because of our trading policies 
on january   we completed the acquisition of compensation technologies  a leading provider of services for planning  implementing  and supporting incentive compensation processes and tools 
under the terms 
table of contents of the agreement  we paid compensation technologies million up front and will pay up to an additional million upon the completion of key milestones and achievement of target financial metrics 
the combination of compensation technologies compensation management services cms and callidus on demand offerings provides our customers with a fully managed sales incentive compensation program that includes plan analysis  modeling and design support  plan deployment  reporting  analytics  and ongoing administration 
the acquisition augments our portfolio of services offerings while at the same time boosting our on demand business 
challenges and risks in response to market demand  we recently shifted our primary business focus from the sale of perpetual licenses for our products to the provision of our software as a service 
the software as a service model provides more predictable quarterly revenues 
however  we have yet to achieve a scale of operations that enables us to provide our software as a service on a consistently profitable basis 
if we are unable to provide our software as a service on a profitable basis in the future  our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
from a business perspective  we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  however  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our on demand and license transactions and the timing of revenue recognition resulting from greater flexibility in contract terms 
we believe one of our major remaining challenges is increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products and services over competing it projects 
to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our on demand services  and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our truecomp suite of products 
if we are unable to grow our revenues  we may be unable to achieve and sustain profitability 
in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  our use of estimates and the related disclosures with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we generate revenues by licensing software  providing related software support and providing our software application as a service through our on demand subscription offering  and providing related professional services to our customers 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 

table of contents we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we will not recognize revenue until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
in perpetual licensing arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier  or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
in on demand arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred as the service is provided to the customer 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
in arrangements where the customer is obligated to pay at least of the license amount within normal payment terms and the remaining is to be paid within a year from the contract effective date  we will recognize the license revenue for the entire arrangement upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
this policy is effective as long as we continue to maintain a history of providing similar terms to customers and collecting from those customers without providing any contractual concessions 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until cash collection 
perpetual licensing 
our perpetual software license arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products  generally based on a specified number of payees  and ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates  generally over renewable twelve month periods 
if we are selected to provide integration and configuration services  then the software arrangement will also include professional services  generally priced on a time and materials basis 
depending upon the elements in the arrangement and the terms of the related agreement  we recognize license revenues under either the residual or the contract accounting method 
certain arrangements result in the payment of customer referral fees to third parties that resell our software products 
in these arrangements  license revenues are recorded  net of such referral fees  at the time the software license has been delivered to a third party reseller and an end user customer has been identified 
residual method 
perpetual license fees are recognized upon delivery whether licenses are sold separately from or together with integration and configuration services  provided that i the criteria described above have been met  ii payment of the license fees is not dependent upon performance of the integration and configuration services  and iii the services are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize these license revenues using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenues are recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each undelivered element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for a certain class of transactions  the fair value of the maintenance portion of our arrangements is based on stated renewal rates rather than stand alone sales 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these 
table of contents services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the items for which evidence of fair value cannot be established are delivered 
if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then the entire amount of revenue is recognized over the maintenance delivery period 
on demand revenue 
in hosted arrangements where we provide our software application as a service  we considered emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and concluded that these transactions are considered service arrangements and fall outside of the scope of sop accordingly  we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
customers will typically prepay for our hosted services  amounts which we will defer and recognize ratably over the non cancelable term of the customer contract 
in addition to the hosting services  these arrangements may also include implementation and configuration services  which are billed on a time and materials basis and recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
we evaluate whether each of the elements in these arrangements represents a separate unit of accounting  as defined by eitf  using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i we sell or could readily sell the element unaccompanied by the other elements  ii the element has stand alone value to the customer  iii there is objective reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and iv there is a general right of return 
for those arrangements where the elements qualify for separate units of accounting  the hosting revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the service commencement date 
implementation and configuration services  when sold with the hosted offering  are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and are recognized utilizing the proportional performance method of accounting for fixed price contracts 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total contractual arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the fair value of the undelivered and delivered items when sold separately 
if consulting services for implementation and configuration associated with a hosted on demand arrangement does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  we will recognize the revenue from implementation and configuration services ratably over the remaining non cancelable term of the subscription contract once the implementation is complete 
in addition  we will defer the direct costs of the implementation and configuration services and amortize those costs over the same time period as the related revenue is recognized 
if the direct costs incurred for a contract exceed the non cancelable contract value  then we will recognize a loss for incurred and projected direct costs in excess of the contract value 
the deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet for these consulting arrangements totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of the deferred costs are included in prepaid and other current assets  with the remaining amount included in deposits and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
included in the deferred costs for hosting arrangements is the deferral of commission payments to our direct sales force  which we amortize over the non cancelable term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized 
the commission payments are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferral of commission expenditures related to our hosted on demand product offerings was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
maintenance revenue 
under perpetual software license arrangements  a customer typically pre pays maintenance for the first twelve months  and the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional service revenue 
professional service revenues primarily consist of integration services related to the installation and configuration of our products as well as training 
our installation and configuration services do not involve customization to  or development of  the underlying software code 
substantially all of our 
table of contents professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis 
reimbursements  including those related to travel and out of pocket expenses  are included in services and other revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of services and other revenues 
for professional service arrangements with a fixed fee  we recognize revenue utilizing the proportional performance method of accounting 
we estimate the proportional performance on fixed fee contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  revenue is recognized upon completion of performance 
to the extent we enter into a fixed fee services contract  a loss will be recognized any time the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenues 
contract accounting method 
for arrangements where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  such as where the payment of the license fees is dependent upon performance of the services  both the license and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we generally use the percentage of completion method because we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to contract costs and the extent of progress toward completion 
however  if we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates  we use the completed contract method 
if total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated loss on the arrangement at the time such determination is made 
in certain arrangements  we have provided for unique acceptance criteria associated with the delivery of consulting services 
in these instances  we have recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of sop to the extent there is contingent revenue in these arrangements  we measure the level of profit that is expected based on the non contingent revenue and the total expected project costs 
if we are assured of a certain level of profit excluding the contingent revenue  we recognize the non contingent revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is netted against accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  totaled approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
we generally warrant that our services will be performed in accordance with the criteria agreed upon in a statement of work  which we generally execute with each applicable customer prior to commencing work 
should these services not be performed in accordance with the agreed upon criteria  we typically provide remediation services until such time as the criteria are met 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgments and make estimates of sales return reserves related to potential future requirements to provide remediation services in connection with current period service revenues 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues if  for any period  actual returns differ from management s judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balance  which is netted against our accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  was approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we began recording stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with fasb statement no 
r revised  
table of contents share based payment sfas r  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
refer to note stock based compensation in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion of our adoption of sfas r 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
with the exception of the net deferred tax assets of one of our foreign subsidiaries  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
we also use estimates in determining income tax positions under financial interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment and is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
investments we consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity on the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents as of december  and consisted of money market funds and corporate notes and obligations 
we determine the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of december  and  all investment securities are designated as available for sale 
we consider all investments that are available for sale that have a maturity date longer than three months to be short term investments  including those investments with a maturity date of longer than one year that are highly liquid and for which we do not have a positive intent to hold to maturity 
these available for sale securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information  with the unrealized gains losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we periodically review the realizable value of our investments in marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider such factors as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the market outlook in general and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
if an other than temporary impairment of the investments is deemed to exist  the carrying value of the investment would be written down to its estimated fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  as the fasb had previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
table of contents november  however  in february  the fasb issued fsp fas  which delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except items recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
we adopted the new accounting provision  except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas  as of january  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was for and  for  which resulted from the change in accounting principle from apb no

the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted from the requirement of sfas r to reduce the amount of stock based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate or  in other words  the estimated number of shares that are not expected to vest as a result of an employee terminating prior to becoming fully vested in an award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we did not reduce stock based compensation expense based on an estimated forfeiture rate 
table of contents but rather recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation as actual forfeitures occurred 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is generally one time in nature and not expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis

auction rate securities as of december   we had auction rate securities with a par value of million 
in january  we liquidated million in par value of these auction rate securities 
the remaining auction rate securities with a par value of million had successfully repriced in january and early february however  beginning in late february  these remaining auction rate securities failed to reprice  resulting in us continuing to hold these securities 
each of these securities had been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates 
all of these securities are rated aaa 
in addition  all of them are education municipal securities substantially collateralized by the us department of education federal family education loan program guarantee 
liquidity for these securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every days 
because of the short interest rate reset period  we have historically recorded them as current available for sale securities 
as a result of the failed auctions  the reset interest rates were increased to above market and the next auctions are scheduled beginning in march we will not be able to liquidate any of our remaining auction rate securities until a future auction is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the notes are redeemed 
as of march   we had auction rate securities with a par value of million 
these investments are on deposit with major financial institutions 
we will continue to evaluate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities for a potential other than temporary impairment if a decline in fair value occurs  in accordance with sfas no

contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations in thousands at december  contractual cash obligations that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the following table 
in addition  we have unconditional purchase commitments for goods and services where payments are based  in part  on volume or type of services we require 
in those cases  we only included the minimum volume or purchase commitment in the table below 
payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond operating lease commitments unconditional purchase commitments with the exception of the above contractual cash obligations  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
for our new york  new york and san jose  california offices  we have two certificates of deposit totaling approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively  pledged as collateral to secure letters of credit required by our landlords for security deposits 

table of contents we believe our existing cash and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated short term and long term cash requirements as well as the contractual obligations listed above 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenues we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  market acceptance of our on demand service offering  our ability to offer on demand service on a consistently profitable basis and the continuing market acceptance of our other products

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is also a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we invest in investment grade securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our investment portfolios  which is approved by our board of directors 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
at this time  we believe that  due to the nature of our investments  the financial condition of the issuers  and our ability and intent to hold the investments through short term loss fluctuations  factors would not indicate that any unrealized gains and losses should be viewed as other than temporary 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  high quality corporate debt obligations and united states government obligations 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information  with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  which typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately three months  and all investment securities had maturities of less than months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity total total year more than principal fair or less year amount value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money 
therefore  we currently have no exposure to market risk related to debt instruments 
to the extent we enter into or issue debt instruments in the future  we will have interest expense market risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our united kingdom  germany  canada and australia operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues was denominated in foreign currency 
our 
table of contents exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we expect to continue to transact a majority of our business in united states dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
unrealized gains and losses related to our forward exchange contracts were not material for the year ended december  we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the immediate future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our foreign exchange rate contract investment strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow
