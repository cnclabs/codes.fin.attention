item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a relates to amerigas partners and the operating partnership 
our md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
executive overview amerigas partners is the largest retail propane marketer in the united states  with sales to retail customers of nearly a billion gallons during the year ended september  fiscal 
we deliver propane to approximately million customers from our distribution locations in states 
the propane industry is mature  with only modest growth in residential customer demand 
our strategy is to grow through acquisitions and internal sales programs  leverage our national and local economies of scale and achieve operating efficiencies through productivity programs 
during the past three years our financial results reflect growth achieved through execution of the strategy referred to above 
temperatures based upon heating degree days in fiscal were colder than in the year ended september  fiscal although slightly warmer than normal 
notwithstanding the slightly colder year over year weather and the full year effects of fiscal acquisitions  retail volumes declined modestly in fiscal reflecting the effects of record high propane commodity prices on customer usage and a weak economy 
in fiscal  net income was million compared with net income of million in fiscal which included the effects of a million pre tax gain from the sale of our million barrel liquefied petroleum gas storage facility located in arizona 
notwithstanding the lower retail volumes sold in fiscal  total margin increased due principally to high average propane margin per retail gallon sold 
colder temperatures during fiscal compared with the year ended september  fiscal had a favorable impact on retail volumes sold and total margin 
net income during fiscal includes the impact of a million loss on early extinguishment of debt resulting from the refinancings of certain amerigas partners and amerigas olp debt 
in fiscal and beyond  we will continue to focus on growing through acquisitions and internal sales programs  leveraging our national and local economies of scale and achieving operating efficiencies through productivity programs 
we expect to achieve base business growth by providing best in class customer service and improving the effectiveness of our sales force  while maintaining competitive prices 

table of contents analysis of results of operations the following analysis compares the partnership s results of operations for fiscal with fiscal and fiscal with fiscal the following table provides gallons sold  weather and certain financial information for the partnership and should be read in conjunction with the sections fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal below 
year ended september  millions of dollars  except where noted gallons sold millions retail wholesale revenues retail propane wholesale propane other total margin a ebitda b operating income net income degree days warmer than normal c a total margin represents total revenues less cost of sales propane and cost of sales other 
b earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance and is not a measure of performance or financial condition under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management believes ebitda is a meaningful non gaap financial measure used by investors to compare the partnership s operating performance with other companies within the propane industry and assess its ability to meet loan covenants 
the partnership s definition of ebitda may be different from that used by other companies 
management uses ebitda to compare year over year profitability of the business without regard to capital structure as well as to compare the relative performance of the partnership to that of other master limited partnerships without regard to their financing methods  capital structure  income taxes or historical cost basis 
in view of the omission of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization from ebitda  management also assesses the profitability of the business by comparing net income for the relevant years 
management also uses ebitda to assess the partnership s profitability because its parent  ugi corporation  uses the partnership s ebitda to assess the profitability of the partnership 
ugi corporation discloses the partnership s ebitda as the profitability measure to comply with the requirement in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  to provide profitability information about its domestic propane segment 
the following table includes reconciliations of net income to ebitda for the periods presented year ended september  net income income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization ebitda c deviation from average heating degree days for the year period based upon national weather statistics provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa for airports in the united states  excluding alaska 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal based upon heating degree day data  average temperatures in our service territories were warmer than normal in fiscal compared with temperatures that were warmer than normal in fiscal notwithstanding the slightly colder fiscal weather and the full year benefits of acquisitions made in fiscal  retail gallons sold were slightly lower reflecting  among other things  customer conservation in response to increasing propane product costs and a weak economy 
the average wholesale propane cost at mont belvieu  texas  one of the major liquefied petroleum gas lpg supply points in the us increased nearly during fiscal over the average cost during fiscal retail propane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting a million increase due to the higher average selling prices partially offset by a million decrease as a result of the lower retail volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting a million increase from higher average wholesale selling prices partially offset by a million decrease from lower wholesale volumes sold 
total cost of sales increased million to  million in fiscal reflecting higher propane product costs 
total margin was million greater in fiscal principally reflecting higher average propane margin per retail gallon sold and  to a much lesser extent  higher fee income 
ebitda in fiscal was million compared to ebitda of million in fiscal fiscal ebitda includes million resulting from the sale of the partnership s arizona storage facility 
excluding the effects of this gain in fiscal  ebitda in fiscal increased million over fiscal principally reflecting the previously mentioned increase in total margin partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses 
the increased operating expenses reflect expenses associated with acquisitions  increased vehicle fuel and maintenance expenses  greater general insurance expense and  to a lesser extent  higher uncollectible accounts expenses largely attributable to the higher revenues 
the partnership s operating income decreased million in fiscal reflecting the lower ebitda and higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the full year effects of fiscal propane business acquisitions and plant and equipment expenditures 
fiscal compared with fiscal temperatures in the partnership s service territories based upon heating degree days during fiscal were warmer than normal compared with temperatures that were warmer than normal during fiscal retail propane volumes sold increased approximately reflecting greater demand attributable to the colder weather and the effects of higher sales in our amerigas cylinder exchange program 
retail propane revenues increased million in fiscal reflecting an million increase due to higher average selling prices and million due to the higher volumes sold 
wholesale propane revenues decreased slightly reflecting a million decrease due to lower volumes sold largely offset by a million increase due to higher average selling prices 
in fiscal  our average retail propane product cost per retail gallon sold was approximately higher than in fiscal resulting in higher year over year prices to our customers 
total cost of sales increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal primarily reflecting the increase in propane product costs and the increased volumes sold 
total margin increased million principally due to the higher average retail propane margins per gallon  the higher volumes and higher fees in response to increases in operating and administrative expenses 

table of contents ebitda during fiscal increased million as a result of the previously mentioned increase in total margin  a million gain from the sale of the partnership s storage facility in arizona  and the absence of a million loss on early extinguishments of debt recorded in fiscal partially offset by a million increase in operating and administrative expenses 
the million loss on early extinguishments of debt in fiscal was associated with refinancings of amerigas olp s series a and series c first mortgage notes totaling million  and million of amerigas partners senior notes  with million of amerigas partners senior notes due the partnership also used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay amerigas olp s million term loan 
the increase in fiscal operating and administrative expenses principally resulted from higher employee compensation and benefits  vehicle costs and maintenance and repairs expenses 
both fiscal and benefited from favorable expense reductions related to general insurance primarily reflecting improved claims experience 
operating income increased million in fiscal mainly reflecting the previously mentioned increase in ebitda but excluding the impact of the prior period s million loss on extinguishments of debt which is included in ebitda but not operating income slightly offset by greater depreciation expense 
net income in fiscal increased million reflecting the increase in operating income  the absence of the fiscal loss on extinguishments of debt and a decrease in interest expense 
financial condition and liquidity capitalization and liquidity the partnership s debt outstanding at september  totaled million including current maturities of long term debt of million 
total debt outstanding at september  includes long term debt comprising million of amerigas partners senior notes  million of amerigas olp first mortgage notes and million of other long term debt 
amerigas olp expects to refinance million of long term debt maturing in march with proceeds from the issuance of a term loan 
amerigas olp s credit agreement expires on october  and consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million acquisition facility 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general purposes of amerigas olp 
the acquisition facility provides amerigas olp with the ability to borrow up to million to finance the purchase of propane businesses or propane business assets or  to the extent it is not so used  for working capital and general purposes  subject to restrictions in the amerigas olp first mortgage notes 
issued and outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility  which reduce the amount available for borrowings  totaled million at september  and million at september  amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at september  or at september   the partnership s available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement was million 
although commodity propane prices increased through much of fiscal  a precipitous decline in prices in late fiscal which continued into fiscal has resulted in greater cash needed by the partnership to fund counterparty collateral requirements 
these collateral requirements are associated with derivative financial instruments used by the partnership to manage market price risk associated with fixed sales price commitments to customers principally during the heating season months of october through march 
at september   the partnership had made collateral deposits of million associated with these derivative financial instruments 
at november   such collateral deposits totaled million 
in order to reduce cash collateral payment obligations and to provide the partnership with greater borrowing flexibility and a more cost effective use of its credit agreement  in october  ugi agreed to provide guarantees of up to million to amerigas olp s propane suppliers through september  in addition  on november   amerigas olp entered into a revolving credit agreement with two major banks supplemental credit agreement 
the supplemental credit agreement expires on may   and permits amerigas olp to borrow up to million for working capital and general purposes 
except for more restrictive covenants regarding the incurrence of additional indebtedness by amerigas olp  the supplemental credit agreement has restrictive covenants substantially similar to the existing amerigas olp credit agreement 
at november   the partnership had million of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements and million of unused ugi guarantees 

table of contents at september   the amount of net assets of the partnership s subsidiaries that was restricted from transfer as a result of the amount of available cash  computed in accordance with the partnership agreement  the applicable debt agreements and the partnership agreements of the partnership s subsidiaries  totaled approximately million 
in order to borrow under the credit agreement and the supplemental credit agreement  amerigas olp must satisfy certain financial covenants including  but not limited to  a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum debt to ebitda ratio and a minimum ebitda  as defined 
amerigas olp s financial covenants calculated as of september  permitted it to borrow up to the maximum amount available under its credit agreement 
based upon existing cash balances  the availability of the ugi guarantees  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowings available under its credit agreement and the supplemental credit agreement  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs in fiscal in addition  the partnership s management believes its liquidity will begin to improve in december for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership  as amended the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
the general partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business and for distributions during the next four quarters 
in addition  certain of the partnership s debt agreements require reserves be established for the payment of debt principal and interest 
distributions of available cash are made to limited partners and to the general partner giving effect to the interest of the general partner in distributions of available cash from amerigas olp to amerigas partners until available cash exceeds the minimum quarterly distribution of and the first target distribution of per common unit or a total of per common unit 
if available cash exceeds per common unit in any quarter  the general partner will receive a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution but only with respect to the amount by which the distribution per common unit to limited partners exceeds 

table of contents quarterly distributions of available cash per limited partner unit paid during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were as follows fiscal st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter because the partnership made distributions to common unitholders in excess of per limited partner unit beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the general partner has received a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution than its aggregate general partner interest in amerigas partners and amerigas olp 
the total amount of distributions received by the general partner with respect to its general partner interest in amerigas partners during fiscal and fiscal totaled million and million which amounts included incentive distributions of million and million  respectively 
on july   the general partner s board of directors approved a distribution of per common unit payable on august  to unitholders of record on august  this distribution included the regular quarterly distribution of per common unit and per common unit reflecting a distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s sale of its arizona storage facility in july contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including obligations associated with long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations  derivative instruments and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and millions of dollars total thereafter long term debt a interest on long term fixed rate debt b operating leases derivative financial instruments c propane supply contracts total a based upon stated maturity dates 
b based upon stated interest rates 
c represents the sum of amounts due from us if derivative financial instrument liabilities were settled at the september  amounts reflected in the financial statements 
the components of the other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet at september  principally consist of property and casualty liabilities and  to a much lesser extent  liabilities associated with executive compensation plans and employee post employment benefit programs 
these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual cash obligations and commitments because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount 
the table above excludes the penn fuel propane  llc purchase obligation of million see subsequent events acquisition of penn fuel propane  llc and partnership sale of propane storage facility below 

table of contents effect of recent market conditions the recent unprecedented volatility in credit and capital markets may create additional risks to the partnership in the future 
we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from  among other things  changes in interest rates and conditions in the credit and capital markets 
recent developments in the credit markets increase our possible exposure to the liquidity and credit risks of our suppliers  counterparties associated with derivative financial instruments and our customers 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity in the form of revolving credit facilities  letters of credit and guarantee arrangements to fund our operations including the collateral requirements of our derivative financial instruments 
additionally  we do not have significant amounts of long term debt maturing or revolving credit agreements terminating in the next several fiscal years 
accordingly  we do not believe that recent conditions in the credit and capital markets will have a significant impact on our liquidity 
although we believe that recent financial market conditions will not have a significant impact on our ability to fund our existing operations  such market conditions could restrict our ability to make a significant acquisition or limit the scope of major capital projects  if access to credit and capital markets is limited  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to credit risk relating to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at contract prices 
we monitor our counterparty credit risk exposure in order to minimize credit risk with any one supplier or financial instrument counterparty 
we have a diverse customer base that spans broad geographic  economic and demographic constituencies 
no single customer represents more than ten percent of our revenues or operating income 
notwithstanding our diverse customer profile  current conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of some of our customers to pay timely or result in increased customer bankruptcies which may lead to increased bad debts 
as previously mentioned  in order to manage market risk associated with the partnership s fixed price programs which permit customers to lock in the prices they pay for propane  the partnership has entered into derivative financial instruments that have collateral provisions 
these derivative instruments are used to manage market price risk principally during the heating season months of october through march 
if market prices for propane were to continue to fall during the fiscal heating season  we could be required to make significant additional cash collateral payments or to provide guarantees 
the partnership s management believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet such obligations and its projected cash needs in fiscal in addition  the partnership s management believes its liquidity will begin to improve in december cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership may use its credit agreement and supplemental credit agreement to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the year over year increase in cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital in the three year period ended september  principally reflects the improved year over year operating results 
cash required to fund changes in operating working capital totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the greater cash required to fund operating working capital in fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflects the impact of the timing of purchases and increases in propane prices on cash receipts from customers and net collateral deposit payments of million in fiscal associated with unsettled commodity derivative instruments 
as previously mentioned  falling commodity propane prices late in fiscal resulted in greater cash needed to fund counterparty collateral requirements under product cost management contracts 
the increase in cash flow required to fund working capital in fiscal compared with fiscal principally reflects the impact of propane prices on purchases of inventories and the timing of customers use of their deposits and prepayments 

table of contents investing activities 
investing activity cash flow is principally affected by investments in property  plant and equipment  cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and proceeds from sales of assets 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  and million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal the lower growth capital expenditures in fiscal reflect in large part lower capital expenditures associated with the partnership s grill cylinder exchange business 
in july  the partnership sold its million barrel liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal located near phoenix  arizona for net cash proceeds of million 
also during fiscal  the partnership acquired several retail propane distribution businesses  including the retail distribution businesses of all star gas corporation and shell gas lpg usa  and several cylinder refurbishing businesses for total net cash consideration of million 
financing activities 
changes in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to issuances and repayments of long term debt  net credit agreement borrowings  distributions on amerigas partners common units and issuances of amerigas partners common units 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal distributions in fiscal include the effects of an additional per common unit distribution paid in august to distribute a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s july sale of its arizona storage facility 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal reflect cash transactions associated with refinancings of certain amerigas partners and amerigas olp debt 
capital expenditures in the following table  we present capital expenditures which exclude acquisitions for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we also provide amounts we expect to spend in fiscal we expect to finance fiscal capital expenditures principally from cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreements 
year ended september  millions of dollars estimate property  plant and equipment expenditures the increase in fiscal estimated capital expenditures includes expenditures associated with a partnership system software replacement 
amerigas olp environmental matter by letter dated march   the new york state department of environmental conservation dec notified amerigas olp that dec had placed property owned by the partnership in saranac lake  new york on its registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites 
a site characterization study performed by dec disclosed contamination related to former manufactured gas plant operations on the site 
dec has classified the site as a significant threat to public health or environment with further action required 
the partnership is researching the history of the site and is investigating dec s findings 
the general partner has reviewed the preliminary site characterization study prepared by dec and is in the early stages of investigating the extent of contamination and the possible existence of other potentially responsible parties 
due to the early stage of such investigation  the amount of expected clean up costs cannot be reasonably estimated 
when such expected clean up costs can be reasonably estimated  it is possible that the amount could be material to the partnership s results of operations 

table of contents related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement and a management services agreement among amerigas eagle holdings  inc  the general partner of eagle olp  and the general partner  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi corporation ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
such corporate expenses totaled million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
these costs totaled million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
amerigas olp purchases propane from ugi energy services  inc and subsidiaries energy services  which is owned by an affiliate of ugi 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from energy services totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
amounts due to energy services at september  and totaled million and million  respectively  which are included in accounts payable related parties in our consolidated balance sheets 
in september  in conjunction with a propane business acquisition  the partnership issued  common units to the general partner in consideration for the retention of certain income tax liabilities having a fair value of per common unit 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for more information related to this transaction 
the partnership sold propane to certain affiliates of ugi 
such amounts were not material during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and the partnership generally passes on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
these derivative financial instruments contain collateral provisions 
as previously mentioned  precipitous declines in propane commodity prices late in fiscal which continued into fiscal has resulted in greater collateral requirements by our derivative instruments counterparties 
in order to minimize our credit risk associated with derivative commodity contracts  we monitor established credit limits with our contract counterparties 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact its fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact its cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under amerigas olp s credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
based upon the average level of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement in fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we enter into interest rate protection agreements 
the following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instruments held at september  and it also includes the changes in fair value that would result if there were a ten percent adverse change in the market price of propane and the three month libor fair value asset change in millions of dollars liability fair value september  propane swap and option contracts interest rate protection agreements september  propane swap and option contracts interest rate protection agreements because the partnership s derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane price or interest rate risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated anticipated transactions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals and environmental liabilities 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present 
in accordance with gaap  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled million 
depreciation expense of million was recorded during fiscal purchase price allocation 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment and most commonly impacts property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation 
subsequent events acquisition of penn fuel propane  llc and partnership sale of propane storage facility on october   amerigas olp acquired all of the assets of penn fuel propane  llc now named ugi central penn propane  llc  cpp from cpp  a subsidiary of ugi central penn gas  inc  for million cash plus estimated working capital of million 
cpp sells propane to customers primarily in eastern pennsylvania 
amerigas olp funded the acquisition of the assets of cpp principally from borrowings under its credit agreement 
on november   amerigas olp sold its  barrel refrigerated  above ground storage facility located on leased property in california for approximately million in cash 
we expect to record a pre tax gain of approximately million associated with this transaction during our first quarter of fiscal
