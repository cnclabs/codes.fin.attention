item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
dpi merger on september   discovery partners international  inc  or dpi  completed a merger with infinity pharmaceuticals  inc  or ipi  pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of dpi merged with and into ipi 
ipi was the surviving corporation in the merger  changed its name to infinity discovery  inc  or old infinity  and became a wholly owned subsidiary of dpi 
in addition  we changed our name from discovery partners international  inc to infinity pharmaceuticals  inc 
and our ticker symbol on the nasdaq global market to infi 
upon completion of the merger  our common stock was issued to old infinity stockholders  and we assumed all of the stock options  stock warrants and restricted stock of old infinity outstanding as of september  immediately following the closing of the merger  former old infinity stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and former dpi stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis 
in addition  after completion of the merger  the business conducted by the combined company became the one operated by old infinity prior to completion of the merger 
since former old infinity security holders owned  immediately following the merger  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and as a result of certain other factors  including that former old infinity directors constituted a majority of the combined company s board of directors and all members of the combined company s executive management were from old infinity  old infinity was deemed to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of assets and a recapitalization in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  for all purposes  including sec reporting  our financial statements for periods prior to the merger reflect the historical results of old infinity  and not dpi  and our financial statements for all subsequent periods reflect the results of the combined company 
in addition  because the business conducted by the combined company became the one operated by old infinity prior to the completion of the merger  the discussion below describes the business of old infinity prior to completion of the merger and the business of the combined company after the merger 
unless specifically noted otherwise  as used herein  the terms infinity  we  us and our refer to the combined company after the merger and the business of old infinity prior to the merger  and dpi refers to the business of discovery partners international  inc prior to completion of the merger 
business overview our mission is to discover  develop  and deliver to patients best in class medicines for the treatment of cancer and related conditions 
a best in class drug refers to a drug  among all drugs within a class of drugs that operate through a particular target or molecular mechanism in the body to affect a particular disease  that is superior to all of the other drugs in the class by virtue of its superior efficacy  superior safety  ease of administration  or some combination of the foregoing 
we have built a pipeline of innovative product candidates for multiple cancer indications  all of which represent proprietary applications of our expertise in small molecule 
table of contents drug technologies 
we believe that our small molecule discovery and development capabilities  strategic alliances  team of highly experienced management and scientists  and corporate culture form the basis of our potential long term competitive advantage in seeking to deliver best in class medicines to patients 
our lead product candidate  retaspimycin hydrochloride for injection formerly known as ipi  or retaspimycin  is an intravenously administered small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein  or hsp hsp is a molecule that maintains the structure and activity of specific proteins  known as client proteins of hsp  specific mutations in  or the aberrant expression of  these client proteins result in many types of cancer 
hsp enables the survival of the cancer cell by allowing the client protein to continue functioning 
we believe that the inhibition of hsp has broad therapeutic potential for patients with solid tumors and blood related cancers  including those that are resistant to other drugs 
as of february   retaspimycin is being evaluated as a single agent in three disease focused clinical trials  including a phase trial in patients with metastatic and or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors gist and other soft tissue sarcomas  the phase portion of a phase trial in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer nsclc  and a phase trial in patients with hormone resistant prostate cancer hrpc 
we are also conducting a phase b clinical trial of retaspimycin in combination with taxotere docetaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we currently expect to initiate additional clinical trials of retaspimycin during  including a phase clinical trial in gist in the third quarter of pending ongoing consultation with advisors and regulatory authorities and analysis of data from the ongoing phase trial  and one or more phase clinical trials in additional solid tumor indications 
we also intend to begin a phase clinical trial of ipi  an orally available inhibitor of hsp  in the second quarter of we are pursuing our hsp program in collaboration with medimmune  inc  a division of astrazeneca plc 
we use the term medimmune az to identify our hsp collaborator 
our next most advanced program is directed against the hedgehog signaling pathway  or hedgehog pathway 
normally  the hedgehog pathway regulates tissue and organ formation during embryonic development 
when abnormally activated during adulthood  however  the hedgehog pathway is believed to play a central role in allowing the proliferation and survival of certain cancer causing cells  and is implicated in many of the most deadly cancers 
the lead candidate in our hedgehog pathway program  ipi  has shown potent and selective inhibition of the hedgehog pathway as well as anti tumor activity in preclinical models 
we intend to file an investigational new drug  or ind  application for ipi by the third quarter of and to commence a phase clinical trial shortly thereafter 
we also have other research programs that target cancer and related conditions  including a program being conducted in collaboration with the novartis institutes for biomedical research  or novartis  to identify small molecule compounds that inhibit the bcl family of proteins 
we have incurred net losses since inception as we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development  including early stage clinical trials 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to expend substantial resources seeking to successfully research  develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approval for  market and sell our drug candidates 
we expect that  in the near term  we will incur substantial losses relating primarily to our efforts to advance the development of retaspimycin  ipi and ipi collaboration agreements in august  we entered into a product development and commercialization agreement with medimmune az to jointly develop and commercialize cancer drugs targeting hsp and the hedgehog pathway 
under the terms of this agreement  we share equally with medimmune az all development costs  as well as potential profits and losses  from any future marketed products 
medimmune az made non refundable  up front payments totaling million to us in order to obtain co exclusive rights to the hsp and hedgehog pathway development programs 
in november  we regained from medimmune az all development and worldwide commercialization rights under our hedgehog pathway program on a royalty free basis  and 
table of contents medimmune az s funding obligations under this program will end in may we continue to collaborate with medimmune az on our hsp program  and could receive up to million in milestone payments if certain late stage development and sales objectives are achieved for products resulting arising from that program 
if any products are successfully developed under the collaboration  we have the right to co promote these products in the united states  with our promotional costs being included among those that are shared under the collaboration 
we may opt out of the hsp program  in which case we would receive a royalty on sales of any products arising from the program instead of profits and losses 
in february  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis to discover  develop and commercialize drugs targeting bcl protein family members for the treatment of a broad range of cancers 
novartis paid us a million up front license fee  an affiliate of novartis made a million equity investment in us  and novartis committed to provide us research funding of approximately million over the initial two year research term  which expired in february novartis had the right to extend the research term for up to two additional one year terms  under which novartis could have obligated us to provide up to five full time equivalents  at novartis expense  to enable the full transition of the bcl inhibitor program to novartis 
novartis chose not to exercise its option for these one year extensions  thus  the research term ended in february and we have no further performance obligations to novartis 
as a result  we expect to recognize million of the up front license fee as revenue in the year ended december  novartis has agreed to make milestone payments totaling over million if certain specified research  development and commercialization milestones are achieved for multiple products for multiple indications  such that total payments to us could exceed million 
novartis has also agreed to pay us royalties upon successful commercialization of any products developed under the alliance 
once a clinical candidate is identified under the collaboration  we may request to participate in clinical development and  if such request is agreed upon by novartis  novartis will fund agreed upon development costs that are incurred by us 
we also have a non exclusive right to detail bcl family inhibitor products in the united states  with our detailing costs to be reimbursed by novartis 
we have also entered into technology access alliances with amgen inc  or amgen  novartis international pharmaceutical ltd  or novartis international  and johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  a division of janssen pharmaceutical nv  or j j  relating to our diversity oriented synthesis technology 
as of december   we have successfully completed all of our obligations to our partners under these agreements 
we do  however  have the right to receive milestone payments under two of these agreements if our alliance partner develops and successfully commercializes products based upon certain compounds licensed to them under the applicable agreement 
financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  and contract service revenue received from our collaboration partners 
where the agreement with a collaboration partner  such as our agreement with novartis  provides that the partner will provide research funding for our research and development efforts  we recognize this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
if we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents research development expense since inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on cancer drugs 
our primary research and development programs include retaspimycin  an hsp inhibitor that is currently in clinical development for metastatic and or unresectable gist  advanced nsclc  hormone resistant prostate cancer and malignant melanoma  ipi  a second generation oral hsp inhibitor for which we have commenced investigational new drug  or ind  enabling studies  ipi  the lead candidate in our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program  for which we have commenced ind enabling studies  and our bcl program 
our hsp program is being conducted in collaboration with medimmune az and our bcl program is being conducted in collaboration with novartis 
we previously had collaborated with medimmune az on our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program  but medimmune az elected to opt out of participation in that program in november our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  including consultants and contract research organizations  laboratory supplies and materials  manufacturing drug candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 
under our collaboration with medimmune az  we share research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
this cost sharing arrangement also applies to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program through may  which is six months from when medimmune az opted out of that program 
because this is a cost sharing arrangement  we record payments that we receive from medimmune az for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
general administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  business development  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications and human resources functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining and overseeing our intellectual property portfolio  which include the salaries of in house patent counsel  the cost of external counsel and the associated filing and maintenance fees 
other income expense interest expense and other interest and investment income primarily consist of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  and interest expense  which includes amortization of warrants 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued drug development costs  assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition to date  our revenues have been generated under research collaboration agreements and  accordingly  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
we divide agreements containing multiple elements into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborative partner and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
for these agreements  we allocate the consideration that we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values or  in some cases  the residual method  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
we recognize research and development funding as earned over the period of effort 
we regularly consider whether events warrant a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would cause us to modify the period of time over which we recognize revenues from the up front license fees paid to us under that agreement and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 
through december   we have not made any such changes 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone and the milestone is at risk for both parties 
if any of these conditions is not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee  and in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenues to date 
we exercise our judgment in determining whether an agreement contains multiple elements and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognize revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 

table of contents research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
we have entered into certain collaboration agreements in which expenses are shared with the collaborator  and others in which we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of the collaborator 
we record all of these expenses as research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments from the collaborator for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we make payments to the collaborator  we will record our payments to the collaborator for its share of the development effort as additional research and development expense 
if the arrangement provides for reimbursement of research and development expenses  we record the reimbursement as revenue 
our collaboration with medimmune az is a cost sharing arrangement  our collaboration with novartis provides for the reimbursement of our research and development expenses 
accrued drug development costs as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations and clinical trial sites in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or underestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the extent of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
to date  we believe that have been able to reasonably estimate these costs 
as the activities being performed by external service providers increase  such as for additional clinical trials and drug manufacturing activities  it will become increasingly difficult for us to estimate these costs  and our estimates of expenses for future periods may  consequently  be over or underaccrued

prior to the completion of the dpi merger in september  our common stock had never been publicly traded 
prior to that date  the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes was determined by old infinity s board of directors with input from management 
because we were not profitable and did not have significant revenue  we believed that a key factor in determining changes in the fair value of our common stock was the stage of  and changes in  our clinical pipeline 
in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  the progression of a drug candidate from preclinical development into clinical trials and the progression from one phase of clinical trials to the next may increase the enterprise s fair value 
in addition to this factor  old infinity s board of directors determined the fair market value of our common stock based on other objective and subjective factors  including its knowledge and experience in valuing early stage life sciences companies  comparative values of public companies  discounted for the risk and limited liquidity provided for in the shares subject to the options we had issued  pricing of private sales of our preferred stock  prior valuations of stock grants  the effect of events that had occurred between the times of such determinations  and economic trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries specifically  and general economic trends 
from december  until the closing of the merger  in addition to the foregoing factors  the board of directors considered contemporaneous estimations of the fair value of our common stock using the probability weighted expected return method  as of december   and again as of march  to estimate the increase in our value created by our collaboration with novartis 
these valuation analyses and the resulting estimates of our enterprise value were based on the market valuation method  specifically the guideline company approach 
the enterprise value was allocated to the different classes of our equity instruments using the probability weighted expected return method 
upon the announcement of the proposed merger with dpi on april   old infinity s board of directors began considering the price of dpi s common stock in determining fair market value 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of stock options  including selecting the inputs we use in the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted or sold and the associated compensation charge we record in our financial statements 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss carryforwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization

for the years ended december  change change revenue research and development expense general and administrative expense interest expense interest and investment income debt extinguishment charge income taxes revenue our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from medimmune az upon entry into our strategic alliance in august  million related to the amortization of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under our bcl collaboration entered into with novartis in february  and million related to the acceptance of compounds by novartis international under our technology access agreement 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization of the up front license fee received from medimmune az upon entry into our strategic alliance in august  million in license fees received upon the amendment of our technology access agreement with amgen in july  
table of contents million related to the amortization of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under our bcl collaboration entered into with novartis in february  million related to the acceptance of compounds by novartis international under our technology access agreement  and million related to the acceptance of compounds to j j under our technology access agreement 
research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expense is primarily attributable to an increase of million in reimbursable amounts from medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement  which are recorded as a credit to research and development expense 
this increase in reimbursable amounts was principally the result of costs under the medimmune az collaboration being shared for only four months of the year ended december  notwithstanding the amounts reimbursable by medimmune az  we recorded an increase of million in drug development costs as our hsp and hedgehog programs have advanced  and an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  which was driven by the hiring of new research and development personnel  annual base salary increases and larger annual stock option grants 
the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the last two years 
these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  drug development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies and clinical trial costs 
in addition  for the hsp and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs  these expenses include credits of approximately million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   attributable to amounts reimbursable by medimmune az following entry into our collaboration agreement in august we did not track research and development expense by program in the year ended december  those expenses were  however  largely related to our hsp program 
program year ended december  year ended december  hsp million million hedgehog pathway inhibitors million million bcl million million we do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs or represent what any other future drug development program we initiate may cost 
we expect our hsp program expenses to increase as we advance retaspimycin into additional  and later stage  clinical trials and as ipi enters clinical development 
in addition  we expect expenses for our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program to increase as ipi enters clinical development  and as a result of medimmune az not funding half of the expenses of this program after may because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs  the anticipated completion dates of these programs  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence  if at all  from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates 

table of contents a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our drug development programs on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
any failure by us or one of our strategic alliance partners to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was driven by the hiring of new general and administrative personnel  annual base salary increases and larger annual stock option grants  and an increase of million in patent costs  tax service expense  and miscellaneous tax expense  including state franchise taxes 
interest expense interest expense decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the repayment in december of all of our outstanding debt to oxford finance corporation  or oxford  and horizon technology funding company llc  or horizon 
interest and investment income interest and investment income increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of our higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities during  which was  in turn  primarily attributable to amounts received upon completion of the merger and up front license fees received from medimmune az and novartis in connection with our collaborations 
debt extinguishment charge in connection with the early retirement of our outstanding indebtedness to oxford and horizon in december  we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of approximately million during the year ended december  this debt extinguishment charge represents the write off of the unamortized portion of the warrants that we issued to oxford and horizon when we originally entered into these debt facilities  as well as a prepayment penalty 
income taxes our income tax expense of approximately million for the year ended december  relates to the alternative minimum tax driven by new collaborations we entered into during the year ended december  we did not incur any income tax expense in  and we do not expect to incur income tax expense in

r stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  and an increase of million in external costs for toxicology studies and clinical trials of retaspimycin and our hedgehog pathway inhibitor compounds 
during the year ended december   our research and development expense included a credit of approximately million attributable to amounts reimbursable by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement  as well as a million asset impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of with respect to certain laboratory equipment that we were no longer using 

table of contents general and administrative expense the increases in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  were primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including sfas no 
r compensation expense for general and administrative employees  and new employees we hired in anticipation of becoming a public company  and an increase of million in outside service fees  including audit  legal and consulting  primarily related to our becoming a public company and becoming compliant with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
interest expense interest expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of borrowings made in under our debt facilities with oxford and horizon 
we repaid in full all of our outstanding debt to oxford and horizon in december interest and investment income interest and investment income increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of our higher balance of cash and available for sale securities at december  the increased cash and available for sale securities balance was primarily attributable to amounts we received upon completion of the merger  up front license fees received from medimmune az and novartis in connection with our collaborations  and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest and income on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  license fees  expense reimbursement under our collaborations  contract service payments and debt to fund our operations 
because our drug candidates are at an early stage of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 
our cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and working capital are as follows december  december  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities working capital years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above financing activities cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all of the periods presented was the funding of our net loss 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable  as well as changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 

table of contents in january  we received million from medimmune az  representing the second half of the up front license fee related to our collaboration agreement  which was recorded as an unbilled receivable as of december  cash flow from operations for the year ended december  included higher stock based compensation as well as increased net accretion on available for sale securities  as we invested portions of the medimmune az and novartis up front license fees and the proceeds from the dpi merger into available for sale securities 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  also included an increase to accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily due to higher research and development activities 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  included an increase of million in deferred revenue due to the collaboration agreements with medimmune az and novartis 
in september  we received million from medimmune az  representing the first half of the up front license fee related to our collaboration agreement 
in february  we received million from novartis for the up front license fee related to our collaboration agreement 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of available for sale securities and million in sales and maturities of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures in the year ended december  primarily consisted of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for a new process scale up laboratory 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at december  will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into our currently planned operating and capital requirements primarily include the need for working capital to  among other things continue clinical development of retaspimycin  perform preclinical work on  and commence clinical development of  ipi  perform preclinical work on  and commence clinical development of  ipi  and advance our additional discovery programs 
we may  however  need to raise additional funds before that date if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations or if we do not receive the milestone or other payments we expect to receive from third parties 
this could occur for many reasons  including some or all of our drug candidates fail in clinical or preclinical studies and we are forced to seek additional drug candidates  our drug candidates require more extensive clinical or preclinical testing than we currently expect  we advance more of our drug candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials  we advance more preclinical drug candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our drug candidates are higher than anticipated  we are required  or consider it advisable  to acquire or license intellectual property rights from one or more third parties  or we acquire or license rights to additional drug candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties 
while we expect to seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity or debt securities  we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  the terms of our financings may be dilutive to  or otherwise adversely affect  holders of our common stock  or they may impact our ability to 
table of contents make capital expenditures or incur additional debt 
we may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties  or through project financing 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs  including some or all of our drug candidates 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond equipment loans and capital leases  including interest software contract obligation operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above  long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling approximately million at december  are not included in the contractual obligations table because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  asset backed securities  corporate obligations and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
