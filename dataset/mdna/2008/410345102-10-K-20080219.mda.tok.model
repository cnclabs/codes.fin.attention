overview our company we are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands  including hanes  champion  playtex  bali  just my size  barely there and wonderbra 
we design  manufacture  source and sell a broad range of apparel essentials such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  hosiery  casualwear and activewear 
according to npd  our brands hold either the number one or number two us market position by sales in most product categories in which we compete  on a rolling year end basis as of december  our segments our operations are managed in five operating segments  each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes innerwear  outerwear  hosiery  international and other 
these segments are organized principally by product category and geographic location 
management of each segment is responsible for the assets and operations of these businesses 
innerwear 
the innerwear segment focuses on core apparel essentials  and consists of products such as women s intimate apparel  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  thermals and sleepwear  marketed under well known brands that are trusted by consumers 
we are an intimate apparel category leader in the united states with our hanes  playtex  bali  just my size  barely there and wonderbra brands

our net sales for the year ended december  from our innerwear segment were billion  representing approximately of total segment net sales

we compete in the hosiery market by striving to offer superior values and executing integrated marketing activities  as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery products 
we market hosiery products under our hanes  l eggs and just my size brands 
our net sales for the year ended december  from our hosiery segment were million  representing approximately of total segment net sales 
we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry although the decline has slowed in recent years and with shifts in consumer preferences 

table of contents international 
international includes products that span across the innerwear  outerwear and hosiery reportable segments and include products marketed under the hanes  champion  wonderbra  playtex  rinbros  bali and stedman brands 
our net sales for the year ended december  from our international segment were million  representing approximately of total segment net sales and included sales in latin america  asia  canada and europe 
japan  canada and mexico are our largest international markets  and we also have sales offices in india and china 
other 
our net sales for the year ended december  in our other segment were million  representing approximately of total segment net sales and are comprised of sales of nonfinished products such as fabric and certain other materials in the united states and latin america in order to maintain asset utilization at certain manufacturing facilities 
our operating results are subject to some variability 
generally  our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items 
sales are typically higher in the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year 
socks  hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during this period as a result of cooler weather  back to school shopping and holidays 
sales levels in a period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand 
our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us 
our results of operations are also impacted by fluctuations and volatility in the price of cotton and the timing of actual spending for our media  advertising and promotion expenses 
media  advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
while we do enter into short term supply agreements and hedges in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices  although cotton represents only of our cost of sales 
cotton prices  which were approximately cents per pound in  returned to the ten year historical average of approximately cents per pound in taking into consideration the agreements that we currently have in effect and cotton costs currently included in inventory  we expect our cost of cotton to average cents per pound through august  with the first quarter being lower and the third quarter being higher 
business and industry trends our businesses are highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
competition generally is based upon price  brand name recognition  product quality  selection  service and purchasing convenience 
while the majority of our core styles continue from year to year  with variations only in color  fabric or design details  other products such as intimate apparel and sheer hosiery have a heavier emphasis on style and innovation 
our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers  as well as department stores  specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell apparel essentials products under private labels that compete directly with our brands 
our distribution channels include direct to consumer sales at our outlet stores  national chains and department stores and warehouse clubs  mass merchandise outlets and international sales 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net sales were to mass merchants  were to national chains and department stores  were direct to consumers  were in our international segment and were to other retail channels such as embellishers  specialty retailers  warehouse clubs and sporting goods stores 
the retailers to which we sell our products have grown larger  partly due to retailer consolidation  and  as such  the number of retailers to which we sell our products has declined 
for the year ended december   for example  our top ten customers accounted for of our net sales and our top customer  wal mart  accounted for over billion of our sales 
our largest customers in the year ended december  were wal mart  target and kohl s  which accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
the growth in retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek to have greater concessions in 
table of contents their purchase of our products  while they can be increasingly demanding that we provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis 
to counteract these effects  it has become increasingly important to increase operational efficiency and lower costs 
as discussed below  for example  we are moving more of our supply chain to lower cost locations to lower the costs of our operational structure 
anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response to consumer preferences remains an important element of our business 
in recent years  we have experienced changes in our net sales  revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in consumer preferences and trends 
for example  we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry although the decline has slowed in recent years and with shifts in consumer preferences 
the hosiery segment only comprised of our net sales in the year ended december  however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales  revenues or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
our key business strategies our core strategies are to build our largest  strongest brands in core categories by driving innovation in key items  to continually reduce our costs by consolidating our organization and globalizing our supply chain and to use our strong  consistent cash flows to fund business growth  supply chain reorganization and debt reduction and to repurchase shares to offset dilution 
specifically  we intend to focus on the following strategic initiatives increase the strength of our brands with consumers 
driving growth platforms across categories is a major element of our strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars 
we intend to increase our level of marketing support behind our key brands with targeted  effective advertising and marketing campaigns 
for example  in  we launched a number of new advertising and marketing initiatives 
we featured jennifer love hewitt in a new television  print and online advertising campaign that began in march in support of the launch of the hanes all over comfort bra with comfortsoft straps 
the campaign includes new television  print and online ads 
we launched our latest look who advertising campaign featuring cuba gooding jr 
and michael jordan in july  in support of the new hanes comfortsoft collection for men  which includes the hanes comfortsoft undershirt and comfortsoft underwear 
also in july  we launched the hanes comfortzone tour  a mobile marketing initiative focused helping men experience comfortsoft product innovation first hand 
in november  we launched the first campaign for our champion brand since  a national advertising campaign featuring a new tagline  how you play  designed to capture the everyday moments of fun and sport in a series of cool and hip lifestyle images 
in the spring of  we launched a new live beautifully campaign for our bali brand  which features bali bras and panties from its passion for comfort  seductive curve and cotton creations lines 
we launched an innovative and expressive advertising and marketing campaign called girl talk in september in which confident  everyday women talk about their breasts  in support of our playtex hour and playtex secrets product lines 
in october  we announced a year strategic alliance with the walt disney company that includes basic apparel exclusivity for the hanes and champion brands  product co branding  attraction sponsorships and other brand visibility and signage at walt disney parks and resorts properties 
our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends will continue to be key to our success 
our design  research and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we intend to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the apparel essentials industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends 
strengthen our retail relationships 
we intend to expand our market share at large  national retailers by applying our extensive category and product knowledge  leveraging our use of multi functional customer management teams and developing new customer specific programs such as c by champion for target 
our goal is to strengthen and deepen our existing strategic relationships with retailers and 
table of contents develop new strategic relationships 
additionally  we plan to expand distribution by providing manufacturing and production of apparel essentials products to specialty stores and other distribution channels  such as direct to consumer through the internet 
develop a lower cost efficient supply chain 
as a provider of high volume products  we are continually seeking to improve our cost competitiveness and operating flexibility through supply chain initiatives 
over the next several years  we will continue to transition additional parts of our supply chain to lower cost locations in central america  the caribbean basin and asia in an effort to optimize our cost structure 
we intend to continue to self manufacture core products where we can protect or gain a significant cost advantage through scale or in cases where we seek to protect proprietary processes and technology 
we plan to continue to selectively source product categories that do not meet these criteria from third party manufacturers 
we expect that in future years our supply chain will become more balanced across the eastern and western hemispheres 
we expect that these changes in our supply chain will result in significant cost efficiencies and increased asset utilization 
our restructuring activities are discussed in more detail below 
create a more integrated  focused company 
historically  we have had a decentralized operating structure  with many distinct operating units 
we are in the process of consolidating functions  such as purchasing  finance  manufacturing sourcing  planning  marketing and product development  across all of our product categories in the united states 
we also are in the process of integrating our distribution operations and information technology systems 
we believe that these initiatives will streamline our operations  improve our inventory management  reduce costs  standardize processes and allow us to distribute our products more effectively to retailers 
we expect that our initiative to integrate our technology systems also will provide us with more timely information  increasing our ability to allocate capital and manage our business more effectively 
we expect to continue to incur costs associated with the integration of these systems across our company over the next several years 
this process involves the integration or replacement of eight independent information technology platforms so that our business functions are served by fewer platforms 
supply chain consolidation and globalization over the past several years  we have undertaken a variety of restructuring efforts designed to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs 
we have closed plant locations  reduced our workforce  and relocated some of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations in central america and asia 
for example  during the year ended december   in furtherance of our efforts to execute our consolidation and globalization strategy  we approved actions to close manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers affecting  employees in the dominican republic  mexico  the united states  brazil and canada 
in addition  management and administrative positions are being eliminated  with the majority of these positions based in the united states 
we also have recognized accelerated depreciation with respect to owned or leased assets associated with manufacturing facilities and five distribution centers which we anticipate closing in the next three to five years as part of our consolidation and globalization strategy 
while we believe that these efforts have had and will continue to have a beneficial impact on our operational efficiency and cost structure  we have incurred significant costs to implement these initiatives 
in particular  we have recorded charges for severance and other employment related obligations relating to workforce reductions  as well as payments in connection with lease and other contract terminations 
these amounts are included in the cost of sales  restructuring and selling  general and administrative expenses lines of our statements of income 
we acquired our second offshore textile plant  the  employee textile manufacturing operations of industrias duraflex  sa de sa  in san juan opico  el salvador 
this acquisition provides a textile base in central america from which to expand and leverage our large scale as well as supply our sewing network throughout central america 
also  we announced plans to build a textile production plant in nanjing  china  which will be our first company owned textile production facility in asia 
the nanjing textile facility will enable us to expand and leverage our production scale in asia as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres 
in december  we acquired the employee sheer hosiery facility in las lourdes  el salvador of inversiones bonaventure  sa de sa for the past years  these operations had been a primary contract sewing operation 
table of contents for hanes and l eggs hosiery products 
the acquisition streamlines a critical part of our overall hosiery supply chain and is part of our strategy to operate larger  company owned production facilities 
as a result of the restructuring actions taken since our spin off from sara lee on september   our cost structure was reduced and efficiencies improved  generating savings of million during the year ended december  of the seven manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in  two were closed in and five were closed in of the manufacturing facilities and distribution centers approved for closure in  were closed in and are expected to close in for more information about our restructuring actions  see note  titled restructuring to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
as further plans are developed and approved by management and in some cases our board of directors  we expect to recognize additional restructuring costs to eliminate duplicative functions within the organization and transition a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations 
as a result of these efforts  we expect to incur approximately million in restructuring and related charges over the three year period following the spin off from sara lee  of which approximately half is expected to be noncash 
as of december   we have recognized approximately million in restructuring and related charges related to these efforts 
of these charges  million relates to employee termination and other benefits  million relates to accelerated depreciation of buildings and equipment for facilities that have been or will be closed and million relates to lease termination costs 
components of net sales and expense net sales we generate net sales by selling apparel essentials such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  hosiery  casualwear and activewear 
our net sales are recognized net of discounts  coupons  rebates  volume based incentives and cooperative advertising costs 
we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
net sales include an estimate for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience 
we also offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers that are recorded as reductions to net sales 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished goods  which consists of labor  raw materials such as cotton and petroleum based products and overhead costs such as depreciation on owned facilities and equipment 
our cost of sales also includes finished goods sourced from third party manufacturers that supply us with products based on our designs as well as charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
our costs of sales do not include shipping costs  comprised of payments to third party shippers  or handling costs  comprised of warehousing costs in our distribution facilities  and thus our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include selling  advertising  costs of shipping  handling and distribution to our customers  research and development  rent on leased facilities  depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and other general and administrative expenses 
also included for periods presented prior to the spin off on september  are allocations of corporate expenses that consist of expenses for business insurance  medical insurance  employee benefit plan amounts and  because we were part of sara lee those periods  allocations from sara lee for certain centralized administration costs for treasury  real estate  accounting  auditing  tax  risk management  human resources and benefits administration 
these allocations of centralized administration costs were determined on bases that we and sara lee considered to be reasonable 
table of contents and take into consideration and include relevant operating profit  fixed assets  sales and payroll 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance and legal expenses 
restructuring we have from time to time closed facilities and reduced headcount  including in connection with previously announced restructuring and business transformation plans 
we refer to these activities as restructuring actions 
when we decide to close facilities or reduce headcount  we take estimated charges for such restructuring  including charges for exited non cancelable leases and other contractual obligations  as well as severance and benefits 
if the actual charge is different from the original estimate  an adjustment is recognized in the period such change in estimate is identified 
other expenses our other expenses include charges such as losses on early extinguishment of debt and certain other non operating items 
interest expense  net as part of the spin off from sara lee on september   we incurred billion of debt in the form of the senior secured credit facility  the second lien credit facility and a bridge loan facility the bridge loan facility  billion of which we paid to sara lee 
in december  we issued million of floating rate senior notes and the proceeds were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the bridge loan facility 
on november   we entered into the receivables facility which provides for up to million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing  all of which we borrowed and used to repay a portion of the senior secured credit facility 
as a result  our interest expense in the current and future periods will be substantially higher than in periods prior to our spin off from sara lee 
as part of our historical relationship with sara lee  we engaged in intercompany borrowings 
we are no longer able to borrow from sara lee 
our interest expense is net of interest income 
interest income is the return we earned on our cash and cash equivalents and  historically  on money we loaned to sara lee as part of its corporate cash management practices 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period and can be materially impacted by  among other things changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the tax characteristics of our earnings  the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the united states  which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid  the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business  and the expiration of the tax incentives for manufacturing operations in puerto rico  which were no longer in effect after july  inflation and changing prices we believe that changes in net sales and in net income that have resulted from inflation or deflation have not been material during the periods presented 
there is no assurance  however  that inflation or deflation will not materially affect us in the future 
cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of our 
table of contents products and is subject to fluctuations in prices 
further discussion of the market sensitivity of cotton is included in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
highlights from the year ended december  total net sales in the year ended december  were higher by million at billion compared to the year ended december  net sales for three of our four largest brands  hanes  champion and bali  all increased in operating profit was million in the year ended december   up from million in the year ended december  the higher operating profit was a result of increased sales  cost reduction initiatives and lower spin off and related charges which more than offset higher costs associated with investments in our strategic initiatives and higher restructuring and related charges 
diluted earnings per share were in the year ended december   compared with in the year ended december  the full year decline reflected higher interest expense as a result of our independent structure since the spin off from sara lee on september   higher restructuring costs and a higher tax rate 
using cash flow from operating activities  we repaid a net million of long term debt  repurchased million of company stock  and voluntarily contributed million to our qualified pension plans during we completed the final separation of pension plan assets and liabilities from those of our former parent in as a result  our us qualified pension plans are approximately funded as of december  we approved actions to close manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers in the dominican republic  mexico  the united states  brazil and canada during in addition  we completed previously announced restructuring actions in the net impact of these actions was to reduce income before taxes for the year ended december  by million 
in february  we entered into a first amendment to our senior secured credit facility with our lenders which primarily lowered the borrowing applicable margin with respect to the term b loan facility from to on libor based loans and from to on base rate loans 
in august  we acquired our second offshore textile plant  the  employee textile manufacturing operations of industrias duraflex  sa de sa  in san juan opico  el salvador 
this acquisition provides a textile base in central america from which to expand and leverage our large scale as well as supply our sewing network throughout central america 
also  we announced plans in october to build a textile production plant in nanjing  china  which will be our first company owned textile production facility in asia 
the nanjing textile facility will enable us to expand and leverage our production scale in asia as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres 
in october  we announced a year strategic alliance with the walt disney company that includes basic apparel exclusivity for the hanes and champion brands  product co branding  attraction sponsorships and other brand visibility and signage at disney properties 
the alliance included the naming rights for the stadium at disney s wide world of sports complex  now known as champion stadium 
in november  we entered into the receivables facility  which provides for up to million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing  limited to the availability of eligible receivables  and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables and which we expect will reduce our overall borrowing costs in the future 
in december  we acquired the employee sheer hosiery facility in las lourdes  el salvador of inversiones bonaventure  sa de cv for the past years  these operations had been a primary contract sewing operation for hanes and l eggs hosiery products 
the acquisition streamlines a critical 
table of contents part of our overall hosiery supply chain and is part of our strategy to operate larger  company owned production facilities 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  the information presented below for the year ended december  was derived from our consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited information presented for the twelve months ended december  which twelve month period we refer to as in this consolidated results of operation year ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  section and the section entitled operating results by business segment year ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  is presented due to the change in our fiscal year end and was derived by combining the six months ended july  and the six months ended december  year ended year ended december  december  higher percent lower change unaudited dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits restructuring operating profit other expenses interest expense  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net sales year ended year ended december  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands net sales consolidated net sales were higher by million or in compared to our outerwear  international and other segment net sales were higher by million  million and million  respectively  and were offset by lower segment net sales in innerwear of million and hosiery of million the overall higher net sales were primarily due to double digit growth in sales volume in champion brand sales  growth in hanes brand casualwear  socks  sleepwear  intimate apparel and men s underwear sales and bali brand intimate apparel sales 
our champion brand sales have increased by double digits in each of the last three years 
the higher net sales were offset primarily by lower sales of promotional t shirts sold primarily through our embellishment channel  lower playtex brand intimate apparel sales  lower hanes brand kids underwear sales and lower licensed men s underwear sales in the department store channel 
our strategy of investing in our largest and strongest brands is generating growth 
in  we launched a number of new advertising and marketing initiatives for our top brands  including our hanes comfortsoft campaigns  bali passion for comfort  playtex girl talk and most recently our champion how you play 
table of contents advertising campaign which is the first campaign for the brand since we also announced a year strategic alliance with the walt disney company that includes basic apparel exclusivity for the hanes and champion brands  product co branding  attraction sponsorships and other brand visibility and signage at disney properties 
the alliance included the naming rights for the stadium at disney s wide world of sports complex  now known as champion stadium 
net sales in the hosiery segment were lower primarily due to lower sales of the l eggs brand to mass retailers and food and drug stores 
we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry although the decline has slowed in recent years and with shifts in consumer preferences 
the higher net sales from our other segment primarily resulted from an immaterial change in the way we recognized sales to third party suppliers in the full year change was reflected in with a million impact on net sales and minimal impact on net income 
the changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales of million in compared to gross profit year ended year ended december  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands gross profit as a percent of net sales  our gross profit percentage was in compared to in the lower gross profit percentage was primarily due to higher cotton costs of million  higher excess and obsolete inventory costs of million  million of higher accelerated depreciation  million of unfavorable product sales mix and million of higher start up and shut down costs associated with the consolidation and globalization of our supply chain 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by higher incentives of million of which million resulted from a change in the classification of certain sales incentives in which were previously classified as media  advertising and promotion expenses in this change in classification was made in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  because the estimated fair value of the identifiable benefit was no longer obtained beginning in cotton prices  which were approximately cents per pound in  returned to the ten year historical average of approximately cents per pound in the higher excess and obsolete inventory costs in compared to are primarily attributable to million of costs associated with the rationalization of our sock product category offerings and million related to exiting a licensing arrangement for a kids underwear program 
the remaining million of higher excess and obsolete costs aggregates all other product categories as part of our continuous evaluation of both inventory levels and simplification of our product category offerings 
the higher accelerated depreciation in was a result of facilities closed or that will be closed in connection with our consolidation and globalization strategy 
these higher costs were offset primarily by savings from our cost reduction initiatives and prior restructuring actions of million  lower allocations of overhead costs of million  million of improved plant performance  million of higher sales volume  lower duty costs of million  primarily due to the receipt of million in duty refunds relating to duties paid several years ago  and million of lower spending in numerous other areas 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended year ended december  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses

our media  advertising and promotion map expenses were lower by million  primarily with respect to non media related map expenses 
the lower non media related map expenses are primarily attributable to million of cost reduction initiatives and better deployment of these resources and million due to a change in the classification of certain sales incentives in which were classified as map expenses in map expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
in addition  pension expense was reduced by million in as a result of the final separation of our pension assets and liabilities from those of sara lee 
our cost reduction efforts during the year have allowed us to offset million of higher stand alone expenses associated with being an independent company and make investments in our strategic initiatives resulting in million of higher media related map expenses and million in higher technology consulting expenses in in addition  our allocations of overhead costs were million lower during compared to accelerated depreciation was million higher in as a result of facilities closed or that will be closed in connection with our consolidation and globalization strategy 
gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits year ended year ended december  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands gain on curtailment of postretirement benefits in december  we notified retirees and employees of the phase out of premium subsidies for early retiree medical coverage and move to an access only plan for early retirees by the end of we also eliminated the medical plan for retirees ages and older as a result of coverage available under the expansion of medicare with part d drug coverage and eliminated future postretirement life benefits 
the gain on curtailment in represented the unrecognized amounts associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of the participants prior to the december amendments 
in  we recognized million in postretirement benefit income which was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily representing the amortization of negative prior service costs  which was partially offset by service costs  interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and actuarial gains and losses accumulated in the plan 
in december  we terminated the existing plan and recognized a final gain on curtailment of plan benefits of million 
concurrently with the termination of the existing plan  we established a new access only plan that is fully paid by the participants 
restructuring year ended year ended december  december  higher percent lower change dollars in thousands restructuring during  we approved actions to close manufacturing facilities and three distribution centers affecting  employees in the dominican republic  mexico  the united states  brazil and canada  while moving production to lower cost operations in central america and asia

these actions resulted in a charge of million  representing costs associated with the planned termination of  employees  primarily attributable to employee and other termination benefits recognized in accordance with benefit plans previously communicated to the affected employee group 
in addition  we recognized a

this process involves the replacement of eight independent information technology platforms so that our business functions are served by fewer platforms 
while capital spending could vary significantly from year to year  we anticipate that our capital spending over the next three years could be as high as million as we execute our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy and complete the integration and consolidation of our technology systems 
capital spending in any given year over the next three years could be as high as million in excess of our annual depreciation and amortization expense until the completion of actions related to our globalization strategy at which time we would expect our annual capital spending to be relatively comparable to our annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the majority of our capital spending will be focused on growing our supply chain operations in central america  the caribbean basin  and asia 
these locations will enable us to expand and leverage our large production scale as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres 
in  we acquired our second offshore textile plant  the  employee textile manufacturing operations of industrias duraflex  sa de sa  in san juan opico  el salvador 
this acquisition provides a textile base in central america from which to expand and leverage our large scale as well as supply our sewing network throughout central america 
also  we announced plans in to build a textile production plant in nanjing  china  which will be our first company owned textile production facility in asia 
the nanjing textile facility will enable us to expand and leverage our production scale in asia as we balance our supply chain across hemispheres 
in december  we acquired the employee sheer hosiery facility in las lourdes  el salvador of inversiones bonaventure  sa de sa for the past years  these operations had been a primary contract sewing operation for hanes and l eggs hosiery products 
the acquisition streamlines a critical part of our overall hosiery supply chain and is part of our strategy to operate larger  company owned production facilities 
as we continue to add new manufacturing capacity in central america  the caribbean basin and asia  our exposure to events that could disrupt our foreign supply chain  including political instability  acts of war or terrorism or other international events resulting in the disruption of trade  disruptions in shipping and freight forwarding services  increases in oil prices which would increase the cost of shipping  interruptions in the availability of basic services and infrastructure and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  is increased 
disruptions in our foreign supply chain could negatively impact our liquidity by interrupting production in offshore facilities  increasing our cost of sales  disrupting merchandise deliveries  delaying 
table of contents receipt of the products into the united states or preventing us from sourcing our products at all 
depending on timing  these events could also result in lost sales  cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 
as a result of provisions of the pension protection act of  we are required by law  commencing with plan years beginning after  to make larger contributions to our pension plans than sara lee made with respect to these plans in past years 
however  the final separation of our pension plan assets and liabilities from those of sara lee in resulted in a higher total amount of pension assets being transferred to us than was originally estimated prior to the spin off which  together with our voluntary contributions of million in and million in to our pension plans  has resulted in our us qualified pension plans currently being approximately funded which should result in minimal pension funding requirements in the future 
consolidated cash flows the information presented below for the year ended december  was derived from our consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited information presented for the twelve months ended december  is presented due to the change in our fiscal year end and was derived by combining the six months ended july  and the six months ended december  year ended year ended december  december  unaudited dollars in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the higher cash provided from operating activities of million was primarily the result of better management of working capital  partially offset by lower earnings in the business primarily attributable to higher interest expense  a higher effective income tax rate and higher restructuring and related charges which was partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses

net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the higher cash used in investing activities of million was primarily the result of acquiring of the textile manufacturing operations of industrias duraflex  sa de sa in el salvador and a sheer hosiery sewing facility operation in el salvador and slightly higher purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the lower cash used in financing activities of million was primarily the result of the elimination of net transactions with parent companies and related entities 
table of contents subsequent to the spin off from sara lee on september   the incurrence of billion of indebtedness offset by payments of billion to sara lee in connection with the spin off and lower net borrowings and repayments on notes payable in  partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt under credit facilities and share repurchases in on november   we entered into the receivables facility  which provides for borrowings up to million

cash and cash equivalents as of december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively

accounts receivable securitization on november   we entered into the receivables facility  which provides for up to million in funding accounted for as a secured borrowing  limited to the availability of eligible receivables  and is secured by certain domestic trade receivables 
the receivables facility will terminate on november  under the terms of the receivables facility  the company sells  on a revolving basis  certain domestic trade receivables to hbi receivables llc receivables llc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary that in turn uses the trade receivables to secure the borrowings  which are funded through conduits that issue commercial paper in the short term market and are not affiliated with us or through committed bank purchasers if the conduits fail to fund 
the assets and liabilities of receivables llc are fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  and the securitization is treated as a secured borrowing for accounting purposes 
the borrowings under the receivables facility remain outstanding throughout the term of the agreement subject to our maintaining sufficient eligible receivables by continuing to sell trade receivables to receivables llc unless an event of default occurs 
availability of funding under the facility depends primarily upon the eligible outstanding receivables balance 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the receivables facility 
the outstanding balance under the receivables facility is reported on the company s consolidated balance sheet in long term debt based on the three year term of the agreement and the fact that remittances on the receivables do not automatically reduce the outstanding borrowings 
we used all million of the proceeds from the receivables facility to make a prepayment of principal under the senior secured credit facility

at december   we have outstanding hedging arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on million of our floating rate debt at 
we also entered into interest rate swaps tied to the month and month libor rates whereby we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate of million of our floating rate debt at a blended rate of approximately 
approximately of our total debt outstanding at december  is at a fixed or capped rate 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness during the current period related to these instruments 
we use forward exchange and option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies for a portion of our anticipated short term foreign currency denominated transactions 
cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of our products 
we generally purchase our raw materials at market prices 
in the year ended july   we started to use commodity financial instruments  options and forward contracts to hedge the price of cotton  for which there is a high correlation between the hedged item and the hedged instrument 
we generally do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge other raw material commodity prices 
off balance sheet arrangements we engage in off balance sheet arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these off balance sheet arrangements include operating leases for manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space  vehicles and machinery and equipment 
minimum operating lease obligations are scheduled to be paid as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter

due to our current funded status of our pension plans  we are not obligated to make any contributions to the plan in the next year 
the future timing of the pension funding obligations associated with our defined benefit pension and post retirement plans beyond the next year is dependent on a number of factors including investment results and other factors that contribute to future pension expense and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
a discussion of our pension and postretirement plans is included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
our obligations for employee health and property and casualty losses are also excluded from the table 
pension plans in conjunction with the spin off which occurred on september   we established the hanesbrands inc pension and retirement plan  which assumed the portion of the underfunded liabilities and the portion of the assets of pension plans sponsored by sara lee that relate to our employees 
in addition  we assumed sponsorship of certain other sara lee plans and will continue sponsorship of the playtex apparel inc pension plan and the national textiles  llc pension plan 

table of contents since the spin off  we have voluntarily contributed million to our pension plans 
additionally  during we completed the separation of our pension plan assets and liabilities from those of sara lee in accordance with governmental regulations  which resulted in a higher total amount of pension plan assets of approximately million being transferred to us than originally was estimated prior to the spin off 
prior to spin off  the fair value of plan assets included in the annual valuations represented a best estimate based upon a percentage allocation of total assets of the sara lee trust 
our us qualified pension plans are approximately funded as of december  share repurchase program on february   we announced that our board of directors granted authority for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions  and are subject to market conditions  legal requirements and other factors 
additionally  management has been granted authority to establish a trading plan under rule b of the exchange act in connection with share repurchases  which will allow use to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise closed for our company and certain of our officers and employees pursuant to our insider trading policy 
during  we purchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million average price of 
the primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by the exercise of options and vesting of stock unit awards 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  titled summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements  or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors  are the following sales recognition and incentives we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
note d  titled summary of significant accounting policies sales recognition and incentives  to our consolidated financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products 
measuring the cost of these incentives requires  in many cases  estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates 
we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information 
for the year ended december   we changed the manner in which we accounted for cooperative advertising that resulted in a change in the classification from media  advertising and promotion expenses to a reduction of sales 
this change in 
table of contents classification was made in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  because the estimated fair value of the identifiable benefit was no longer obtained beginning in catalog expenses we incur expenses for printing catalogs for our products to aid in our sales efforts 
we initially record these expenses as a prepaid item and charge it against selling  general and administrative expenses over time as the catalog is used 
expenses are recognized at a rate that approximates our historical experience with regard to the timing and amount of sales attributable to a catalog distribution 
inventory valuation we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method for our inventories at december  we carry obsolete  damaged  and excess inventory at the net realizable value  which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates  current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans 
because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time  there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination 
market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change  resulting in further reserve requirements 
a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item  and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
income taxes prior to spin off on september   all income taxes were computed and reported on a separate return basis as if we were not part of sara lee 
deferred taxes were recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
net operating loss carryforwards had been determined in our consolidated financial statements as if we were separate from sara lee  resulting in a different net operating loss carryforward amount than reflected by sara lee 
given our continuing losses in certain geographic locations on a separate return basis  a valuation allowance has been established for the deferred tax assets relating to these specific locations 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  reflecting the historical decisions made by sara lee with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
in periods after the spin off  we may make different decisions as to the amount of earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions  due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements  which may impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and our informed judgment 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to  or further interpretations of  regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur  and these adjustments are included in our consolidated statements of income 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which became effective during the year ended december  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  a company must 
table of contents recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
in conjunction with the spin off  we and sara lee entered into a tax sharing agreement  which allocates responsibilities between us and sara lee for taxes and certain other tax matters 
under the tax sharing agreement  sara lee generally is liable for all us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or before september  sara lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods beginning before september  and ending after september   but only to the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on september  we are generally liable for all other taxes attributable to us 
changes in the amounts payable or receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may impact our tax provision in any period 
within days after sara lee files its final consolidated tax return for the period that includes september   sara lee is required to deliver to us a computation of the amount of deferred taxes attributable to our united states and canadian operations that would be included on our balance sheet as of september  if substituting the amount of deferred taxes as finally determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were included on that balance sheet at the time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then sara lee will be required to pay us the amount of such decrease 
if such substitution causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then we will be required to pay sara lee the amount of such increase 
for purposes of this computation  our deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax benefits including deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards that would be recognized as assets on our balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances  less the amount of deferred tax liabilities including deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences that would be recognized as liabilities on our balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances 
neither we nor sara lee will be required to make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred taxes 
stock compensation we established the hanesbrands inc omnibus incentive plan of  the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  deferred stock units  performance shares and cash to our employees  non employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no r  share based payment 
under sfas r  stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
estimation of stock based compensation for stock options granted  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life 
we use the volatility of peer companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions 
we have utilized the simplified method outlined in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
to estimate expected lives of options granted during the period 
sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which was issued in december  amends sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and gives a limited extension on using the simplified method for valuing stock option grants to eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees 
further  as required under sfas no 
r  we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted  which are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

table of contents defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance plans for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost  plan obligations  plan assets  and how we measure the amount of these costs  see notes and titled defined benefit pension plans and postretirement healthcare and life insurance plans  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the spin off from sara lee which occurred on september   we established the hanesbrands inc pension and retirement plan  which assumed the portion of the underfunded liabilities and the portion of the assets of pension plans sponsored by sara lee that relate to our employees 
in addition  we assumed sponsorship of certain other sara lee plans and will continue sponsorship of the playtex apparel inc pension plan and the national textiles  llc pension plan 
as of january   the benefits under these plans were frozen 
since the spin off  we have voluntarily contributed million to our pension plans 
additionally  during we completed the separation of our pension plan assets and liabilities from those of sara lee in accordance with governmental regulations  which resulted in a higher total amount of pension plan assets of approximately million being transferred to us than originally was estimated prior to the spin off 
as a result  our us qualified pension plans are approximately funded as of december  in december  we changed the postretirement plan benefits to a pass along a higher share of retiree medical costs to all retirees effective february   b eliminate company contributions toward premiums for retiree medical coverage effective december   c eliminate retiree medical coverage options for all current and future retirees age and older and d eliminate future postretirement life benefits 
gains associated with these plan amendments were amortized throughout the year ended december  in anticipation of the effective termination of the medical plan on december  on december  we effectively terminated all retiree medical coverage 
a final gain on curtailment of million was recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the fourth quarter of the year ended december  concurrently with the termination of the existing plan  we established a new access only plan that is fully paid by the participants 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on a company s balance sheet  and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income  effective fiscal years ending after december   which we adopted as of and for the six months ended december  the impact of adopting the funded status provisions of sfas was an increase in assets of million  an increase in liabilities of million and a pretax increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
sfas also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of its fiscal year end  effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the measurement date provision during the year ended december   which had an immaterial impact on beginning retained earnings  accumulated other comprehensive income and pension liabilities 
the net periodic cost of the pension and postretirement plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate of growth for medical costs 
the net periodic pension and postretirement income or expense is recognized in the year incurred 
gains and losses  which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions  are amortized over the average future service period of employees 
our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows in determining the discount rate  we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve rounded to the nearest basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan 
salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the salary increase assumption applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans  as benefits under these plans are not frozen 

table of contents in determining the long term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments  and the utilization of forward looking assumptions 
retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality 
trademarks and other identifiable intangibles trademarks and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives  and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives 
we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows 
as of december   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million  of which we are amortizing the entire balance 
we anticipate that our amortization expense for will be million 
we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
we measure a trademark s fair value using the royalty saved method 
we determine the royalty saved method by evaluating various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
the rates we use to discount cash flows are based on interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
because there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them  the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
during the third quarter of the year ended december   we changed the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing to the first day of the third fiscal quarter 
prior to year ended december   our policy was to perform the test at the end of the second fiscal quarter which coincided with sara lee s policy before the spin off 
the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date was made following the change in our fiscal year end from the saturday closest to june to the saturday closest to december and results in the testing continuing to be performed in the middle of our fiscal year 
in addition  this change in accounting principle better aligns the annual goodwill impairment test with the timing of our annual long range planning cycle 
the change in accounting principle does not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
accordingly  we believe that the change in accounting principle described above is preferable under the circumstances 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined that our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
we rely on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors  and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 

table of contents we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of reporting units 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at its historical cost  and we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the asset s life 
we estimate an asset s life based on historical experience  manufacturers estimates  engineering or appraisal evaluations  our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us  which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life 
our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods 
based upon current levels of depreciation  the average remaining depreciable life of our net property other than land is five years 
we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
we evaluate an asset s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use  we depreciate the asset s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life 
we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for property  workers compensation and other casualty programs 
we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from the estimates  the financial results could be impacted 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill as discussed below under goodwill 
we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles  consulting actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans  and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards fair value measurements the fasb has issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for more information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect that fair value measurements have on earnings 
sfas will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas on our results of operations and financial position 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the provisions of sfas become effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial position 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
the objective of sfas is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a company provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
under sfas r  a company is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  contingent consideration measured at their fair value at the acquisition date 
it further required that research and development assets acquired in a business combination that have no alternative future use to be measured at their acquisition date fair value and then immediately charged to expense  and that acquisition related costs are to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
among other changes  this statement also required that negative goodwill be recognized in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquisition  and any deferred tax benefits resulting from a business combination are recognized in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a company provides in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires a company to clearly identify and present ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the company in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the company s equity 
it also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income  changes in ownership interest be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value  sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
foreign exchange risk we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase some raw materials  pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar 
we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts 
at december   the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  assuming a adverse change in the underlying currency price  was million 
interest rates we are required under the senior secured credit facility and the second lien credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
at december   we have outstanding hedging arrangements whereby we capped the interest rate on million of our floating rate debt at 
we also entered into interest rate swaps tied to the month and month libor rates whereby we fixed the interest rate on an aggregate of million of our floating rate debt at a blended rate of approximately 
approximately of our total debt outstanding at december  is at a fixed or capped rate 
after giving effect to these arrangements  a basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of december  would result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
commodities cotton is the primary raw material we use to manufacture many of our products 
in addition  fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products  such as chemicals  dyestuffs  polyester yarn and foam 
we generally purchase our raw materials at market prices 
in the year ended july   we started to use commodity financial instruments to hedge the price of cotton  for which there is a high correlation between costs and the financial instrument 
we generally do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge other raw material commodity prices 
at december   the potential change in fair value of cotton commodity derivative instruments  assuming a adverse change in the underlying commodity price  was million
