item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as of march   we operated casual dining restaurants featuring on premises breweries under the name granite city food brewery 
using the proceeds from the sale of our securities  debt and equipment financing and cash flow from operations  we intend to finance our working capital needs and expand our restaurant chain into markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
we believe that our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  changes in food and labor costs  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  the skill and experience of our restaurant level management teams and weather conditions 
we expect the timing of new restaurant openings to have a significant impact on restaurant revenue and costs 
we believe we will incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a new restaurant within the two months immediately preceding  and the month of  the opening of such restaurant 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the last tuesday of december to account for our operations 
all references to   and within the following discussion represent fiscal years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
our fiscal year ended december  included restaurant weeks  which is the sum of the actual number of weeks each restaurant operated 
our fiscal year ended december  included restaurant weeks

our restaurant revenue is comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
the sale of retail items typically represents less than one percent of total revenue 
product costs include the costs of food  beverages and retail items 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the salaries and related costs of our dedicated new store opening team  rent expense incurred during the construction period and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  which include management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  market research  professional fees  supplies and corporate rent 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures at the restaurant and corporate levels and amortization of intangibles that do not have indefinite lives 
interest expense represents the cost of interest expense on debt and capital leases net of interest income on invested assets

critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of our financial statements property and equipment the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to years 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the initial term of the related lease  which is generally years 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes 
amortization of assets acquired under capital lease is included in depreciation expense 
we review property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
we base this assessment upon the carrying value versus the fair market value of the asset and whether or not that difference is recoverable 
such assessment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis and includes other relevant facts and circumstances including the physical condition of the asset 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates we have made 
leasing activities we have entered into various leases for our buildings  equipment and for ground leases 
at the inception of a lease  we evaluate it to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease pursuant to sfas no 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the date the lease agreement is signed and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurants sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease which can impact the classification and account for a lease as capital or operating 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  rent expense and interest expense than would be reported if different assumptions were made 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under such provisions  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
under the black scholes option pricing model  we determine the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date 
this requires judgment  including but not limited to judgment concerning the expected volatility of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of prepared food and beverage and select retail items and is recognized at the time of sale 
revenue derived from gift card sales is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  the outstanding balances on such cards are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize gift card breakage amounts based upon historical redemption patterns  which represent the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
we arrive at this amount using certain management judgments and estimates 
such judgments and estimates may produce different amounts of breakage than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenue we generated  and  of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in revenue of for over was primarily the result of the additional restaurant operating weeks related to the four restaurants that opened in fiscal year included restaurant operating weeks while fiscal year included operating weeks 
average weekly revenue decreased from  per week in to  per week in for all the restaurants in operation during the year 
comparable restaurant revenue  which includes restaurants in operation over months  increased from to primarily due to a price increase in late november and a price increase that took effect in october of  offset by a decrease in guest traffic 
we expect that restaurant revenue will vary from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate continued seasonal fluctuations in restaurant revenue due in part to increased outdoor seating and generally favorable weather conditions at many of our locations during the summer months 
due to the honeymoon effect that periodically occurs with the opening of a restaurant  we expect the timing of new restaurant openings to cause fluctuations in restaurant revenue 
additionally  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in consumer preferences may affect our future revenue 
we believe that decreased consumer confidence negatively impacted the restaurant industry as a whole during restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in the increase was largely due to the increase in the cost of dairy  chicken  fish and bottled beer 
in order to offset these increases in commodity costs  we have taken steps to increase our oversight of inventory and kitchen management 
additionally  we have announced our intention of increasing our menu prices in early and will continue to monitor such prices in an effort to address future commodity price increases 
we expect that our food and beverage costs will vary going forward due to numerous variables  including seasonal changes in food and beverage costs  and guest preferences 
we periodically create new menu offerings and introduce new craft brewed beers based upon guest preferences 
although such menu modifications may temporarily result in increased food and beverage cost  we believe we are able to offset such increases with our weekly specials which provide variety and value to our guests 
our varieties of craft brewed beer  which we believe we can produce at lower cost than beers we purchase for resale  also enable us to keep our food and beverage costs low while fulfilling guest requests and building customer loyalty 
we expect food and beverage costs at our newer restaurants to be higher initially due to inefficiencies that are part of the start up process of a new restaurant 
however  as we open additional restaurants  we believe we will experience increased purchasing power company wide  partially offsetting food and beverage cost increases  thereby enabling us to maintain or reduce our food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue 
additionally  as we add new restaurants  we believe our brewing process will allow us to keep our high quality beer products intact while leveraging our fixed production costs  thereby enhancing overall profitability 
labor labor expense consists of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items including partner and management bonuses  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our experience to date has been that staff labor costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
our labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in due primarily to minimum wage increases  turnover and non cash stock based compensation resulting from stock options issued in we expect that labor costs will vary as we add new restaurants 
minimum wage laws  local labor laws and practices  as well as unemployment rates vary from state to state and will affect our labor costs  as will hiring and training expenses at our new units 
we believe that retaining good employees and more experienced staff ensures high quality guest service and may reduce hiring and training costs 
direct restaurant operating operating supplies  repairs and maintenance  utilities  promotions and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct restaurant operating expense  a substantial portion of which is fixed or indirectly variable 
our direct restaurant operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in expense related to in restaurant promotions has increased as well as expense related to the acceptance of credit and debit cards due to increased usage 
expenses related to repair and maintenance and loss on disposal of assets have increased due to certain upgrades primarily at our mature properties 
occupancy our occupancy costs  which include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes  increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was due to higher rent expense  common area maintenance charges and property tax  offset in part by a decrease in property and casualty insurance 
pre opening pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  wages and expenses of our dedicated new store opening teams  rental costs incurred during the construction period and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
pre opening costs  excluding construction period rent  are primarily incurred in the month of  and two months prior to  the restaurant opening 
pre opening costs increased  to  from  in included in such expense was  and  of non cash rental costs incurred during construction periods in and  respectively 
pre opening costs in were made up primarily of costs incurred during construction periods of the seven restaurants we opened between july and february pre opening costs in related primarily to the seven restaurants we opened that year 
general and administrative general and administrative expense includes all salaries and benefits  including non cash stock based compensation  associated with our corporate staff that is responsible for overall restaurant quality  future expansion into new locations  financial controls and reporting  restaurant management recruiting  training at granite city university  excess capacity costs related to our beer production facility  and salaries and expenses of our new store opening team when it is not dedicated to a particular restaurant opening 
other general and administrative expense includes advertising  professional fees  investor relations  office administration  centralized accounting system costs  and travel by our corporate management 
general and administrative expense increased  to  in from  in the primary sources of such increase were expenses related to compensation including recruiting costs  severance costs and stock based compensation  consulting related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  legal and investor relations costs and travel related expense 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing costs and insurance 
non cash stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense was  and  in and  respectively 
despite the foregoing increases in general and administrative expense  the increase in restaurant revenue associated with additional locations caused our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue to in from in as we continue to expand our restaurant chain  we will closely monitor our general and administrative expense while seeking to preserve an infrastructure that remains suitable for our anticipated growth 
we plan to add personnel as needed  specifically district operators  to provide better oversight of operations and we plan to continue to improve our recruiting  training and retention initiatives 
while our general and administrative expense may increase in the near term as we reinforce our current infrastructure  we expect such expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue in the long term due to economies of scale 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  to  in from  in  due principally to the additional depreciation related to new restaurants 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense increased to in from in interest net interest expense consists of interest expense on capital leases and long term debt  net of interest earned from cash on hand 
interest expense increased  to  in from  in the increase was due to increases in capital leases as a result of additional restaurants 
interest income increased  in over that of due to the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in march results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenue we generated  and  of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively

average weekly revenue increased to  per week in from  per week in for all the restaurants in operation during the year 
comparable restaurant revenue  which includes restaurants in operation over months  increased for the increase in comparable restaurant revenue was primarily driven by an increase in guest traffic 
a price increase that took effect at the end of november also contributed to the increase in revenue and comparable restaurant revenue 
restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from in the decrease was due primarily to more experienced staff members generating less waste  as well as lower per unit product prices due to continued higher volume company wide purchasing 
labor our labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from in primarily due to improvement in managing our labor costs along with a favorable trend in our workers compensation insurance costs 
direct restaurant operating our direct operating expense  as a percentage of revenue  decreased during to from for the decrease was attributable to lower use of take out paper and packaging supplies  lower utility costs  and lower repair and maintenance expenses 
occupancy occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  of cash and a  working capital deficit compared to  of cash and a  working capital deficit at december  during the year ended december   we received net cash of  from the issuance of our common stock  of which  was received from the exercise of options and warrants while the remainder represented the net proceeds from the sale of common stock in march  as detailed below 
we obtained proceeds of  pursuant to capital lease agreements and made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations 
of such capital lease payments  approximately million represented a one time payment to retire debt obtained from dhw  as detailed below 
we used  of net cash in operating activities and  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily related to our new restaurant expansion 
during the year ended december   the net cash generated from operations was  we used  to purchase assets for our new restaurants  beer production facility and our existing restaurants 
we obtained proceeds of  from capital leases to fund a portion of the property and equipment for restaurants we opened in we made payments of  on our bank debt and our building and equipment capital leases 
additionally  we received  from the exercise of stock options 
in march  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with accredited investors under which we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we obtained gross proceeds of  paid our placement agents cash commissions aggregating  and paid expenses aggregating  pursuant to the conditions of the stock purchase agreement  we used approximately million of the  net proceeds to retire the entire balance of equipment lease debt we had obtained from dhw pursuant to the master lease agreement we entered into in september the members of dhw are donald a

hey and steven j 
wagenheim 
mr 
wagenheim is our company s president  chief executive officer and one of its directors 
mr 
wagenheim owns a membership interest in dhw and personally guaranteed of dhw s indebtedness to its lenders 
the remaining net proceeds from this placement were used to fund the expansion of our restaurant operations 
we intend to continue expansion in markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
we plan to continue using our model as we open future restaurants  however  where appropriate  we will convert existing restaurants to our granite city concept 
additionally  we intend to explore alternative restaurant designs to reduce the cost of our initial capital investment and we may alter our model to meet various state and local regulatory requirements  including  but not limited to  pollution control requirements  liquor license ordinances and smoking regulations 
we intend to open two additional restaurants in and are in negotiations for these locations in south bend  indiana and indianapolis carmel  indiana 
based upon our existing prototype  we anticipate that pre opening costs and the initial purchase of furniture  fixtures and equipment will require an investment by us of approximately million to million for each new restaurant 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will require an investment by our developer of approximately million to million for the building and approximately million to million for the purchase of the land 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  labor markets and other variables 
pursuant to the terms of some of our lease agreements  our developer receives a construction allowance from the landlord which  in turn  is passed on to us as a reduction in the construction cost of a new restaurant 
landlord contributions received related to restaurants developed in ranged from million to million per location 
as a result  the net capital investment is lower for a restaurant that receives a landlord contribution 
in some instances we may elect to use our own cash for a portion of the building costs resulting in lower minimum lease payments 
to finance certain restaurant openings during and  we entered into a master lease agreement with carlton financial corporation in august and equipment lease commitments and master equipment lease with dhw leasing  llc in september and december during fiscal years and  we also commenced leases for restaurant properties 
details regarding such arrangements appear below under the captions commitments capital leases and commitments operating leases 
we will need to expend significant capital in connection with our expansion plans 
utilizing the december million dhw equipment lease commitment  of which approximately million lease financing remained available to us as of march   as well as cash generated from operations  we believe that we will have sufficient funds to complete our planned restaurant openings into and maintain sufficient working capital for our operations 
if we deviate from our planned openings  or there is a change in our cost of capital  the availability of developer financing or landlord contributions  we may require further funding sooner than anticipated 
we are exploring opportunities to reduce our cash usage per restaurant by utilizing sites that offer lower costs of capital and real estate funding 
if our available sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our expected capital needs  or our needs are greater than anticipated  we will be required to raise additional funds in the future through the incurrence of indebtedness or public or private sales of equity securities 
at this time  we are continuing to pursue debt financing alternatives in order to solidify our expansion plans 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from current operations or if financing is not available to us  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our ability to fund our operations in future periods will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we elect to raise additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the sales may be at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations  covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business  and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs 
commitments capital leases as of december   we had capital lease agreements related to our restaurant properties 
of these leases  one expires in  two in  four in  three in  six in and the remaining four in  all with renewable options for additional periods 
eighteen of these lease agreements originated with our developer 
under ten of the leases  we may be required to pay additional contingent rent based upon restaurant sales 
the land portion of these leases is classified as an operating lease while the building portion of these leases is classified as a capital lease because its present value was greater than of the estimated fair value at the beginning of the lease and or the lease term represents or more of the expected life of the property 
in december  we entered into a land and building lease agreement for our beer production facility 
this ten year lease  which commenced february   allows us to purchase the facility at any time for plus the unamortized construction costs 
because the construction costs will be fully amortized through payment of rent during the base term  if the option is exercised at or after the end of the initial ten year period  the option price will be 
as such  the lease is classified as a capital lease

development agreement in october  we entered into a development agreement with dunham capital management llc dunham for the development of restaurants 
dunham is controlled by donald a 
dunham  jr  who is a member of dhw and an affiliate of granite partners  llc  a beneficial owner approximately one percent of our securities 
the agreement gives dunham the right to develop  construct and lease up to restaurants for us prior to december  as of december   restaurants had been constructed for us under this development agreement 
we are not bound to authorize the construction of restaurants during the term of the development agreement  but generally cannot use another developer to develop or own a restaurant as long as the development agreement is in effect 
we can use another developer if dunham declines to build a particular restaurant  if the agreement is terminated because of a default by dunham  or if our company is sold or merged into another company 
in the case of a merger or sale of our company  the development agreement may be terminated 
as of march   restaurants had been constructed for us under this development agreement 
we intend to explore continuation of our relationship with dunham  use other third party developers and or use our own capital for future expansion 
the development agreement provides for a cooperative process between dunham and our management for the selection of restaurant sites and the development of restaurants on those sites  scheduling for the development and construction of each restaurant once a location is approved  and controls on the costs of development and construction using bidding and guaranteed maximum cost concepts 
the development agreement provides that restaurants will be leased to us on the basis of a triple net lease 
the rental rate of each lease will be calculated using a variable formula which is based on approved and specified costs of development and construction and an indexed interest rate 
the term of each lease is generally years with three to five five year options to renew 
in september and december  we entered into amendments of this development agreement 
under the terms of these amendments  lease rates on all future lease agreements pursuant to the development agreement will be increased by commencing on the fifth anniversary of each lease and on each five year anniversary thereafter 
additionally  the lease rate increases applied to leases which had been entered into prior to the amendments 
dunham also has the right to sell the underlying land and building to third parties or assign these leases 
as of december   dunham had sold four of our restaurant sites to third parties 
the assignment or sale of a lease by dunham has had no material impact on the development agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations under contractual agreements as of december   and the time frame within which payments on such obligations are due 
this table does not include amounts related to contingent rent as such future amounts are not determinable 
in addition  whether we would incur any additional expense on our employment agreements depends upon the existence of a change in control of the company or other unforeseeable events 
therefore  no contingent rent nor severance expense has been included in the following table 
payments due by period contractual obligations total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years fiscal years thereafter long term debt  principal    interest on long term debt    capital lease obligations  including interest  operating lease obligations  including interest  loan guarantee     total obligations    certain amounts do not sum due to rounding 
based on our cash position at december   we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our current obligations 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will become effective for financial statements issued for our company s fiscal year beginning after november   subject to a one year delay for nonfinancial assets 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which will permit the option of choosing to measure certain eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses in earnings  providing sfas is also adopted 
we are currently evaluating the effect that sfas and sfas might have on our future financial position  results of operations and operating cash flows 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations and certain other transactions 
sfas r will apply prospectively to business combinations and certain other transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the start of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and early adoption is prohibited 
we currently do not contemplate any business combinations or other transactions that will be subject to sfas r when it becomes effective 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   and earlier adoption is prohibited 
since we do not now have and do not contemplate acquiring any interests in subsidiaries or variable interest entities with noncontrolling interests  management currently expects that sfas will not have an impact on our future financial position  results of operations and operating cash flows 
seasonality we expect that our sales and earnings will fluctuate based on seasonal patterns 
we anticipate that our highest sales and earnings will occur in the second and third quarters due to the milder climate and availability of outdoor seating during those quarters in our existing and proposed markets 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  supplies and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
in the past  we have been able to minimize the effect of these increases through menu price increases and other strategies 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
changes in interest rate pursuant to the terms of our capital leases and long term debt  we will have balloon payments due over the next two to five years 
if it becomes necessary to refinance such balloon balances  we may not be able to secure financing at the same interest rate 
the effect of a higher interest rate would depend upon the negotiated financing terms 
changes in commodity prices many of the food products we purchase are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
extreme fluctuations in commodity prices and or long term changes could have an adverse affect on us 
although a large national distributor is our primary supplier of food  substantially all of the food and supplies we purchase are available from several sources  which helps to control commodity price risks 
additionally  we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  in response to a food product price increase 
if  however  competitive circumstances limit our menu price flexibility  margins could be negatively impacted 
our company does not enter into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
