overview we are a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services 
the average amount financed by timepayment during was approximately  while leasecomm historically financed contracts averaging approximately  our portfolio consists of point of sale pos authorization systems and other small business equipment leased or rented to small commercial enterprises 
we derive the majority of our revenues from leases originated and held by us  payments on service contracts  rental contracts and fee income 
historically  we funded the majority of our leases and contracts through our revolving credit loans  term loans and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent our subordinated debt program and internally generated funds 
between october and june  an interruption in our financing sources had a significant impact on our ability to originate contracts 
as of september   our then existing credit facility failed to renew and we began paying down the debt  suspending virtually all new contract originations in october until new financing could be obtained or until the credit facility could be paid in full 
in april  we entered into a long term agreement with our lenders which waived certain covenant defaults and required us to repay the credit facility over a month term at an interest rate of prime plus 
we also received a waiver for the covenant violations in our existing securitization agreement and amended the securitization agreement to conform its covenants to the covenants in the senior credit facility 
in june  we secured a one year million line of credit and a million three year subordinated note that allowed us to resume microticket contract originations 
in conjunction with raising new capital  we also established a new wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment corp 
in september  we secured a three year  million  senior secured revolving line of credit from cit commercial services  a unit of cit group 
the cit line of credit replaced the million line of credit obtained in june under more favorable terms and conditions 
in addition  we used the proceeds from the cit line of credit to retire the existing debt with the former bank group 
during the year ended december   we began to actively increase our industry presence with a more focused and targeted sales and marketing effort 
we continue to invest capital to build an infrastructure to support our sales and marketing initiatives  and have brought in experienced sales and marketing management to spearhead the effort 
on july   by mutual agreement between cit and us  we paid off and terminated the cit line of credit without penalty 
on august   we entered into a new three year million line of credit with sovereign bank based on qualified timepayment lease receivables 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at prime or at libor plus and are collateralized by eligible lease contracts and a security interest in all of our other assets 
under the terms of the facility  loans are prime rate loans  unless we elect libor loans 
if a libor loan is not renewed at maturity it automatically coverts to a prime rate loan 
in a typical lease transaction  we originate a lease through our nationwide network of equipment vendors  independent sales organizations and brokers 
upon our approval of a lease application and verification that the lessee has received the equipment and signed the lease  we pay the dealer for the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  we purchase the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments from the dealer 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by us are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  we are scheduled to receive payments sufficient to cover our borrowing costs  the cost of the underlying equipment and provide us with an appropriate profit 
we enhance the profitability of our leases and contracts by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
collection fees are 
table of contents imposed based on our estimate of the costs of collection 
we only impose late fees on the first four months of late payments and are prohibited from imposing compound late fees or from assessing late fees as a percentage of the total outstanding late payments including outstanding late fees 
the loss and damage waiver fees are charged if a customer fails to provide proof of insurance and are reasonably related to the cost of replacing the lost or damaged equipment or product 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides us with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in our portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  critical accounting policies we consider certain of our accounting policies to be the most critical to our financial condition and results of operations in the sense that they involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we have identified our most critical accounting policies as those policies related to revenue recognition  the allowance for credit losses  income taxes and accounting for share based compensation 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  we record the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in our opinion  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  we may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interest is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
at the end of the lease term  the lessee has the option to buy the equipment at the fair market value  return the equipment or continue to rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
if the lessee continues to rent the equipment  we record our investment in the rental contract at its estimated residual value 
rental revenue and depreciation are recognized based on the methodology described below 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees and service fees relating to the leases and contracts are recognized as they are earned 
our investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
our investment in rental contracts is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
rental income from monthly billings is recognized as the customer continues to rent the equipment 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of our investments in service and rental contracts 
allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses on our investment in leases  service contracts and rental contracts at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our portfolio 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  we do not have a formal credit review committee to review individual transactions 
rather  we developed a sophisticated  risk adjusted pricing model and have automated the credit scoring  approval and collection processes 
we believe that with the proper risk adjusted pricing model  we can grant credit to a wide range of applicants provided we have priced appropriately for the associated risk 
as a result of approving a wide range of credits  we experience a relatively high level of delinquency and write offs in our portfolio 
we periodically review the credit scoring and approval process to ensure that the automated system is making appropriate credit decisions 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  we do not evaluate transactions individually for the purpose of developing and determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
contracts in our portfolio are not re graded subsequent to the initial extension of credit and the allowance is not allocated to specific contracts 
rather  we view the 
table of contents contracts as having common characteristics and maintain a general allowance against our entire portfolio utilizing historical collection statistics and an assessment of current credit risk in the portfolio as the basis for the amount 
we have adopted a consistent  systematic procedure for establishing and maintaining an appropriate allowance for credit losses for our microticket transactions 
we estimate the likelihood of credit losses net of recoveries in the portfolio at each reporting period based upon a combination of the lessee s bureau reported credit score at lease inception and the current delinquency status of the account 
in addition to these elements  we also consider other relevant factors including general economic trends  trends in delinquencies and credit losses  static pool analysis of our portfolio  trends in recoveries made on charged off accounts  and other relevant factors which might affect the performance of our portfolio 
this combination of historical experience  credit scores  delinquency levels  trends in credit losses  and the review of current factors provide the basis for our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
we take charge offs against our receivables when such receivables are deemed uncollectible which is generally at days past due where no contact has been made with the lessee for months 
historically  the typical monthly payment under our microticket leases has been small and as a result  our experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
in addition  our income tax calculations involve the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
differences between the basis of assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent management believes recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
share based compensation as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas r share based payments  which requires the measurement of compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r securities and exchange commission  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
share based payments and our prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas accounting for stock based payments 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected option term  volatility of our stock  the risk free interest rate and our dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by us under sfas r 

table of contents results of operations revenues change change in thousands income on financing leases rental income income on service contracts loss and damage waiver fees service fees and other interest income total revenues our lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  we record the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases and contracts  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  or from the year ended december  revenue from leases was million  up million from the previous year and rental income was million  down million from other revenue components contributed million  down million from the previous year 
the decline in service contract revenue accounted for  of the million decrease in other revenue while decreases in service fees and interest income accounted for  and  of the decline respectively 
the decline in rental income is primarily explained by attrition rates in the two sources of rental income 
one source is rental agreements that are originated and cancellable on a monthly basis 
the other is the rental income that is recognized at the end of the lease term when a lessee chooses to keep the equipment and rents it on a monthly basis 
since we resumed funding in  we have not originated any new rental contracts  and few lease contracts have been eligible to convert to rental arrangements since they have not reached the end of term 
in addition  we have not funded any new service contracts since we resumed funding in  therefore this segment of revenue is expected to continue to decline 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  the decline in revenue included decreases of million or in rental income  million or in income on service contracts and  or in loss and damage waiver fees 
income on financing leases also declined by  or 
the decrease in income on financing leases improved significantly from the decrease in as a result of our recent increase in originations 
the overall decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the size of our portfolio of rental and service contracts that resulted from the lack of financing between october and june offsetting these decreases was a  increase in interest income on our cash and cash equivalents

the expense reductions resulted from the decrease in the overall volume of our portfolio  an improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio  the settlement of outstanding litigation and our cost control efforts 
sg a expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in personnel related expenses of approximately million  as management reduced headcount from to  and decreases of million in collection expenses and million in professional fees

provision for credit losses change change dollars in thousands provision for credit losses as a percent of revenue we maintain an allowance for credit losses on our investment in leases  service contracts and rental contracts at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our portfolio 
our provision for credit loss increased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net charge offs decreased million to million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the provision was based on providing a general allowance against leases funded during the year and our analysis of actual and expected losses in our portfolio as a whole 
the increase in the allowance reflects the growth in lease receivables associated with new lease originations 
our provision for credit losses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   while net charge offs decreased to million 
the provision was based on providing a general allowance against leases funded during the year and our analysis of actual and expected losses in our portfolio as a whole 
depreciation and amortization change change dollars in thousands depreciation fixed assets depreciation rental equipment amortization service contracts total depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on fixed assets and rental equipment  and the amortization of service contracts 
fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over their expected useful lives 
certain rental contracts are originated as a result of the renewal provisions of our lease agreements where at the end of the lease term  the customer may elect to continue to rent the leased equipment on a month to month basis 
the rental equipment is recorded at its residual value and depreciated over a term of months 
this term represents the estimated life of a previously leased piece of equipment and is based upon our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value is expensed 
we also offer a financial product where the customer may sign a rental agreement  which allows the customer  assuming the contract is current and no event of default exists  to terminate the contract at any time by returning the equipment and providing us with days notice 
these assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over an estimated life of months 
this term is based upon our historical experience 
in the event that the contract terminates prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value is expensed 

table of contents service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated life of months 
in a typical service contract acquisition  a homeowner will purchase a home security system and simultaneously sign a contract with the security dealer for monthly monitoring of the system 
the security dealer will then sell the rights to that monthly payment to us 
we perform all of the processing  billing  collection and administrative work on the service contract 
the estimated life of months for service contracts is based upon the expected life of such contracts in the security monitoring industry and our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month term  the remaining net book value is expensed 
depreciation expense on rentals decreased by million  or  and amortization of service contracts decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization is expected to decline in as the carrying value of our rental equipment and service contracts decreased from  at december  to  at december  depreciation on property and equipment increased by  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  depreciation expense on rentals decreased by million  or and amortization of service contracts decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense is expected to continue to decline in as the carrying value of our rental equipment and service contracts decreased from million at december  to  at december  depreciation on property and equipment decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  interest expense change change dollars in thousands interest as a percent of revenue we pay interest on borrowings under our line of credit

we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent we believe recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is unnecessary 
the provision benefit for income taxes increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the million increase in income before income taxes

the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in the rate was the before tax profits  offset in part by an increase in the nondeductible expenses 
our through tax years were audited by the internal revenue service 
as part of the audit  the internal revenue service agent had proposed several adjustments to our federal income tax returns that would have required us to pay the irs an amount between and million 
such payments would have been offset by an adjustment to our deferred tax asset as the amount would likely have been recoverable in future periods 
we filed a formal protest under the appeals process challenging these adjustments and reached a final settlement in december which required us to pay  in additional taxes and  in interest 
other operating data dealer fundings were million during the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to the year ended december  this increase is a result of our continuing effort to increase originations through business development efforts that include increasing the size of our vendor base and sourcing a larger number of applications from those vendors

exposure to credit losses the amounts in the table below represent the balance of delinquent receivables on an exposure basis for all leases  rental contracts and service contracts in our portfolio as of december   and an exposure basis aging classifies the entire receivable based on the invoice that is the most delinquent 
for example  in the case of a rental or service contract  if a receivable is days past due  all amounts billed and unpaid are placed in the over days past due category 
in the case of lease receivables  where the minimum contractual obligation of the lessee is booked as a receivable at the inception of the lease  if a receivable is days past due  the entire receivable  
table of contents including all amounts billed and unpaid as well as the minimum contractual obligation yet to be billed  will be placed in the over days past due category 
the recent improvement in our aging exposure is due to the increase in lease originations in and an overall improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio 
december  december  december  dollars in thousands current days past due days past due over days past due receivables due in installments liquidity and capital resources general our lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund lease originations 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities  on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt  free cash flow and our initial public offering completed in february we will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand our funding of leases and contracts  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
in the near term  we expect to finance our business utilizing the cash on hand and our line of credit which matures in august additionally  our uses of cash include the payment of interest and principal on borrowings  selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
we generated cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  investing activities primarily relate to the origination of leases with investments in lease contracts  direct costs  property  and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  financing activities includes borrowings from and repayments on our various financing sources 
we repaid million during  million during  and million during in addition  we paid dividends of million in  million in and million in we believe that cash flows from our existing portfolio  cash on hand  available borrowings on the existing credit facility  and additional financing as required will be sufficient to support our operations and lease origination activity in the near term 
borrowings we utilize our line of credit to fund the origination and acquisition of leases 
borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit consist of the following december  december  maximum maximum amounts interest unused facility amounts interest unused facility outstanding rate capacity amount outstanding rate capacity amount dollars in revolving credit facility the unused capacity is subject to limitations based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula 
table of contents on august   we entered into a new three year million line of credit with sovereign bank based on qualified lease receivables 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at prime or at libor plus and are collateralized by eligible lease contracts and a security interest in all of our other assets 
as of december  the qualified lease receivables eligible under the borrowing base exceeded the million line of credit 
the line of credit has financial covenants that we must comply with to obtain funding and avoid an event of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the line of credit 
at december  all of our loans were prime rate loans 
the prime rate at december  was prior to entering into the sovereign facility  we had a three year senior secured revolving line of credit with cit commercial services  a unit of cit group cit  where we could borrow a maximum of million based upon qualified lease receivables 
outstanding borrowings bore interest at prime plus for prime rate loans or at the day london interbank offered rate libor plus for libor loans 
as of december   based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula  we had million in excess availability on the cit line of credit 
on july   by mutual agreement between cit and us  we paid off and terminated the cit line of credit without penalty  and cit released its security interests and liens 
prior to obtaining the million cit line of credit in september  we had borrowings outstanding under a million senior credit facility with a group of financial institutions  which failed to renew in september while cash flows from our portfolio were sufficient to repay borrowings under the million senior credit facility  we were forced to suspend virtually all contract originations until a new source of liquidity was obtained 
as of december   the loan under the million senior credit facility had been fully repaid 
we have periodically in the past financed our lease and service contracts through securitizations using special purpose entities 
when we use this financing alternative  the assets of these special purpose entities were not available to pay our other creditors 
however  the special purpose entities were included in our consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  such assets and the related liabilities remain on our balance sheet and do not receive gain on sale treatment 
the amounts borrowed under our securitization agreements were fully repaid as of december  and the special purpose entities associated with these agreements were subsequently dissolved 
financial covenants our sovereign line of credit  like our prior facilities  has financial covenants that must be complied with in order to obtain funding through the facility and to avoid an event of default 
as of december   we believe that we were in compliance with all covenants in our borrowing relationships 
contractual obligations and lease commitments contractual obligations we have entered into various agreements  such as debt and operating lease agreements that require future payments 
as of december  we had borrowed million against our lines of credit and had repaid million 
the million of outstanding borrowings as of december  will be repaid by the daily application of timepayment receipts to our outstanding balance 
our future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are  annually for the years through lease commitments we accept lease applications on a daily basis and have a pipeline of applications that have been approved  where a lease has not been originated 
our commitment to lend does not become binding until all of the steps in the lease origination process have been completed  including but not limited to the receipt of a complete and accurate lease document  all required supporting information and successful verification with the lessee 
since we fund on the same day a lease is successfully verified  we have no firm outstanding commitments to lend 

table of contents market risk and financial instruments the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of operations  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
the implicit yield on all of our leases and contracts is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases and contracts having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination 
when we originate or acquire leases or contracts  we base our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the implicit yield on each lease or contract and the effective interest rate we expect to incur in financing such lease or contract through our credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease or contract could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
given the relatively short average life of our leases and contracts  our goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations which limits our interest rate risk 
as of december   we have repaid all of our fixed rate debt and have million of outstanding variable interest rate obligations under our sovereign line of credit 
our sovereign line of credit bears interest at rates which fluctuate with changes in the prime rate or the libor  therefore  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on our interest expense would be immaterial 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
the primary objectives of the investment guidelines are to preserve capital  maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs  and to maximize return 
we minimize investment risk by limiting the amount invested in any single security and by focusing on conservative investment choices with short terms and high credit quality standards 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or invest for speculative trading purposes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value 
this statement establishes a fair value hierarchy about the assumptions used to measure fair value and clarifies assumptions about risk and the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset 
statement is effective as of the beginning of fiscal yeas that begin after november  we believe the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february fasb issued sfas  including and amendment of fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas permits fair value to be used for both the initial and subsequent measurements on a contract by contract election  with changes in fair value to be recognized in earning as those changes occur 
sfas also revises provisions of sfas that apply to available for sale and trading securities 
statement is effective as of the beginning of fiscal yeas that begin after november  we believe the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement addresses consolidation rules for noncontrolling interests 
the objective is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary
