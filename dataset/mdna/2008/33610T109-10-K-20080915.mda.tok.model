financial condition general 
assets at june  totaled billion compared with billion at june   an increase of million or 
exclusive of the increase of million from the acquisitions of hbls bank and oc financial  the company s assets declined million or 
we anticipate that future growth will come from a combination of increasing market share in existing markets  the addition of new retail branches  the conversion of loan production offices to business financial centers and acquisitions 
growth by acquisition will be subject to the availability and pricing of appropriate acquisition partners 

table of contents securities available for sale 
securities available for sale decreased million during fiscal the million decrease was composed of million of securities acquired in connection with the hbls bank and oc financial acquisitions  sales of million  maturities of million  purchases of million  million in impairment charges and million in other activity decrease in market value 
see the noninterest income section of the comparison of results of operations for the years ended june  and  for further discussion of the impairment charges 
significant reductions in securities are not likely as the company strives to maintain a reasonable level of securities to provide adequate liquidity and in order to have securities available to pledge to secure public funds and other types of transactions 
fluctuations in the market value of securities held by the company relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and management believes  at this time  that all declines in market value in the securities portfolio are temporary 
loans held for sale 
the company engages in mortgage banking as part of an overall strategy to deliver loan products to customers 
as a result  the company sells most fixed rate residential loan originations and a portion of its adjustable rate residential loan originations 
during fiscal  the company originated billion in one to four family residential loans and sold billion compared to originations of billion and sales of billion in fiscal the company was able to maintain the level of sales activity during fiscal at a similar level to fiscal due to the addition of residential loan production offices in ohio  indiana and north carolina 
loans held for sale totaled million at june   a decrease of million or from million at june  the decrease in loans held for sale was due to the higher volume of loans sold and lower volume of mortgage originations during the fourth fiscal quarter of compared to the same period in loans 
total loans increased million or to billion at june   from billion at june  this increase was composed of million of loans acquired from hbls bank and oc financial and a net increase of million in loans retained in the portfolio 
the internal growth of million represented organic growth of 
the internal growth during the year was due to an increase of million or in commercial loans  partially offset by a decrease of million or in mortgage and construction loans and a decrease of million or in consumer loans 
the company s growth in commercial loans during fiscal brought more diversity and higher yields to the loan portfolio 
at june  the portfolio was mortgage and residential construction loans  commercial loans and consumer loans compared with mortgage and construction loans  commercial loans and consumer loans as of june  management anticipates that internal growth during fiscal will result in an increase in commercial loans relative to mortgage and construction loans 
nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets consist of loans past due greater than days  nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and repossessed assets 
there were million of loans past due over days and still accruing interest as of june  and no loans past due over days and still accruing interest as of june  nonperforming assets totaled million or of total assets at june   compared with million or of total assets at june  at june   nonperforming assets consisted of million in nonperforming loans and million in real estate owned 
at june   nonperforming assets consisted of million in nonperforming loans and million of real estate owned 
the increase in nonperforming assets was due to a million increase in nonperforming loans and a million increase in real estate owned 
the company works with borrowers to avoid foreclosure if at all possible and if it becomes inevitable that a borrower will not be able to retain ownership of their property  the company often seeks a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to gain control of the property earlier in the recovery process 
as a result  real estate owned grew million 
the increase in nonperforming loans was composed of million of mortgage and construction loans  million of commercial loans and million of consumer loans 
the increase in nonperforming mortgage and construction loans and consumer loans was related to a decline in the local economy  particularly in the automotive industry 
this is consistent with both midwest and national trends 
of the total nonperforming loans at june   were secured by real estate 
real estate loans are generally well secured and if these loans do default  the majority of the loan balance is recovered by liquidating the real estate 
as of june   the loan portfolio contained million of home builder and land development loans 
historically  loans in this category have the highest delinquency rate 
of these loans  million were past due days or more and million were nonperforming loans 

table of contents at june   the company held million in real estate owned which was held for investment purposes 
the company considers these properties to be performing assets as they are income producing and therefore are not included in any nonperforming asset ratios 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
each quarter management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors 
loans are reviewed individually  or in the case of small homogeneous loans  in the aggregate 
this review includes historical data  the ability of the borrower to meet the terms of the loan  an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan  various collection strategies and other factors relevant to the loan or loans 
external factors considered include but are not limited to economic conditions  current interest rates  trends in the borrower s industry and the market for various types of collateral 
in addition  overall information about the loan portfolio or segments of the portfolio is considered  including industry concentrations  delinquency statistics and workout experience based on factors such as historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions 
as a result  determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses involves not only evaluating the current financial situation of individual borrowers or groups of borrowers but also current predictions about future cash flows that could change before an actual loss is determined 
based on variables involved and the fact that management must make judgments about outcomes that are uncertain  the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy 
in addition to the analysis and procedures just described  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent review of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the company uses the results of this review to help determine the effectiveness of the existing policies and procedures  and to provide an independent assessment of the allowance for loan losses allocated to these types of loans 
the allowance for loan losses was million at june   up million from million at june  net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal net charge offs as a percent of average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal over time  the mix and composition of portfolio loans and nonperforming loans changes 
when the company sets the allowance for loan losses  it is dependent on a detailed analysis of different ratios which may not move in the same direction 
as a result  though the ratio of allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans at june  decreased from the prior year  the ratio of allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans at june  increased from the prior year 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans for the company was at june  compared with at june  the allowance for loan losses was increased to a level deemed adequate by management  after review  to cover the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at june  the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was at june   up from at june  deposits 
total deposits were billion at june   an increase of million  compared with billion at june  the increase was comprised of increases of million acquired with hbls bank and oc bank  million in retail deposits and million in brokered deposits 
the million increase in retail deposits represented growth of during the fiscal year 
the largest deposit category was certificates of deposit  which represented of deposits at june  compared with as of june  the million increase in certificates of deposit during the fiscal year was comprised of increases of million acquired with hbls bank and oc bank  million in retail certificates of deposit and million in brokered deposits 
retail certificates of deposit grew during the fiscal year 
at june   the company had million in brokered deposits with original maturities ranging from one to sixty months 
the company considers brokered deposits to be an element of a diversified funding strategy and an alternative to borrowings 
management regularly compares rates to determine the most economical source of funding 
the company anticipates that it will continue to consider brokered funds as a funding alternative in the future and as a source of short term liquidity  but not as the primary source of funding to support growth 
short term borrowings and long term debt 
short term borrowings decreased million to million at june   compared with million at june  the decrease in short term borrowings was comprised of a net decrease of million in short term borrowings at the federal home loan bank partially offset 
table of contents by million acquired with oc bank 
long term debt increased million to million at june  compared with million at june  the increase in long term debt was comprised of million acquired with the hbls bank and oc financial acquisitions and new borrowings of million  partially offset by million in repayments of long term debt and million in reclassifications to short term borrowings 
during fiscal  the company borrowed million in long term fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank with original maturities ranging from to months at rates ranging from to with a weighted average rate of 
included in long term debt throughout the year were million of junior subordinated debentures 
the company uses short term borrowings and long term debt as part of its liquidity management  cash flow  and asset liability management and considers them to be part of a diversified funding strategy 
short term borrowings and long term debt are alternatives to raising cash through deposit growth and are used when they offer a favorable alternative to deposits in terms of rate  maturity or volume 
capital resources 
total shareholders equity decreased million to million at june   compared with million at june  this decrease was primarily composed of million for the repurchase of the company s common stock and million of cash dividends  partially offset by million in comprehensive income  million acquired with oc financial and million for stock issued in connection with employee and director benefit plans 
the company s board of directors authorized separate common stock repurchase programs in march and august for the combined repurchase of  shares in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions through march during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
the board authorizations to purchase treasury stock have expired and were not renewed 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
stock repurchase programs are a component of the company s strategy to invest excess capital after consideration of market and economic factors  the effect on shareholder dilution  adequacy of capital  effect on liquidity and an assessment of alternative investment returns 
shares repurchased by the company may be used to meet the company s requirements for common shares under its dividend reinvestment plan  stock option or other stock based plans and for general corporate purposes such as expansion and acquisitions or future capital requirements 
there were no shares repurchased after march and the board authorizations to purchase treasury stock have expired 
the company s common stock dividend policy reflects its earnings outlook  desired payout ratios  the need to maintain adequate capital levels and alternative investment opportunities 
beginning in the second fiscal quarter of  the company increased the quarterly dividend to per share compared with per share in the annual dividend increased to in from in at its regular meeting held on july   the board of directors declared a per share cash dividend of  a reduction compared to the previous three quarters 
the board s decision to reduce the quarterly cash dividend will preserve existing capital available to support future growth or to be retained in first place 
office of thrift supervision ots regulations require savings institutions to maintain certain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
additionally  the regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
generally  an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a core tier capital ratio of at least based on adjusted total assets  a core tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at june   the bank s capital levels exceeded the levels required to be well capitalized 
see the liquidity section of this report for a discussion of dividends as a source of funding for the company and dividend restrictions imposed on the bank by the ots 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations 
the company uses a variety of funding sources to finance its earning assets and other activities 
these contractual obligations have various terms and maturities that may require the outlay of cash in the future 
the company also enters into contracts such as lease obligations or purchase obligations that commit the company to make future payments for the acquisition of goods or services needed for the normal conduct of its business 
the following table summarizes those obligations as of june  by type and by payment date 
the amounts represent the amounts contractually due and do not include any interest  premiums  discounts or other

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into arrangements that are not included in the statements of financial position 
they include commitments to make loans  commitments to sell loans  guarantees under letters of credit  interests in securities or derivatives used to hedge the value of loans held for sale and the use of wholly owned unconsolidated special purpose entities that act as trusts to facilitate the sale of debt securities to the public 
as a lending institution  the company makes commitments to lend money before loans are disbursed in order to serve the needs of borrowers 
at june   the company had commitments to make loans totaling million and these loan commitments are similar in form and terms to loans previously originated by the company 
they are underwritten using the same policies and criteria the company uses to underwrite loans 
therefore  these commitments do not present credit risks that are different from the credit risks in the existing loan portfolio 
the company does have interest rate risk on loan commitments and loans held for sale between the time a rate commitment is made to the borrower and the time the company contracts for the sale of the loan 
this risk is minimized by issuing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities to offset this interest rate risk 
at june   the company had million in mortgage loan commitments that are in the form of obligations to sell mortgage backed securities of like maturity and coupon to the loan commitments 
in addition  at june   the company had a funding obligation represented by million in unused lines and letters of credit and million in construction loan funds approved that the borrower has not yet requested be advanced 
the company issues standby letters of credit for commercial customers to third parties to guarantee the performance of customers to those third parties 
if the customer fails to perform  the company performs in its place and treats the funds advanced as an interest bearing loan 
these letters of credit are underwritten using the same policies and criteria as commercial loans 
therefore  these standby letters of credit represent the same risk to the company as a loan to that commercial loan customer would 
at june   the company had million in standby letters of credit outstanding with an average remaining term of months 
while no liability has been recorded for the nominal amount of this obligation  the fair value of this obligation has been recorded in the form of unearned fees 
in december  the company formed two affiliated trusts that issued million of guaranteed capital trust securities 
in september the company formed an additional affiliated trust that issued an additional million of guaranteed capital trust certificates 
these affiliates used the equity capital from the company and the proceeds of the guaranteed capital trust securities to purchase junior subordinated deferrable interest 
table of contents debentures from the company 
the affiliates have no other operations 
based on the structure  nature and purpose of these affiliated trusts  the company has accounted for them using the equity method  and therefore  they have not been included in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has guaranteed the securities issued by the affiliated trusts  however  this guarantee is recorded as a liability of the company in the form of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
for additional information on contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements  see the discussion of commitments  contingencies and guarantees in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and general 
for the year ended june   the company recorded net income of million  a decrease of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share for the year ended june  were  a decrease of compared to for the year ended june  the current year was negatively impacted by provision for loan losses  impairment of securities  real estate owned expense and merger costs associated with the acquisitions of hbls bank and oc financial and the prior year was negatively impacted by merger costs associated with the purchase of retail banking offices from citizens 
for fiscal  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and  respectively  compared to and for fiscal net interest income  loan servicing income  net gains on sales of loans  loan growth and deposit growth are all significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
a review of activity in interest rates over the past two years is helpful in understanding changes in volumes and the levels of certain income statement categories 
the chart below indicates the quarterly change in long term and short term interest rates represented by changes in the us year treasury bond rate  the target federal funds rate and the difference between the two rates 
us year target date treasury bond rate federal funds rate difference while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have declined basis points over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  declined basis points during the same period 
as a result  the yield curve  which had an inverted slope at june   and remained inverted through fiscal  changed to a positive sloped yield curve during fiscal net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statement of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june   totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the yield on loans decreased as loans originated in prior years were paid off and were replaced by loans with lower current market rates 
in addition  the mix of loans in the portfolio changed to include a greater percentage of 
table of contents commercial loans  which carry yields based on a variable rate index prime rate that decreased during fiscal interest income on securities decreased million and totaled million for the year ended june   compared with million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income on securities was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield  partially offset by a million increase in the average balance of securities 
interest expense for the year ended june   was million  an increase of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits increased million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  due to an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average cost of deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june   compared with billion for the year ended june  the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits was the purchase of retail banking offices with deposit balances of million from citizens in april  the hbls bank acquisition in october which included million in deposits and an increase of million in retail deposits during fiscal the average cost of deposits decreased basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
that decrease was due to the decrease in short term interest rates which impacted both the cost of certificates of deposit and nonmaturity deposit accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings decreased million to million from million for the prior year due to a decrease in average short term borrowings and lower average short term interest rates during fiscal than in fiscal the million reduction of average short term borrowings from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the million in cash received from the citizens acquisition in april that was used to reduce short term borrowings and the additional long term debt incurred to lock in historically low interest rates 
interest expense on long term borrowings increased million and was million for the year ended june   up from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of long term borrowings  partially offset by lower average long term interest rates during fiscal than in fiscal the cost of long term borrowings includes the amortization of the losses from the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal scheduled interest rate swap amortization for fiscal is million 
for additional information on borrowings and interest rate swaps  see short term borrowings and long term debt in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and interest rate swaps in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june  totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was driven by loan growth  the citizens acquisition near the end of fiscal and the hbls bank acquisition in october both asset yields and liability costs decreased during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at lower interest rates 
the net result was a four basis point decrease in the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal both spread and net interest margin decreased due to the average yield on interest earnings assets decreasing more than the average cost on interest bearing liabilities and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increasing more than the average balance of interest earning assets during fiscal

the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in fully tax equivalent interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the increase or decrease related to changes in balances and or changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate and ii changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume

the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which represents an increase of million from million for fiscal net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal net charge offs as a percent of average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal nonperforming loans increased million or to million at june   compared with million at june  the allowance for loan losses was increased to a level deemed adequate by management  after review  to cover the estimated probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at june  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans increased to at june   from a year earlier 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased to million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a charge for impairment of securities  and decreases in loan servicing income and other income nonbank subsidiaries  partially offset by increases in service charges and fees on deposit accounts  mortgage banking gains and gain on sale of loan servicing rights 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united state of america require a company to make a determination whether impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
among other determining factors  other than temporary impairment occurs when the market value of a security falls significantly below amortized cost and there is a low probability of the security recovering its loss in the near term 
all of the securities currently on the books of the company are classified as available for sale 
therefore  all securities are recorded in the statement of condition at market value 
this is accomplished by a credit or charge to other comprehensive income  and those market value changes are not reflected in the income statement 
if securities are impaired and the 
table of contents impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the securities are written down by reversing the existing charge to other comprehensive income and recording a charge to the income statement 
for the year ended june   other than temporary impairment of securities was million compared to none in the prior year 
the impairment of securities was composed of a million charge related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  a million charge related to two mutual fund securities and a million charge related to equity securities 
recent capital restructuring at fannie mae and freddie mac and developments in the residential mortgage business have resulted in impairment of these securities 
due to the uncertainty of future market conditions and how they might impact the financial performance of fannie mae and freddie mac  management was unable to determine when or if this impairment will be reversed in the foreseeable future 
at june   the company owned  shares of series f and  shares of series g of fannie mae preferred stock with a value of million 
during fiscal  the company sold all of the freddie mac preferred stock that it previously owned 
the two mutual funds were primarily invested in agency backed and privately issued mortgage securities that did not have any significant exposure to subprime mortgages 
changes in the interest rate environment and the market for mortgage backed securities along with downgrades of the ratings of individual mortgage backed securities within these funds has led management to conclude that these securities are other than temporarily impaired 
during fiscal  the company sold one of the mutual funds and the remaining fund has a current value of million at june  the equity securities that were other than temporarily impaired had a value of at june  the million impairment charge did not have any effect on total capital or the net asset value of the securities as they had already been written down to their market value as available for sale securities with the corresponding charge recorded in other comprehensive income 
loan servicing income decreased million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
interest rates were at lower levels two years ago on june  during the past three years  both short term and long term interest rates have varied significantly and have not moved in tandem resulting in significant shifts in the shape and slope of the yield curve 
the level and variability in interest rates over that period has resulted in significant variations in loan servicing income  including changes in the level of impairment of msrs 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs has impacted loan servicing income over the past two years 
year ended june  dollars in thousands loan servicing income loan servicing revenue net of amortization change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss loan servicing income decreased due primarily to the sale of of the loan servicing portfolio in september  the increase in impairment was due to long term interest rates declining during fiscal compared with long term interest rates rising during fiscal at june   there was million of allowance for impairment of msrs 
other income nonbank subsidiaries decreased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decrease in other income nonbank subsidiaries was due primarily to decreases in investment and real estate commissions related to the economic slowdown in the company s market area 

table of contents service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in service charges and fees on deposit accounts was due primarily to the increase in volume of accounts from the increase in accounts from the citizens acquisition in april  and to a lesser extent the acquisition of hbls bank in october  mortgage banking gains increased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gains in fiscal averaged basis points on billion in sales compared with basis points on billion of loan sales in fiscal the increase in mortgage banking gains was due to increases of million due to the january  adoption of staff accounting bulletin issued by the securities and exchange commission and million due to increases in the basis point spread and volume of loans sold 
the level of loan originations  sales and gains on the sale of loans are all results that tend to vary inversely with interest rates 
loan activity tends to increase as interest rates decrease and loan activity tends to decrease as interest rates increase 
in conjunction with stable residential mortgage interest rates during fiscal  the company was able to maintain mortgage banking activity levels by selectively adding experienced  successful loan officers and by concentrating on servicing customers purchasing homes over customers seeking to refinance their existing homes 
over the past several years  the volume and dollar value of loan servicing rights has been growing more rapidly than total assets on a percentage basis 
as a result  the company s exposure to volatility in mortgage banking revenue has also increased 
in order to reduce exposure to volatility due to rapid payoffs or impairment  the company sold loan servicing rights with a cost basis of million  approximately of its loan servicing rights portfolio  during september gain on the sale of these loan servicing rights was million in fiscal compared with no gain in the prior year 
historically the company has sold loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
management plans to consider additional sales of msrs in the future depending on the size of the servicing asset relative to total assets and based on the current market for the sale of msrs 
as of june  the company was selling approximately of loans with servicing released compared with less than in prior years 
as a result  the company anticipates that the msr asset will grow significantly slower in fiscal than in prior years 
net gain on sale of securities was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal securities may be sold to generate changes in liquidity  to impact interest rate risk  to maximize total returns on securities or to minimize losses on securities in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate that gains or losses on the sale of securities are currently or will be a major component of net income 
however  the purchase and sale of securities do play a significant part in managing the overall liquidity  credit and interest rate risk of the company 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
annualized noninterest expense as a percent of average assets was for fiscal compared with for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense was the operating expense for the increases in retail branch locations and loan production offices and the increase in real estate owned expense  partially offset by a decrease in state and local taxes 
salaries and employee benefits increased or million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal for the year ended june   occupancy and equipment increased million to million and merger  integration and restructuring expense increased million to million 
the increases in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy and equipment were related to the increases in retail branch locations and loan production offices 
at march   the company had branch locations 
in april  seven branches were acquired from citizens 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the hbls bank was acquired and a de novo branch was opened 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  oc financial was acquired bringing the total number of retail branches to or a increase from march  real estate owned expense increased million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in real estate owned expense was due primarily to the volume of properties added to real estate owned over the past fiscal year 
state and local tax expense decreased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the current fiscal year was million  a decrease of million from the prior year expense of million 
the decrease in the income tax expense was due to the 
table of contents decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the overall effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in pretax income while nontaxable income from municipal securities and insurance contracts remained relatively constant 
comparison of results of operations for years ended june  and general 
for the year ended june   the company recorded net income of million  an increase of or million  from net income of million for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share for the year ended june  were  a decrease of compared to for the year ended june  diluted earnings per share decreased while net income increased because first place increased its common shares outstanding by approximately million shares as part of the consideration paid to acquire northern 
the current year was negatively impacted by merger costs associated with the purchase of retail banking offices from citizens and the prior year was negatively impacted by merger costs associated with the acquisition of northern 
for fiscal  returns on average equity roe and average assets roa were and  respectively  compared to and for fiscal net interest income  loan servicing income  net gains on sales of loans  loan growth and deposit growth are all significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
a review of activity in interest rates over the past two years is helpful in understanding changes in volumes and the levels of certain income statement categories 
the chart below indicates the quarterly change in long term and short term interest rates represented by changes in the us year treasury bond rate  the target federal funds rate and the difference between the two rates which is an indicator of the steepness of the interest rate curve 
us year target date treasury bond rate federal funds rate difference while long term rates  represented by the year us treasury rate  have risen basis points over the past two years  short term rates  as represented by the targeted federal funds rate  rose somewhat faster increasing basis points during the same period 
as a result  the yield curve  which had a positive slope at june   became progressively flatter during fiscal and remained inverted throughout fiscal net interest income 
the table in the section titled average balances  interest rates and yields provides important information on factors impacting net interest income and should be read in conjunction with this discussion of net interest income 
interest income and the resulting asset yields in the following table are stated on a fully tax equivalent basis 
therefore  they will vary slightly from interest income in the consolidated statement of income included in the consolidated financial statements 
interest income for the year ended june   totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended june  interest income on loans totaled million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of loans supplemented by an increase in the average yield on loans of to for fiscal compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the yield on loans increased as loans originated in prior years were paid off and were replaced by loans with higher current market rates 
in addition  the mix of loans in the portfolio changed to include a greater percentage of commercial loans  which carry higher yields  and a smaller percentage of mortgage and construction loans 
interest income on securities increased million and totaled million for the year ended june   compared with million for the prior 
table of contents year 
the increase in interest income on securities was due to a basis point increase in the average yield  partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of securities 
interest expense for the year ended june   was million  an increase of million from million for the prior year ended june  interest expense on deposits increased by million to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  due in part to an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances and in part to an increase in the average cost of deposits 
average interest bearing deposit balances increased million to billion for the year ended june   compared with billion for the year ended june  the primary reason for the increase in average interest bearing deposits was the northern acquisition in june the average cost of deposits increased basis points to for fiscal compared with for the previous year 
that increase was due to the increase in short term interest rates which impacted both the cost of certificates of deposit and nonmaturity deposit accounts 
interest expense on short term borrowings increased million to million from million for the prior year due to experiencing higher short term rates during fiscal than in fiscal the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower average balances 
the million reduction of average short term borrowings from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the million in cash received from the citizens acquisition that was used to reduce short term borrowings 
interest expense on long term borrowings increased million and was million for the year ended june   up from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of long term borrowings while the average cost of long term borrowings remained constant 
the cost of long term borrowings includes the amortization of the losses from the termination of interest rate swaps in august those losses are being amortized over the original term of the swaps through interest rate swap amortization expense was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal scheduled interest rate swap amortization for fiscal is million 
additional information can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june   totaled million versus million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest earning assets which was driven by loan growth and the northern acquisition near the end of fiscal both asset yields and liability costs increased during fiscal as older loans and certificates of deposits matured or were paid off and were replaced by new instruments at higher interest rates 
the net result was a basis point decrease in the interest rate spread 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to for fiscal compared with for fiscal both spread and net interest margin decreased due to the inversion of the yield curve during fiscal as the yield curve becomes flatter and eventually inverted  there is less opportunity to increase net interest income by taking on interest rate risk as the differential between short term and long term interest rates decreases 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  which was an increase of million from million for fiscal net charge offs during fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal net charge offs as a percent of average loans increased to for fiscal compared with for fiscal nonperforming loans increased million or to million at june   compared with million at june  the increase in the provision for loan losses in fiscal compared with fiscal was consistent with the increases in net charge offs and nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans increased to at june   from a year earlier 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased to million for the year ended june   from million for the prior year ended june  the increase was due primarily to increases in service charges and fees on deposit accounts  net gains on sale of securities  insurance commission income and other income nonbank subsidiaries  partially offset by a decrease in gain on sale of loan servicing rights 
service charges and fees on deposit accounts increased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the increase in service charges and fees on deposit accounts was due primarily to the increase in volume of accounts from the acquisition of northern and to a lesser extent from the increase in accounts from the citizens acquisition 
net gain on sale of securities was million for fiscal contrasted with losses of million for fiscal the majority of the net gain was due to the sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal of shares of stock which 
table of contents were issued to the company upon the initial public offering of a credit card servicer in may  during fiscal  management made a strategic decision to sell million of low yielding securities at a loss in order to reinvest in higher yielding securities to take advantage of yields in the current market that were higher than they had been for the previous two years 
securities may be sold to generate changes in liquidity  to impact interest rate risk  to maximize total returns on securities or to minimize losses on securities in anticipation of changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate that gains or losses on the sale of securities are currently or will be a major component of net income 
however  the purchase and sale of securities do play a significant part in managing the overall liquidity  credit and interest rate risk of the company 
insurance commission income increased or million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to the acquisition of insurance center of warren by the company s wholly owned subsidiary first place insurance agency  ltd 
in the last half of fiscal other income nonbank subsidiaries increased or million to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in the level of commissions generated by the company s real estate and wealth management affiliates 
over the past several years  the volume and dollar value of loan servicing rights has been growing more rapidly than total assets on a percentage basis 
as a result  the company s exposure to volatility in mortgage banking revenue has also increased 
in order to reduce exposure to volatility due to rapid payoffs or impairment  the company sold msrs with a cost basis of million or approximately of its loan servicing rights during march contrasted with no gain in the current year  this resulted in a gain of million in the prior year 
historically the company has sold loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
however  this was the company s first sale of servicing rights 
mortgage banking gains increased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gains in fiscal averaged basis points on million in sales compared with basis points on million of loan sales in fiscal the primary reason for the increase in basis points was due to the company taking advantage of periods of falling rates during fiscal by conducting loan sales during these periods 
the level of loan originations  sales and gains on the sale of loans are all results that tend to vary inversely with interest rates 
loan activity tends to increase as interest rates decrease and loan activity tends to decrease as interest rates increase 
in conjunction with stable interest rates during fiscal  the company was able to maintain mortgage banking activity levels by selectively adding experienced  successful loan officers and by concentrating on servicing customers purchasing homes over customers seeking refinances of their existing homes 
loan servicing income was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal loan servicing income is composed of the current fees generated from the servicing of sold loans less the current amortization of mortgage servicing rights msrs and the adjustment for any change in the allowance for impairment of msrs  which are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation of msrs is a critical accounting policy and the company utilizes the services of an independent firm to determine market value 
both the amortization and the valuation of msrs are sensitive to movements in interest rates 
both amortization and impairment valuation allowances tend to increase as rates fall and tend to decrease as rates rise 
however  the level of amortization is a function of interest rates over the period while the level of impairment valuation allowances is a function of interest rates at the end of the period 
interest rates were at lower levels two years ago on june  during the past two years  both short term and long term interest rates have varied significantly and have not moved in tandem resulting in significant shifts in the shape and slope of the yield curve 
the level and variability in interest rates over that period has resulted in significant variations in loan servicing income  including changes in the level of impairment of msrs 
the table below shows how the change in the impairment of msrs has impacted loan servicing income over the past two years 
year ended june  dollars in thousands loan servicing income loan servicing revenue net of amortization change in impairment of msrs total loan servicing income loss 
table of contents loan servicing income remained stable due to the increase in loan servicing revenue net of amortization offsetting the decrease in recovery of impairment 
the increase in loan servicing revenue was primarily due to an increase in the size of the servicing portfolio 
the decrease in recovery of impairment was due to long term interest rates rising more slowly during fiscal than they did during fiscal at june   there was no allowance for impairment of msrs 
other income bank decreased or million to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in fees generated on the origination of letters of credit 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the year ended june  totaled million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million or 
annualized noninterest expense as a percent of average assets was for fiscal compared with for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in noninterest expense was the operating expense for the acquired offices of northern and citizens partially offset by decreases in merger  integration and restructuring expense and loan expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased or million to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal for the year ended june   occupancy and equipment increased million to million  marketing increased million to million and amortization of intangible assets increased million to million 
the increases in salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  marketing and amortization of intangible assets were related to the operation of banking offices acquired with northern and citizens 
amortization of intangibles will continue to increase in fiscal due to the purchase of the banking offices from citizens in april  loan expenses decreased million or to million primarily due to a decrease in mortgage loan originations 
state and local tax expense decreased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal other noninterest expenses increased million or to million for the current fiscal year compared to the prior year 
this increase was due to increases in printing and supplies  telephone  deposit operations  real estate owned and other expenses related to growth in the balance sheet and business volumes from the northern and citizens acquisitions 
provision for income taxes 
income tax for the current fiscal year was million  an increase of million from the prior year expense of million 
the increase in the income tax expense was due to the increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the overall effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in pretax income while nontaxable income from municipal securities and life insurance contracts remained relatively constant 
liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to generate adequate cash flows to meet the demands of its customers and provide adequate flexibility for the company to take advantage of market opportunities 
cash is used to fund loans  purchase investments  fund the maturity of liabilities  and at times to fund deposit outflows and operating activities 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and sales of loans  maturities  sales and principal receipts from securities  borrowings  the issuance of debt or equity securities and operations 
managing liquidity entails balancing the need for cash or the ability to borrow against the objectives of maximizing profitability and minimizing interest rate risk 
the most liquid types of assets typically carry the lowest yields 
at june   the company had million of cash and unpledged securities available to meet cash needs 
unpledged securities can be sold or pledged to secure additional borrowings 
in addition  at june   the company had the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank based on assets currently pledged under blanket pledge agreements  and million on unsecured commercial bank lines of credit 
at june   the outstanding balance on the unsecured lines of credit was million 
this compared to million of cash and unpledged securities and federal home loan bank availability of million and million of availability in unsecured commercial bank lines of credit at june  potential cash available as measured by liquid assets and borrowing capacity has decreased million during fiscal due primarily to reductions in securities and in borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank caused by changes in the mix and asset quality characteristics in the loan portfolio 
management receives reports on liquidity on a regular basis and considers the level of liquidity in setting both loan and deposit rates 
in addition to the sources of funds listed above  the company has the ability to raise additional funds by increasing deposit rates relative to competition in national 
table of contents markets  or to sell loans currently held in the loan portfolio 
deposits raised in national markets include brokered deposits 
at june   the company had million of brokered deposits 
brokered deposits are a secondary source of liquidity and can be used as an alternative to local deposits when national rates are lower than local deposit rates 
additionally  the company has the ability to borrow approximately million from the federal reserve bank system 
management believes that the current and potential resources mentioned are adequate to meet liquidity needs in the foreseeable future 
the company  as a savings and loan holding company  has more limited sources of liquidity 
in addition to its existing liquid assets  it can raise funds in the securities markets through debt or equity offerings or it can receive dividends from its subsidiaries 
the bank is the principal subsidiary with the ability to pay significant dividends 
cash can be used by the holding company to make acquisitions  pay quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debentures  pay dividends to common shareholders and to fund operating expenses 
at june   the holding company had cash and unpledged securities of million available to meet cash needs 
annual debt service on the junior subordinated debentures is approximately million 
banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company without prior approval of the ots 
generally the bank may pay dividends without prior approval as long as the dividend is not more than the total of the current calendar year to date earnings plus any earnings from the previous two years not already paid out in dividends  and as long as the bank would remain well capitalized 
as of june   the bank could pay approximately million of dividends without ots approval 
future dividend payments by the bank beyond the million currently available would be based upon future earnings or the approval of the ots 
impact of inflation consolidated financial data included herein has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
presently  gaap requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or deflation are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of the company to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not move concurrently 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
a financial institution s ability to be relatively unaffected by changes in interest rates is a good indicator of its capability to perform in a volatile economic environment 
in an effort to protect itself from the effects of interest rate volatility  the company reviews its interest rate risk position frequently  monitoring its exposure and taking necessary steps to minimize any detrimental effects on the company s profitability 
critical accounting policies the company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
some of these accounting policies require management to make estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain 
application of assumptions different from those used by management could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
these policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
these policies include the policies to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights 
these policies  current assumptions and estimates utilized and the related disclosure of this process are determined by management and reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
details of the policies and the nature of the estimates follow 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
each quarter management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of the loans in the portfolio along with an analysis of external factors 
loans are reviewed individually  or in the case of small homogeneous loans  in the aggregate 
this review includes historical data  the ability of the borrower to meet the terms of the loan  an evaluation of the collateral securing the 
table of contents loan  various collection strategies and other factors relevant to the loan or loans 
external factors considered include but are not limited to economic conditions  current interest rates  trends in the borrower s industry and the market for various types of collateral 
in addition  overall information about the loan portfolio or segments of the portfolio is considered  including industry concentrations  delinquency statistics and workout experience based on factors such as historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and current economic conditions 
as a result  determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses involves not only evaluating the current financial situation of individual borrowers or groups of borrowers but also current predictions about future cash flows that could change before an actual loss is determined 
based on the variables involved and the fact that management must make judgments about outcomes that are uncertain  the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy 
one of the tools utilized by management to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses is the grading of individual loans according to the severity of credit issue 
an illustration of the sensitivity of this system to changes in conditions or changes in estimates follows 
the most serious grading a loan can receive is to be classified as a loss 
a loan classified in the loss grade would be reserved and would be subject to charge off 
the next most serious grade is identified as doubtful 
at june   the company had million of loans classified as doubtful 
if all of these loans were to deteriorate and become classified as a loss the allowance for loan losses would need to increase by approximately million 
mortgage servicing rights 
when the company sells a mortgage loan and retains the rights to service that loan  the amortized cost of the loan is allocated between the loan sold and the mortgage servicing right retained 
the basis assigned to the mortgage servicing right is amortized in proportion to and over the life of the net revenue anticipated to be received from servicing the loan 
mortgage servicing rights are valued at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
fair value is measured by stratifying the portfolio of loan servicing rights into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
when the amortized cost of a group of loans exceeds the fair value  an allowance for impairment is recorded to reduce the value of the mortgage servicing rights to fair value 
fair value for each group of loans is determined quarterly by obtaining an appraisal from an independent third party 
that appraisal is based on a modeling process in conjunction with information on recent bulk and flow sales of mortgage servicing rights 
some of the assumptions used in the modeling process are prepayment speeds  delinquency rates  servicing costs  periods to hold idle cash  returns currently available on idle cash  and a discount rate  which takes into account the current rate of return anticipated by holders of servicing rights 
the process of determining the fair value of servicing rights involves a number of judgments and estimates including the way loans are grouped  the estimation of the various assumptions used by recent buyers and a projection of how those assumptions may change in the future 
the most important variable in valuing servicing rights is the level of interest rates 
long term interest rates are the primary determinant of prepayment speeds while short term interest rates determine the return available on idle cash 
the process of estimating the value of loan servicing rights is further complicated by the fact that short term and long term interest rates may change in a similar magnitude and direction or may change independent of each other 
the following table indicates how changes in assumptions about the prepayment speeds in the mortgage loan servicing portfolio would affect the fair value of the portfolio  as of the date of the most recent outside quarterly evaluation date  may  fair value dollars in thousands fair value of mortgage servicing rights fair value of mortgage servicing rights assuming increase in prepayment speeds increase in prepayment speeds loan prepayment speeds have varied significantly over the past three years and could continue to vary in the future 
in addition  any of the other variables mentioned above could change over time 
therefore  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is  and is expected to continue to be  a critical accounting policy where the results are based on estimates that are subject to change over time and can have a significant financial impact on the company 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company monitors securities in its portfolio for other than temporary impairment 
the company considers various factors in determining if impairment is other than temporary  including but not limited to the length of time and extent the security s fair value has been 
table of contents less than cost  the financial condition and external credit ratings of the issuer  the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value and general market conditions 
in determining if impairment is other than temporary in nature  the company must use certain judgments and assumptions in interpreting market data for the likelihood of recovery in fair value 
securities are written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
other than temporary valuation losses on securities are reported in the consolidated statements of income under the noninterest income caption other than temporary impairment of securities 
subsequent events on september   in a joint statement issued by the us secretary of the treasury and by the director of the newly formed federal housing finance agency fhfa  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed under the conservatorship of the fhfa 
the actions by the fhfa greatly diminished the market value of company s preferred shares of fannie mae held in its securities portfolio 
at june   the fair value of fannie mae preferred stock owned by the company was million 
the market value of these preferred securities on september  was million  or million less than the company s carrying value  or million net of tax 
the company anticipates recording an other than temporary impairment charge in the quarter ended september  any charge recorded for other than temporary impairment at september  could be different from the impairment that existed on september  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to market risk 
market risk is the type of risk that occurs when a company suffers economic loss due to changes in the market value of various types of assets or liabilities 
as a financial institution  the company makes a profit by accepting and managing various risks such as credit risk and interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk 
it is the risk that occurs when changes in market interest rates will result in a reduction in net interest income or net interest margin because interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities mature at different intervals and reprice at different times 
asset liability management is the measurement and analysis of the company s exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the objective of the company s asset liability management function is to balance the goal of maximizing net interest income with the control of risks in the areas of liquidity  safety  capital adequacy and earnings volatility 
in general  the company s customers seek loans with long term fixed rates and deposit products with shorter maturities which creates a mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
the company s primary strategy to counteract this mismatch is to sell the majority of long term fixed rate loans within days after they are closed 
the company manages this risk and other aspects of interest rate risk on a continuing basis through a number of functions including review of monthly financial results  rate setting  cash forecasting and planning  budgeting and an asset liability committee 
on a quarterly basis  the asset liability committee reviews the results of an interest rate risk model that forecasts changes in net interest income and net portfolio value npv  based on one or more interest rate scenarios 
npv is the market value of financial assets less the market value of financial liabilities 
npv is performed as of a single point in time and does not include estimates of future business volumes 
the model combines detailed information on existing assets and liabilities with an interest rate forecast  loan prepayment speed assumptions and assumptions about how those assets and liabilities will react to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  customer product and term selection  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as differences in how interest rates change at various points along the yield curve 
the results below indicate how npv would change based on various changes in interest rates 
the projections are as of june   and a year earlier and are based on an instantaneous change in interest rates and assume that short term and long term rates change by the same magnitude and in the same direction 
basis point june  june  change in net portfolio net portfolio rates value ratio value ratio base the change in the npv ratio is a long term measure of what might happen to the market value of financial assets and liabilities over time if interest rates changed instantaneously and the company did not change existing strategies 
the actual results could be better or worse based on changes in interest rate risk strategies 
the above results at june   indicate the company is exposed to a decline in npv if interest rates rise and would remain almost level in npv if interest rates fell 
in addition  the npv projections indicate that the company has experienced a decrease in its exposure to rising interest rates and a decrease in its potential benefit from falling interest rates at june  compared to june  the npv ratio for no change in rates has decreased basis points at june  compared to june  this model indicates what would be likely to happen given various changes in the level of interest rates but no change in the shape of the yield curve 
the company also has exposure to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the results of the projections are within parameters established by the board of directors 
in addition to the risk of changes in net interest income  the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to loans held for sale and loan commitments 
this is the risk that occurs when changes in interest rates will reduce gains or result in losses on the sale of residential mortgage loans that the company has committed to originate but has not yet contracted to sell 
the company hedges this risk by executing commitments to sell loans or mortgage backed securities based on the volume of committed loans that are likely to close 
additionally  msrs act as a hedge against rising rates  as they becomes more valuable in a rising rate environment  offsetting the decline in the value of loan commitments or loans held for sale in a rising rate environment
