item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rna interference  or rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a broad new class of drugs  like small molecule  protein and antibody drugs 
using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai  we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know how that we expect to apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases 
we are applying our technological expertise to build a pipeline of rnai therapeutics to address significant medical needs  many of which cannot effectively be addressed with small molecules or antibodies  the current major classes of drugs 
our lead rnai therapeutic program  aln rsv  is in phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  infection  which is reported to be the leading cause of hospitalization in infants in the united states and also occurs in the elderly and in immune compromised adults 
in february  we reported positive results from our phase ii experimental infection clinical trials  referred to as the gemini study 
the gemini study was designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability and anti viral activity of aln rsv in this study  aln rsv was safe and well tolerated and demonstrated statistically significant anti viral activity  including an approximately reduction in viral infection and a increase in infection free patients p 
we intend to initiate a second phase ii human clinical trial of aln rsv in naturally infected adult patients during the first half of we submitted an investigational new drug  or ind  application for aln rsv to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  in november  and have completed a number of phase i clinical trials on this experimental drug carried out in both the united states and europe 
the results from these phase i trials and the initial phase ii trial have been presented at medical conferences 
aln rsv was found to be safe and well tolerated when administered intranasally or by nebulizer 
in pre clinical development programs  which are programs for which we have established targeted timing for human clinical trials  we are working on a number of programs including aln pcs  an rnai therapeutic targeting a gene called proprotein convertase subtilisn kexin type  or pcsk  for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  aln vsp  an rnai therapeutic being developed for the treatment of liver cancer and potentially other cancers that is designed to target both vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  and kinesin spindle protein  or ksp  and aln htt  an rnai therapeutic that is designed to target huntington s disease  which we are developing in collaboration with medtronic  inc  or medtronic 
we have pre clinical discovery programs  which are programs for which we have yet to establish targeted timing for human clinical trials  for rnai therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases  including viral hemorrhagic fever  including the ebola virus  progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  a cns disease caused by viral infection in immune compromised patients  pandemic flu  parkinson s disease and cystic fibrosis  the inherited respiratory disease  or cf  as well as other undisclosed programs 
we also are working internally and with third party collaborators to develop the capabilities to deliver our rnai therapeutics directly to specific sites of disease  such as the delivery of aln rsv to the lungs  which we refer to as direct rnai tm 
in addition  we are working to extend our capabilities to advance the development of rnai therapeutics that are administered by intravenous  subcutaneous or intramuscular approaches  which we refer to as systemic rnai tm 
during  we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the liposomal delivery formulation technology of tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation  or tekmira  formerly know as inex pharmaceuticals corporation  for the discovery  development and commercialization of lipid based nanoparticle formulations for the delivery of rnai therapeutics 
we also signed an agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology  or mit  center for cancer research to sponsor an exclusive five year research program focused on the delivery of rnai therapeutics 
we have other rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with academic and corporate third parties  to evaluate different delivery options  including with respect to direct rnai and systemic rnai 

table of contents we rely on the strength of our intellectual property portfolio relating to the development and commercialization of small interfering rnas  or sirnas  as therapeutics 
this includes ownership of  or exclusive rights to  issued patents and pending patent applications claiming fundamental features of sirnas and rnai therapeutics 
we believe that no other company possesses a portfolio of such broad and exclusive rights to the fundamental rnai patents and patent applications required for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
in addition  our expertise in rnai therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate have allowed us to form alliances with leading companies  including f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  or roche  novartis pharma ag  or novartis  medtronic and biogen idec  inc  or biogen idec 
we have also entered into contracts with government agencies  including the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  a component of the national institutes of health  or nih  and the defense threat reduction agency  or dtra  an agency of the united states department of defense  or dod 
we have established collaborations and  in some instances  received funding from a number of major medical and disease associations  including the university of texas southwestern medical center  or utsw  the mayo clinic  the michael j 
fox foundation and the cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics  or cftt 
finally  to further enable the field and monetize our intellectual property rights  we have also entered into approximately license agreements with other biotechnology companies interested in developing rnai therapeutic products and research companies that commercialize rnai reagents or services 
in september  we and isis pharmaceuticals  inc  or isis  established regulus therapeutics llc  or regulus therapeutics  a joint venture focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of microrna  or mirna  therapeutics 
because mirnas are believed to regulate whole networks of genes that can be involved in discrete disease processes  mirna therapeutics represent a new approach to target the pathways of human disease 
regulus therapeutics combines our and isis technologies  know how and intellectual property relating to mirna therapeutics 
we commenced operations in june we have focused our efforts since inception primarily on business planning  research and development  acquiring  filing and expanding intellectual property rights  recruiting management and technical staff  and raising capital 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
through december   we have funded our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sale of equity securities and payments under strategic alliances 
through december   a substantial portion of our total net revenues have been collaboration revenues derived from our strategic alliances with roche  novartis and merck co  inc  or merck  and from the united states government in connection with our development of treatments for hemorrgagic fever viruses  including ebola 
we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from new and existing strategic alliances  government and foundation funding and license fee revenues 
we currently have programs focused in a number of therapeutic areas 
however  we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will be able to commence sales of any product 
we have never achieved profitability on an annual basis and we expect to incur additional losses over the next several years 
we expect our net losses to continue primarily due to research and development activities relating to our drug development programs  collaborations and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of potential funding for the next several years are expected to be derived primarily from payments under new and existing strategic alliances  which may include license and other fees  funded research and development payments and milestone payments  government and foundation funding and proceeds from the sale of equity 
research and development since our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses 
our most advanced program is focused on the treatment of rsv infection 
our other development programs are focused on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  liver cancer and potentially other cancers  and huntington s disease 
we also have discovery programs to develop rnai therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of diseases  including viral hemorrhagic fever  including the ebola virus  pml  pandemic flu  parkinson s disease  cf  several other diseases that are the subject of our collaboration with novartis  and other undisclosed programs 
in addition  we are working internally 
table of contents and with external collaborators to develop the capabilities to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to the specific sites of disease and systemically and we intend to continue to collaborate with academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons  including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including rnai 
the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain 
due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any potential product candidate 
these risks include the uncertainty of our ability to progress any product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  particularly those related to developing safe and effective ways of delivering sirnas into cells and tissues  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms  timing and success of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost  timing and success of regulatory filings and approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in item a above under the heading risk factors 
strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  research foundations and others  as appropriate  to gain access to funding  technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues 
we have entered into license agreements with max planck innovation  tekmira  mit and isis  as well as a number of other entities  to obtain rights to important intellectual property in the field of rnai 
in addition  our collaboration strategy is to form non exclusive platform alliances where our collaborators obtain access to our capabilities and intellectual property to develop their own rnai therapeutic products and co development and or ex us market geographic partnerships on specific rnai therapeutic programs 
we have entered into a broad  non exclusive platform license agreement with roche  under which we and roche also will collaborate on rnai drug discovery for one or more disease targets 
we also have discovery and development alliances with novartis and medtronic 
two of the programs we are pursuing under our alliances with novartis and medtronic are co development programs 
we have also entered into contracts with government agencies  including niaid and dtra 
we have established collaborations and in some instances  received funding from  a number of major medical and disease associations including utsw  the mayo clinic  the michael j 
fox foundation and the cftt 
to further enable the field and monetize our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our interferx tm program for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest 
as of february   we had granted such licenses  on both an 
table of contents exclusive and nonexclusive basis  to approximately companies  and options to take such licenses to two additional companies 
roche 
in july  we and  for limited purposes  alnylam europe ag  or alnylam europe  entered into a license and collaboration agreement with roche 
under the license and collaboration agreement  which became effective in august  we granted roche a non exclusive license to our intellectual property to develop and commercialize therapeutic products that function through rnai  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the license is initially limited to the therapeutic areas of oncology  respiratory diseases  metabolic diseases and certain liver diseases  and may be expanded to include other therapeutic areas upon payment of an additional specified amount 
in consideration for the rights granted to roche under the license and collaboration agreement  roche paid us million in upfront cash payments 
roche is also required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones set forth in the license and collaboration agreement and royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any  of rnai therapeutic products by roche  its affiliates and sublicensees 
under the license and collaboration agreement  we and roche also agreed to collaborate on the discovery of rnai therapeutic products directed to one or more disease targets  subject to our contractual obligations to third parties 
the collaboration between roche and us will be governed by a joint steering committee for a period of five years that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
in exchange for our contributions to the collaboration  roche will be required to make additional milestone and royalty payments 
in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement  in august  we executed a common stock purchase agreement with roche finance  pursuant to which roche finance purchased  shares of our common stock at per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement and the common stock purchase agreement  we also executed a stock purchase agreement with alnylam europe and roche germany 
under the terms of the alnylam europe stock purchase agreement  we created a new  wholly owned german limited liability company  roche kulmbach  into which substantially all of the non intellectual property assets of alnylam europe were transferred  and roche germany purchased from us all of the issued and outstanding shares of roche kulmbach for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in connection with the license and collaboration agreement and the common stock purchase agreement  we incurred million of license fees payable to our licensors  primarily isis  in accordance with the applicable license agreements with those parties 
novartis 
we have formed two alliances with novartis 
we refer to the first of these  which was initiated in september  as the broad novartis alliance  and to the second  which was initiated in february  as the novartis flu alliance 
in october  novartis purchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of million  which  immediately after such issuance  represented of our then outstanding common stock 
novartis owned approximately of our common stock as of december  under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement governing the broad novartis alliance  the parties agreed to work together on selected targets  as defined in the collaboration and license agreement  to discover and develop therapeutics based on rnai 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an upfront payment of million to us in october  partly to reimburse prior costs incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
in addition  the collaboration and license agreement includes terms under which novartis agreed to provide us with research funding and milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration 
the collaboration and license agreement also provides novartis with a non exclusive option to integrate our intellectual property relating to rnai technology into novartis operations under specified circumstances 
in connection with the exercise of the integration option  novartis will be required to make additional payments to us 

table of contents in february  we entered into the novartis flu alliance 
the agreement governing the flu alliance is structured as an addendum to the collaboration and license agreement for the broad novartis alliance 
under the terms of the novartis flu agreement  we and novartis have joint responsibility for development of rnai therapeutics for pandemic flu 
we are eligible to receive significant funding from novartis for our efforts on rnai therapeutics for pandemic flu  and to receive a significant share of any profits 
during  we and novartis agreed to focus on additional pre clinical research prior to advancing this program into development 
medtronic 
in july  we entered into an amended and restated collaboration agreement with medtronic to pursue the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders 
the amended and restated collaboration agreement supersedes the collaboration agreement entered into by the parties in february  and continues the existing collaboration between the parties focusing on the delivery of rnai therapeutics to specific areas of the brain using implantable infusion systems 
under the terms of the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we and medtronic will continue our existing development program focused on developing a combination drug device product for the treatment of huntington s disease 
in addition  as provided for in our initial collaboration agreement with medtronic  the parties may jointly agree to collaborate on additional product development programs for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases  which can be addressed by the delivery of small interfering rnas  or sirnas  discovered and developed using our rnai therapeutics platform  to the human nervous system through implantable infusion devices developed by medtronic 
we will be responsible for supplying the sirna component and medtronic will be responsible for supplying the device component of any product resulting from the collaboration 
with respect to the initial product development program focused on huntington s disease  the parties will each fund of the development efforts for the united states while medtronic is responsible for funding development efforts outside the united states 
medtronic will commercialize any resulting products and pay royalties to us based on net sales of any such products  which royalties in the united states are designed to approximate of the profit associated with the sale of such product and which royalties in europe are similar to more traditional pharmaceutical royalties  in that they are intended to reflect each party s contribution 
each party has the right to opt out of its obligation to fund the program under the agreement at certain stages  and the agreement provides for revised economics based on the timing of any such opt out 
other than pursuant to the initial product development program  and subject to specified exceptions  neither party may research  develop  manufacture or commercialize products that use implanted infusion devices for the direct delivery of sirnas to the human nervous system to treat huntington s disease during the term of such program 
biogen idec 
in september  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with biogen idec 
the collaboration is focused on the discovery and development of therapeutics based on rnai for the potential treatment of pml 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we granted biogen idec an exclusive license to distribute  market and sell certain rnai therapeutics to treat pml and biogen idec has agreed to fund all related research and development activities 
we also received an upfront million payment from biogen idec 
in addition  upon the successful development and utilization of a product resulting from the collaboration  if any  biogen idec would be required to pay us milestone and royalty payments 
the pace and scope of future development of this program is the responsibility of biogen idec 
we expect limited resources to be expended on this program in isis 
in march  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with isis  a leading developer of single stranded antisense oligonucleotide drugs that target rna 
the agreement enhanced our intellectual property position with respect to rna based therapeutic products and our ability to develop double stranded rna for rnai therapeutic products  and provided us with the opportunity to defer investment in manufacturing technology 
we also agreed to pay milestone payments  payable upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties to isis for each product that we or a collaborator develops utilizing isis intellectual property 
in addition  we agreed to pay to isis a percentage of specified fees from strategic collaborations we may enter into that include access to the isis intellectual property 
isis also agreed to pay us a license fee  milestone payments  payable upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties for each product developed by isis or a collaborator that utilizes our intellectual property 
the agreement also gives us an option to use isis manufacturing services for rna based therapeutic products 
in august  as a result of certain payments 
table of contents received by us in connection with the roche alliance  we made payments totaling million to isis 
in october  as a result of certain payments received by us in connection with the novartis agreements  we made payments totaling million to isis 
these license fees were charged to research and development expenses in their respective periods 
our agreement with isis also gives us the exclusive right to grant sub licenses for isis technology to third parties with whom we are not collaborating 
we may include these sub licenses in our interferx licenses 
if a license includes rights to isis intellectual property  we will share revenues from that license equally with isis 
nih 
in september  we were awarded a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic against hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus  with niaid 
the federal contract will provide us with up to million in funding over a four year period to develop  as anti viral drugs targeting the ebola virus 
of the million  the government has committed to pay us million over the first two years of the contract and  subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations in future years  the remaining million over the last two years of the contract 
department of defense 
in august  we were awarded a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic for hemorrhagic fever virus by dtra 
this federal contract is expected to provide us with up to million in funding through the second quarter of to develop rnai therapeutics for hemorrhagic fever virus 
viral hemorrhagic fevers are considered by federal agencies to be high priority agents that pose a potential risk to national security because they can be easily transmitted from person to person  result in high mortality rates and require special action for public health preparedness 
this contract is with the dtra medical science and technology chemical and biological defense transformational medical technologies initiative  whose mission is to provide state of the art defense capabilities to united states military personnel by addressing traditional and non traditional biological threats 
of the million in funding  the government has committed to pay us up to million through april and  subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations in future years  the remaining million over the last two years of the contract 
delivery technology 
we are working to extend our capabilities in developing technology to achieve efficacious and safe delivery of rnai therapeutics to a broad spectrum of organ and tissue types 
in connection with these efforts  we have entered into a number of agreements to evaluate and gain access to certain delivery technologies 
in some instances  we are also providing funding to support the advancement of these delivery technologies 
merck 
in september  we terminated our amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement with merck 
pursuant to the termination agreement  all license grants of intellectual property to develop  manufacture and or commercialize rnai therapeutic products under the amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement ceased as of the date of the termination agreement  subject to certain specified exceptions 
the termination agreement further provides that  subject to certain conditions  we and merck will each retain sole ownership and rights in our own intellectual property 
we have no remaining deliverables under the amended and restated research collaboration and license agreement 
joint venture regulus therapeutics llc in september  we and isis established regulus therapeutics  a joint venture focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of mirna therapeutics 
because mirnas are believed to regulate whole networks of genes that can be involved in discrete disease processes  mirna therapeutics represent a new approach to target the pathways of human disease 
regulus therapeutics combines the strengths and assets of our and isis technologies  know how and intellectual property relating to mirna therapeutics 
in addition  we believe regulus therapeutics has assembled a strong leadership team  as well as leading authorities in the field of mirna research to lead this new venture 
regulus therapeutics most advanced program is an mirna therapeutic that targets mir for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection  a significant disease worldwide for which emerging therapies target viral genes and  therefore  are prone to viral resistance 
regulus therapeutics is targeting mir  an endogenous host gene required for viral infection by hcv 
in addition to the mir program  regulus therapeutics is also actively 
table of contents exploring additional areas for development of mirna therapeutics  including cancer  other viral diseases  metabolic disorders and inflammatory diseases 
we and isis own and  respectively  of regulus therapeutics 
regulus therapeutics is operated as an independent company with a separate board of directors  scientific advisory board and management team 
in connection with the execution of the limited liability company agreement  we  isis and regulus therapeutics entered into a license and collaboration agreement to pursue the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic products directed to mirnas 
under the terms of the license and collaboration agreement  we and isis assigned to regulus therapeutics specified patents and contracts covering mirna specific technology 
in addition  each of us granted to regulus therapeutics an exclusive  worldwide license under our rights to other mirna related patents and know how to develop and commercialize therapeutic products containing compounds that are designed to interfere with or inhibit a particular mirna  subject to our and isis existing contractual obligations to third parties 
regulus therapeutics also has the right to request a license from us and isis to develop and commercialize therapeutic products directed to other mirna compounds  which license is subject to our and isis approval and to each such party s existing contractual obligations to third parties 
regulus therapeutics also grants to us and isis an exclusive license to technology developed or acquired by regulus therapeutics for use solely within our respective fields as defined in the license and collaboration agreement  but specifically excluding the right to develop  manufacture or commercialize the therapeutic products for which we and isis granted rights to regulus therapeutics 
in addition  we made an initial cash contribution to regulus therapeutics of million  resulting in us and isis making initial capital contributions to regulus therapeutics of approximately equal aggregate value 
after a sufficient portfolio of data is obtained with respect to each mirna compound drug candidate developed by regulus therapeutics  regulus therapeutics may elect to continue to pursue the development and commercialization of products directed to such mirna compound and related mirna compounds  in which event regulus therapeutics would be obligated to pay us and isis a royalty on net sales of any such resulting products 
if regulus therapeutics decides not to continue to pursue the development and commercialization of products directed to particular mirna compounds  either we or isis may pursue development and commercialization of such regulus therapeutics products 
development and commercialization of such products by either party would be subject to the payment to regulus therapeutics of a specified upfront fee  royalties on net sales  milestone payments upon achievement of specified regulatory events and a portion of income received from sublicensing rights 
in connection with the execution of the limited liability company agreement and the license and collaboration agreement  we also executed a services agreement with isis and regulus therapeutics 
under the terms of the services agreement  we and isis agreed to provide to regulus therapeutics  for the benefit of regulus therapeutics  certain research and development and general and administrative services  as set forth in an operating plan mutually agreed upon by us and isis 
pursuant to this agreement  we and isis generally will be paid by regulus therapeutics for these services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 

table of contents the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and pre clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  or eitf non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have stand alone value or have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the proportional performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the proportional performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  then revenue under the arrangement would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the provisions of eitf eitf addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of 
table of contents both cumulative revenue recorded to date and of probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   we have short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to the next twelve months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan and  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next twelve month period 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
roche 
we recorded million as deferred revenue in connection with the roche alliance 
this amount represents the aggregate proceeds received from roche  million  net of the amount allocated for financial statement purposes to the common stock issuance of million  and the net book value of alnylam europe of million 
roche is also required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones set forth in the license and collaboration agreement and royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any  of rnai therapeutic products by roche  its affiliates and sublicensees 
in addition  we have agreed with roche to collaborate on the discovery of rnai therapeutic products directed to one or more disease targets  referred to as the discovery collaboration  subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
the collaboration between roche and us will be governed by a joint steering committee for a period of five years that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
our performance obligations under the license and collaboration agreement  including participation in the steering committee and research conducted as part of the discovery collaboration  are expected to cease five years from the effective date of the license and collaboration agreement 
the proceeds allocated to the common stock issuance of million were based on the fair value on the date the shares were issued 
we have concluded that the license issued to roche  the steering committee services and the services we will be required to perform under the discovery collaboration should be treated as a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  the remaining consideration received has been recorded as deferred revenue and will be amortized into revenue over the five year period during which we are required to provide services under the license and collaboration agreement 
we are initially recording revenue on a straight line basis over five years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the total level of effort required under the license and collaboration agreement 
when  and if  we are able to make reasonable estimates of our remaining efforts under the collaboration  we will modify the method of recognition and utilize the proportional performance method 
as future milestones are achieved  and to the extent they are within the five year term  the amounts will be recognized as revenue prospectively over the remaining period of performance

in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an up front payment of million to us in october to partly reimburse costs previously incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
in addition  the collaboration and license agreement includes terms under which novartis agreed to provide us with research funding and milestone payments as well as royalties 
table of contents on annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration and license agreement 
we initially recorded as deferred revenue the non refundable million up front payment and million premium that represents the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of our common stock on the date of the stock purchase from novartis 
in addition to these payments  research funding and certain milestone payments will be amortized into revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated duration of the novartis agreement  or ten years 
we only include milestone payments that we believe are probable of being received 
under this method  we estimate the level of effort to be expended over the term of the agreement and recognize revenue based on the lesser of the amount calculated based on the proportional performance of total expected revenue or the amount of non refundable payments earned 
we believe the estimated term of the novartis agreement includes the three year term of the agreement  two one year extensions at the election of novartis and limited support as part of a technology transfer until the fifth anniversary of the termination of the agreement 
therefore  an expected term of ten years is used in the proportional performance model 
we will evaluate the expected term when new information is known that could affect our estimate 
in the event our period of involvement is different than we estimated  revenue recognition will be adjusted on a prospective basis 
government contracts 
revenue under government cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as we perform the underlying research and development activities 
accounting for income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin  which clarifies the accounting for income tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on the derecognition of previously recognized deferred tax items  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under fin  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we operate in the united states and germany where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
we develop our cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from our current estimate may result in additional tax expense in future periods 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  that will expire at various dates beginning in through at december   federal and state research and development and other credit carryforwards were million and million  respectively  available to reduce future tax liabilities  that will expire at various dates beginning in through at december   foreign tax credits were million  available to reduce future tax liabilities  that expire in we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  including those associated with these carryforwards  will not be realized and  accordingly  have recorded a full valuation allowance 
this assessment was based on our estimates of future taxable income which involve significant judgment 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  stock based compensation expense is recognized beginning in for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and compensation cost for all stock based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
such amounts are reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock awards granted under our compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
all stock based awards granted to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas  as amended  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf  under which compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of implied volatilities of similar entities whose share or option prices are publicly available as well as the historical volatility of our publicly traded stock 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility assumption of 
due to our short history of being a public company  after adopting sfas r  we estimated the expected life of option grants made through september  using the simplified method prescribed under staff accounting bulletin no 
since the grants qualify as plain vanilla options 
this method averages the contractual term of the stock options years with the vesting term years 
during the three months ended december   we changed our expected life assumption to be based on the equal weighting of the historical data of i our stock price and ii the stock prices of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology peers 
our weighted average expected term was years for the year ended december  we utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
as of december   the estimated fair value of unvested employee awards was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
this amount will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years for these awards 
stock based employee compensation expense was million for the year ended december  however  the total amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in any future period cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will actually vest  and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
accounting for joint venture we account for our interest in regulus therapeutics using the equity method of accounting 
we have concluded that regulus therapeutics qualifies as a variable interest entity under fasb interpretation no 
r  
table of contents consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 or fin r 
the limited liability company agreement contains transfer restrictions on each of isis and our interests and  as a result  we and isis are considered related parties under paragraph d of fin r 
because we and isis are related parties and collectively own of regulus therapeutics  the determination of which entity would be considered the primary beneficiary is based on which entity is most closely associated with regulus therapeutics 
following the guidance in paragraph of fin r  we have concluded that isis is the primary beneficiary and  accordingly  we have not consolidated regulus therapeutics and account for our investment under the equity method of accounting

we received upfront payments totaling million under the roche alliance  of which million was allocated to the purchase of  shares of our common stock and million is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over five years under the roche alliance 
the alnylam europe stock purchase agreement also includes transition services to be performed by roche kulmbach employees at various levels through august we reimburse roche for these services at an agreed upon rate 
we recorded million of these services as contra revenue a reduction of revenues during the decrease in novartis revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to a decrease in the number of resources allocated to the broad novartis alliance 
the decrease in novartis revenues was also due to a decrease in the number of resources allocated to  as well as lower external expense reimbursement under  our novartis flu alliance  as a result of the shift in focus during on additional pre clinical research prior to advancing the pandemic flu program into development 
for the year ended december   government contract revenues increased as a result of our collaboration with niaid  which began in the fourth quarter of  and our collaboration with dtra  which began in the third quarter of 
table of contents other research collaborator revenues consisted primarily of research funding and amortization of upfront payments or license fees from biogen idec and merck 
the increase in other research collaborator revenues in is primarily the result of our collaboration with biogen idec  which began in the fourth quarter of and the termination of our merck collaboration agreement in september we were recognizing the remaining deferred revenue under the merck agreement on a straight line basis over the remaining period of expected performance of four years 
as a result of the termination  we recognized an aggregate of million during the third quarter of  which represented all of the remaining deferred revenue under the merck agreement 
the decrease in interferx program  research reagent licenses and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was due to upfront payments pursuant to license agreements entered into under our interferx program in the prior year 
total deferred revenues of million at december  consists of payments received from collaborators  primarily roche  that we have yet to recognize pursuant to our revenue recognition policies 
for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from strategic alliances  collaborations  government contracts and licensing activities and to continue to increase significantly as a result of our august alliance with roche

table of contents payments due to certain entities  primarily isis  in connection with the roche alliance and million in charges for licenses for certain delivery technologies 
the increase was also due to an increase in clinical trial and manufacturing expenses in support of our clinical program for rsv  for which we began phase ii trials in june  as well as higher manufacturing expenses related to our pre clinical development programs 
the increase in external services was due to higher expenses related to our pre clinical programs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  liver cancer and ebola  as well as higher expenses associated with our delivery related collaborations 
the increase in compensation related expenses and facilities related expenses was due to additional research and development headcount over the past year to support our alliances and expanding product pipeline 
the increase in non cash stock based compensation was due primarily to one time charges of million from restricted stock grants and stock option modifications in august relating to the transfer of our former german employees to roche kulmbach as part of our alliance with roche 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development expenses and  excluding the impact of the license fees we paid as a result of the roche alliance in  we expect that research and development expenses will increase in as we continue development of our and our collaborators product candidates and focus on delivery related technologies 
we do not track most of our research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a project by project basis because all of our programs are in the early stages of development 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development costs is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
however  our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements whereby certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed 
costs reimbursed under the agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full time equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project 
in addition  we are reimbursed under our government contracts for certain allowable costs including direct internal and external costs 
as a result  although a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project by project basis  we do track direct external costs attributable to  and the actual time our employees worked on  our collaborations and government contracts

the increase in compensation and related expenses was due primarily to an increase in headcount to support the overall corporate growth of the company

other research collaborator revenues consist of revenues from biogen idec  merck  niaid and other government and foundation revenues 
the decrease in revenues from other research collaborators was related to a million decrease in revenues related primarily to our merck ocular disease collaboration  for which development was suspended in september based on portfolio management and commercial factors 
the decrease in other research collaborator revenues was partially offset by niaid revenues as well as biogen idec revenues during  which consisted of research and development funding and amortization revenues of the million up front payment 
in addition to our collaboration agreements  we have an interferx program under which we have licensed our intellectual property to others for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics in narrowly defined therapeutic areas in which we are not currently engaged 
we have also granted licenses to our intellectual property to others for the development and commercialization of research reagents and services 
we expect these programs to provide revenues from license fees and royalties on sales by the licensees  subject to limitations under our agreements with novartis

operating activities we have required significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities as a result of net losses since our inception 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the proceeds received from our august alliance with roche 
offsetting the proceeds from the roche alliance  the main components of our use of cash in operating activities for the year ended december  consisted of the net loss and changes in our working capital 
cash used in operating activities is adjusted for non cash items to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities 
these non cash adjustments consist primarily of non cash license fees  stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
we had an increase in deferred revenue of million for the year ended december  due to the proceeds received from our roche alliance 
additionally  accrued expenses and collaboration receivables increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we expect that we will require significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and advance our research and development initiatives 
the actual amount of overall expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses  the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  if any  and the timing and progress of our research and development efforts

for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of the aggregate net proceeds of million from our follow on public offerings in january and december in march  we entered into an agreement with oxford finance corporation  or oxford  to establish an equipment line of credit for up to million to help support capital expansion of our facility in cambridge  massachusetts and capital equipment purchases

all draw downs began to be repaid over months beginning september  on the maturity of each equipment advance under the line of credit  we are required to pay  in addition to the principal and interest due  an additional amount of of the original principal 
this amount is being accrued over the applicable borrowing period as additional interest expense 
at december   we had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million under all of our loan agreements 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing resources  together with the cash we expect to generate under our current alliances  including our roche alliance  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next several years  during which time we expect to further the development of our product candidates  extend the capabilities of our technology platform  conduct clinical trials and continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent portfolio 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to develop  commence clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates 
in the longer term  we may seek additional funding through additional collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue

the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our marketable securities consist of us government obligations  corporate debt and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a decrease in market interest rates at december  would impact the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments by million 
a downgrade in the credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in the fair value of the debt instrument 
we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to our marketable securities as of december
