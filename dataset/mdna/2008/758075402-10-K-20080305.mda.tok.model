item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary redwood trust  inc  together with its subsidiaries redwood  we  or us  is a financial institution focused on investing in  financing  and managing residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
we seek to invest in assets that have the potential to provide high cash flow returns over a long period of time to help support our goal of distributing attractive levels of dividends per share 
for tax purposes  we are structured as a real estate investment trust reit 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which equals the interest income we earn from our investments in loans and securities less the interest expenses we incur from our borrowed funds and other liabilities 
we assume a range of risks in our investments and the level of assumed risk dictates the manner in which we finance our purchase of and derive income from these investments 
our investments in residential  commercial  and collateralized debt obligation cdo credit enhancement securities ces  or below investment grade securities have concentrated credit risk 
we finance the acquisition of most of our first loss and equivalent ces that are directly exposed to credit losses with capital 
to date  our primary credit enhancement investment focus has been in securities backed by high quality residential and commercial real estate loans 
high quality real estate loans are loans that typically have low loan to value ratios  borrowers with strong credit histories  and other indications of quality relative to the range of loans within us real estate markets as a whole 
our ces investment returns depend on the amount and timing of the interest and principal collected on the loans in the pools supporting the securities 
in an ideal environment  for most of our residential ces  we would experience fast loan prepayments and low credit losses which would  in turn  lead to attractive ces returns 
conversely  the return on most of our residential ces investments would be adversely affected by slow loan prepayments and high credit losses 
we also make investments in the securitization entities we sponsor sequoia and acacia 
the sequoia entities hold real estate loans 
the acacia entities generally hold investment grade securities igs  which have less concentrated credit risk than ces  as well as some second loss  third loss  and equivalent securities 
the income we earn on our investment in the equity of these securitization entities is based upon the spread between the yield on the assets owned by each entity and the cost of funds borrowed to fund those assets 
the cost of funds is the interest paid on the asset backed securities abs issued by each of these entities 
each entity is independent of redwood and of each other and the assets and obligations are not owned by and are not obligations of redwood 
during  the most significant factor affecting our consolidated financial statements was the extensive price decline in real estate securities that began early in the year and continued unabated through the end of the fourth quarter 
this price decline caused a substantial decline in our reported gaap book value and earnings 
we believe the real economic impact on redwood is significantly less severe than the financial reporting impact reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the primary reason for the divergence between economics and gaap relates to the accounting treatment required for our investments in the acacia securitization entities 
for accounting purposes  we consolidate the balance sheets and income statements of the acacia securitization entities 
in  we were required  for financial statement purposes  to mark to market mtm all of the assets of acacia to fair value  but we were not permitted to mtm paired liabilities 
the gaap accounting treatment resulted in a carrying value for our investments in acacia of a negative billion at december  on january   we elected to adopt a new accounting standard  sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas  to value the assets and liabilities of the acacia entities 
this new standard significantly improved the disparity that existed between the gaap carrying value of our acacia investments and our estimate of the economic value of those investments 
in accordance with fas  we recorded a one time  cumulative effect adjustment to our balance sheet that increased the balance of our stockholders equity at january  by billion 
our reported consolidated stockholders equity at december  was a negative million 
after giving affect to the adoption of fas  our reported gaap stockholders equity at january  was a positive million 

table of contents results in  our reported gaap net loss was billion per share compared to gaap net income of million per share in we paid per share in dividends in consisting of per share in regular dividends and a per share special dividend 
our board of directors has announced its intention to maintain the regular dividend at per share per quarter in table net income

another factor negatively affecting our net income relative to the prior year was a million decline in gains generated from sales and calls of assets 
operating expenses increased from million in to million in as a result an increase in headcount and a reorganization of our residential and commercial operations  partially offset by a decrease in bonus awards as a result of the company s gaap results 
on the positive side  our operating results in were strong 
net interest income increased to million in  up from million in this increase in net interest income was attributable to higher net interest income from our ces and igs partially offset by a decline in the aggregate net interest income from our sequoia investments caused by a reduction in the volume of loans held by the sequoia entities in relative to provision for income taxes decreased from million in to million in our estimated taxable income in was per share  as compared to per share in  and our reit taxable income in was per share  as compared with per share in our reit taxable income determines the minimum amount of dividends we must distribute in order to maintain our tax status as a reit 
taxable income continues to run higher than gaap income as we are not permitted to establish credit reserves or recognize mtm adjustments impairments for tax purposes 
we amortize more of our ces discount into income for tax purposes  generally do not record impairments for tax purposes  and have a higher tax basis in these securities 
consequently  any future credit losses on our ces will have a more significant impact on taxable income and reit taxable income compared to gaap income 
see potential income tax volatility later in this document 
the non gaap pro forma consolidating income statement shown below highlights the significant impact from the consolidation of acacia securitization entities on our overall results 
for the reasons described in the mark to market adjustments discussion below  we believe the net economic loss from our acacia investments was significantly less than the net loss of billion reported under gaap

year ended december  in millions redwood parent only sequoia acacia redwood consolidated net interest income operating expenses realized gains on sales and calls  net market valuation adjustments  net  net loss income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income   this is a non gaap presentation 
in a gaap presentation  the redwood income column shown above would reflect the income from sequoia and the loss from acacia 
it is likely that we will continue to experience earnings volatility as a result of mtm adjustments in in particular  prices for real estate securities have continued to decline in the first quarter of we may also encounter further mtm adjustments from impairments on ces held at redwood and from the consolidation of acacia entities even after the adoption of fas these items are discussed in detail in the mark to market adjustments discussion that follows 
we believe that it is highly likely that the net interest income contribution from our existing acacia investments will be lower in in comparison to cash distributions from our acacia investments can be disrupted based on credit rating agencies downgrades of the underlying collateral or due to deterioration in collateral performance 
our investment in each of these entities is separate and independent  thus diminished performance for one of our investments would have no effect on our investments in the other acacia entities 
we believe there is a strong likelihood that cash flows from our investments in four of the acacia entities could be disrupted in the first or second quarter of and the cash flows from our investment in a fifth acacia entity could be disrupted within a year 
during the year ended december   the net interest income reported from our investments in these five entities was million of the million total net interest income shown in the table above 
market conditions and activity a broad re evaluation of residential and commercial mortgage credit risk and the subsequent reduction in market values began early in the year and continued unabated through the end of the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of the most dramatic negative price adjustments involved residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and cdo securities backed by subprime and alt a mortgages originated in and 
table of contents the table below illustrates the additional interest rate spread that investors have required to compensate for the perceived additional credit risk of various types of rmbs and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 

graphic missing 
we believe several converging factors led to the broad decline in capital markets pricing for rmbs  cmbs  and cdo securities which  in turn  negatively affected our operating results and caused us to incur dramatic negative mark to market valuation adjustments against our securities portfolio 
these factors included declines in residential and commercial real estate prices  a rapid increase in the number of delinquent residential mortgage loans  a reduced willingness of investors to acquire commercial paper or other short term debt backed by mortgage collateral  credit rating downgrades by credit rating agencies of numerous mortgage backed securities and of bond insurers  overall contraction in market liquidity  forced selling  caused by margin calls and other factors  the impact of speculation in related derivatives markets  and a general unwillingness of investors to acquire assets in a falling market 
in addition  market trading activity during the second half of was unusually light 
we believe that uncertainty related to future loss estimates made it difficult for willing buyers and sellers to agree on price 
correspondingly  new securitization activity was low throughout the second half of and remained at low levels into the first quarter of these changing market conditions have impacted our activities and operations in a variety of ways  while our core focus has remained consistent 
over the past few years  we have focused on establishing a foundation for growth 
we have laid this foundation by diversifying our investment and financing capabilities  strengthening the redwood team  and bolstering our systems and infrastructure 
these remain top priorities for us going forward 
at the same time  however  the manner in which we utilize these resources has evolved  and will continue to do so  in response to changing market conditions 
during the first half of  when market conditions began to show signs of a correction  we closely monitored our acquisition decisions while continuing to acquire real estate securities  both as investments and for planned acacia cdo entities  as well as loans for planned sequoia entities 
as market conditions became more turbulent toward the end of the second quarter and through the third quarter  we reduced our acquisition activity  focusing instead on strengthening our liquidity position and freeing up capital for deployment into higher yielding assets 
during the fourth quarter  while continuing to focus on maintaining the strength of our capital base  we began to take advantage of some of the acquisition opportunities created by the current market conditions 

table of contents the majority of our residential ces was originated during or prior to  and these securities continue to perform in line with or better than our original expectations 
the prime and alt a loans backing these seasoned ces have generally exhibited strong payment histories and declining loan to value ratios due to principal pay downs and home price appreciation in the earlier years of those loans 
in contrast  our residential ces originated in and are performing below our original expectations 
we have assessed our exposure to these vintages million or of total residential ces and believe we were adequately reserved for credit losses at december  our commercial ces portfolio continues to perform well in the face of weakening fundamentals for this asset class in general 
serious delinquencies on commercial loans underlying ces are still near industry historic lows 
we expect industry default rates to increase and approach during as expected with diverse cmbs collateral pools  we continue to experience isolated defaults that have not been indicative of overall performance trends to date 
we believe that our credit reserves adequately provided for expected losses on all of our credit sensitive commercial securities at december  we expect that an economic stimulus package recently passed by congress  which raises conforming limits for freddie mac and fannie mae eligible loans  will have a modest positive impact on our credit enhancement portfolio 
the long term impact  however  remains unclear 
capital and liquidity our excess capital position was million at december   an increase from the million we had at the end of our sources of capital during the year were million from stock issuance  million from the issuance of subordinated notes  million from portfolio cash flows in excess of our operating costs  and million from asset sales to third parties and our securitization entities 
during the year  we used million of capital for new investments and million of capital for dividend payments 
our year end liquidity position remained strong at million 
redwood debt short term debt not included in capital was million at the end of the year 
we continue to have no liquidity issues or need to sell assets and  using our excess capital  have commenced investing in new long term assets 
although we intend to be cautious in deploying our capital in  we believe there may be extraordinary opportunities in to make new investments with long term earnings potential at attractive prices 
price levels for many real estate assets are now at historic lows  providing a substantial cushion against future losses 
we have begun to see compelling long term value in many new and seasoned assets  in spite of the price volatility that we and other market participants will continue to experience over the near term 
we deployed a significant amount of capital during the fourth quarter of million  and we believe our rate of capital deployment could increase in the velocity of forced liquidations of seasoned assets at attractive prices by many financial institutions is increasing  and we expect new opportunities to arise to credit enhance new loans originated to much higher quality standards 
we expect to continue financing these types of credit sensitive investments with capital  either on our own or with third party capital sourced through opportunity funds or other asset management vehicles 
given the opportunities in front of us  we will likely seek to raise additional redwood capital in  assuming capital can be raised in a manner that is accretive to earnings given our planned capital uses 
outlook we expect that over the next two to three years  we will likely experience delinquencies and credit losses that will increase materially on a percentage basis in comparison to the low levels we experienced over the last few years 
we believe we have established appropriate reserves for these increased losses  however  and we expect most of our assets to produce healthy economic returns even with the increased losses that we currently anticipate 
that being said  we do not know how long or how severe this credit cycle will be  and our current expectations about the level of future losses could be overly optimistic 
overall  we believe the most appropriate expectation over the next few years is that credit losses will escalate and likely reduce the amount of our special dividends 
in a severe case a case that we are not expecting despite current market turmoil taxable income alone may be less than our regular dividend for some period of time 

table of contents on the positive side for redwood  the real estate and capital markets excesses of the past continue to get wrung out of the system  which we believe will make for a positive longer run future for us 
real estate is beginning to return to sound fundamentals  competition has been reduced  and there are some prospects for new forms of credit enhancement to arise in the future where we could be competitive 
additionally  asset prices continue to fall  and assets are beginning to change hands after several months during which there was little market activity  so our search for new acquisition opportunities is becoming more interesting 
after a painful year for our industry  we believe we have emerged from as one of the companies best positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lay ahead 
the strength of our balance sheet allowed us to weather the current liquidity crisis and build for the future 
overall  we believe the long term outlook for redwood is favorable  although the near and medium term will likely remain difficult 
as a survivor and a leader  we will have an opportunity to define the new operating models in our space in the future 
mark to market adjustments discussion accounting and economics the rules regarding mark to market mtm accounting are complex and may not clearly reflect the underlying economics 
this accounting and economic discussion is intended to provide investors with a better understanding of the impact of mtm adjustments on our reported financial results 
mtm adjustments can result from changes in fair values caused either by a change in expected cash flows ie increased credit loss estimates reducing expected cash flows  or a change in market discount rates ie  the market requires a greater risk premium and or interest rates rise  or a combination of both 
all changes in fair value for securities or derivatives accounted for as trading instruments flow through the income statement 
these adjustments can be either positive or negative from period to period 
the vast majority of real estate securities held by redwood and consolidated acacia entities at december  were accounted for as available for sale afs securities 
we carry afs securities in our gaap balance sheet at their fair value 
positive changes in the fair value of afs securities from period to period are always accounted for as increases to stockholders equity and do not flow through our income statement 
accounting for negative changes in the fair value of afs securities from period to period requires a three step process involving a combination of quantitative and judgmental evaluations 
the ultimate purpose of this process is to determine whether negative mtm adjustments represent other than temporary ott impairments  which flow through our gaap income statement  or represent temporary impairments  which are recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity and do not flow through our income statement 

table of contents the diagram below and the narrative discussion that follow addresses the three step process for evaluating impairments on afs securities 

graphic missing 
the first step in this process is to determine whether there has been an adverse change in the underlying cash flows generated by the security 
a security is considered ott impaired even if the change in projected cash flows is small relative to the resulting mtm adjustment 
it is difficult to separate with precision how much of the change in fair value is driven by changes in expected cash flows versus changes in market discount rates  but during periods of market illiquidity and uncertainty as we encountered in late  the market discount rate impact can be significant 
the second step is to determine whether we have the ability and intention to hold the security 
the third step requires us to evaluate whether an impaired security will recover in value within a reasonable period of time 
this step is very subjective and proved especially difficult this quarter in light of turmoil and uncertainty in the capital markets 
we needed additional time to complete this step  and thus we requested a fifteen day extension of the filing date of our annual report on form k 
over of the total ott impairments we recorded during the fourth quarter resulted from this third step of the process 
afs securities deemed ott impaired for accounting purposes cannot be written back up through mtm adjustments in our income statement 
this does not mean the underlying security could not recover in value 
if the value of an impaired security does recover  we would recognize this benefit through higher interest yields over time 
therefore  some of our securities which were classified as ott impaired for accounting purposes during may eventually prove to have significant economic value to us 
we believe the mtm accounting rules applicable to the preparation of our financial statements caused our stockholders equity to be significantly understated at december  we are required for accounting purposes to consolidate the acacia cdo entities 
as a result  the net gaap carrying value of our investments in acacia reflected in our financial statements is expressed as the difference between the carrying value of acacia s assets and the carrying value of acacia s liabilities abs issued to third parties 
the mtm 
table of contents accounting rules in place at december   required us to mtm acacia s assets  but did not permit us to mtm acacia s liabilities  even though the assets and liabilities are directly paired ie  the liabilities of an acacia entity will be repaid only from the cash flows generated by that entity s assets 
consequently  the gaap net carrying value of our investments in acacia entities was negative billion at december   a value that is impossible as the economic value of our investments cannot be less than zero and significantly understates our estimate of the economic value of our acacia investments at that time 
in our opinion  the best economic method to assess the value of our investments in acacia is to calculate the net present value of future expected cash flows of these investments 
our december  estimate of the sum of future expected cash flows from our investments in acacia securities plus management fees we anticipate receiving from those entities was million 
the net present value of these cash flows discounted at was million 
we believe that million is a reasonable approximation of the economic value of our investments in acacia at december  if we were permitted for accounting purposes to use the valuation methodology described above  gaap and economics would be in sync  and our financial statements and disclosures would be less complicated 
on january   we adopted fas and elected to fair value both the assets and liabilities of the acacia entities 
in accordance with fas  we recorded a one time  cumulative effect adjustment to our balance sheet that decreased the carrying value of acacia liabilities by billion and increased stockholders equity by that amount in our january  balance sheet 
adoption of this new accounting standard significantly improves the substantial disparity that existed between the acacia gaap presentation and economics at december  discrepancies between economic and gaap valuations of our acacia investments will continue to occur because under fas the cash flow value of our investments is not taken into account in determining the carrying value of our investments 
instead  gaap carrying value of our investments is derived by subtracting the fair value of acacia s liabilities from the fair value of acacia s assets 
furthermore  acacia s assets and liabilities are valued separately in their independent markets 
in theory  changes in the fair values of acacia s assets and liabilities should be reasonably correlated as they are paired within the same legal structure abs issued by each acacia entity will be repaid directly and solely from the cash flows generated by the assets owned by that entity 
however  at any given moment  the capital markets may use different discount rates and valuation parameters for acacia s collateral assets relative to its abs issued to third parties 
on january   for instance  the market values for acacia liabilities were  in our view  depressed relative to the paired collateral asset values 
as a consequence of this market condition  when we fair valued the assets and liabilities of the acacia entities under fas at january   the derived net gaap carrying value of our acacia investments was million 
this result exceeded our million estimate of economic value of our investments in acacia entities based on the net present value of expected cash flows 
as a consequence of adopting fas  we will be required in the future to flow through our quarterly income statements the relative changes in the fair values of acacia assets and liabilities as measured in their independent markets 
there is no way to anticipate these relative changes from quarter to quarter 
as a consequence  our earnings will vary as these values fluctuate over time 
in particular  if acacia liability values increase from the low levels at december   all or a portion of the million by which the gaap carrying value at january  million exceeded our estimate of economic value million will flow through our income statement as negative mtm adjustments 
there is no scheduled time frame when this excess may be absorbed 
it could happen gradually over time  or it could happen in a single quarter 
impact on redwood the price declines in real estate securities in had a significant negative gaap financial reporting impact on redwood  as mtm adjustments to our consolidated real estate securities portfolio caused our gaap book value and our gaap earnings to decline significantly 
as previously discussed  we believe the real economic effect of these mtm adjustments is significantly less than the impact shown under gaap as a consequence of being required to mtm acacia assets  but not being permitted to mtm the paired acacia liabilities

the total stockholders equity impact of million for the year ended december  agrees with our consolidated balance sheet for the year 
the total income statement impact of billion for the year ended december  agrees with our consolidated income statement for the year

we recorded a one time cumulative adjustment to our opening balance for to reduce the carrying value of acacia s liabilities by billion 
after giving effect to this adjustment  the net mtm impact for was negative million 
this impact is substantially less than the billion reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
negative mtm adjustments on the securities at redwood that were reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity at december  that is  gross unrealized losses that have not flowed through our income statement were million for residential ces and million for commercial ces 
if credit conditions continue to deteriorate in  causing an adverse change in the expected cash flows from these securities  we could be required to flow through our income statement an impairment charge for a portion or for all of these negative mtm adjustments 
it is important to note that those impairment charges would not impact our book value as the mtm adjustments were already deducted from stockholders equity at december   but they would reduce our gaap earnings in mark to market valuation process the fair values we use in our mark to market process reflect what we believe we would realize if we chose to sell our securities or would have to pay if we chose to buy back our asset backed securities abs issued liabilities 
establishing fair values is inherently subjective and is dependent upon many market based inputs  including observable trades  information on offered inventories  bid lists  and indications of value obtained from dealers 
valuations are especially difficult for more illiquid securities  such as the securities we own and our abs issued  and when there is limited trading visibility  as was the case in recent months 
for these reasons  we expect market valuations to continue to be highly volatile 
fair values for the securities we own and our abs issued are dependent upon a number of market based assumptions including future interest rates  prepayment rates  discount rates  credit loss rates  and the timing of credit losses 
we then use these assumptions to generate cash flow estimates and internal values for each individual security 

table of contents we request indications of value marks from dealers every quarter to assist in the valuation process 
for december   we received dealer marks on of the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and did not receive marks for the remaining 
one of the factors we consider in our valuation process is our assessment of the quality of the dealer marks we receive 
dealers were overwhelmed with requests for year end marks  and there was little observable trading information for them to rely upon 
thus  their marks were most likely generated by their own pricing models for which they did not share their inputs and we had little insight into their assumptions 
furthermore  the dealers now heavily qualify the information they send to us 
the qualifications include the following credit markets have been characterized by significant volatility and very limited liquidity  the sharp downturn in trading levels for many securities has resulted in poor price transparency  valuations have become especially dependent on assumptions used in valuation models rather than observable inputs  valuations are indicative only and may not reflect the actual prices or spread levels at which the securities could be sold  and valuations do not necessarily reflect the values that would be produced by other pricing models or methods 
our valuation process relied on our internal values to estimate the fair values of our securities at december  in the aggregate  our internal valuations of the securities on which we received dealer marks were million  or  lower than the aggregate dealer marks at december  our internal valuations of our abs issued on which we received dealer marks were million  or less than  lower than the aggregate dealer marks at december

year ended december  yield as a result of dollars in thousands interest income net premium discount amortization reversal of provision for credit losses total interest income average amortized cost interest income premium discount amortization and credit provision total interest income residential loans    commercial loans   total loans    residential real estate loans total interest income on residential real estate loans decreased to million for from million for this was primarily a result of lower average balances of residential real estate loans and increased credit provisions in relative to our residential real estate loan balance decreased to billion at december  from billion at december   as our loans paid down and we had a relatively low level of loan acquisitions 
of the billion of residential loans outstanding at december   consisted of one or six month libor adjustable rate residential loans libor arms 
the level of short term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve have an impact on the prepayment performance of libor arm loans 
as the yield curve flattened and short term interest rates rose beginning in early  prepayments on these loans accelerated and  until recently  have generally prepaid at relatively fast speeds 
in the second half of  as the yield curve steepened and short term interest rates began to fall  prepayments on libor arm loans slowed considerably 
the average constant prepayment rate cpr for our libor arms was in the year ended december   in the year ended december   and on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter of loan premium amortization expense was million for and million for on a percentage basis  loan premium amortization expense for our libor arms continues to lag the rate of decrease in our libor arm residential loan balance 
the reason for this anomaly relates to the loan premium amortization method we use for loans acquired prior to july  which represented of the loan balance at december  for these loans  the premium amortization rate is somewhat influenced by prepayments  but is also influenced by short term interest rates 
as short term rates increase  premium amortization slows  as short term rates decrease  premium amortization potentially accelerates in a material way 
see the potential for gaap earnings volatility below for further discussion 
for the remainder of the loans those acquired after july  we use a different accounting method for premium amortization  where the percentage of amortization is more closely correlated to prepayment rates regardless of changes in short term interest rates 
in  we increased our provision for credit losses for residential loans by million 
in  we reduced our provision for credit losses for residential loans by less than million 
as the residential loans on our consolidated balance sheet season and we do not acquire many new loans  we would expect to increase our credit reserve on a percentage basis  as we would expect our delinquencies to rise 
on a percentage basis  our credit reserve increased to of the residential loan balance at december  from at december  serious delinquencies defined as those loans that are days or more delinquent  in foreclosure or real estate owned in residential loans have increased from of the current loan balance at december  to at december  as a percentage of original balance  serious delinquencies increased from at december  to at december  
table of contents commercial real estate loans interest income on commercial real estate loans decreased by million for compared to the previous year 
the majority of the decrease related to fully reserving for an anticipated loss on a mezzanine commercial loan financing a condominium conversion project during the first quarter of cost over runs and changing market conditions make it probable that we will not collect any outstanding principal or accrued interest upon completion of the project 
the total charge off for this loan was million  of which million related to principal and taken through the credit provision and million to accrued interest and taken as a reduction in interest income

table of contents investment grade securities interest income from igs increased to million in as compared to million in  due primarily higher average balances of igs in the majority of the igs we acquired over the past year were residential  in part because comparably rated commercial securities traded at relatively higher prices and lower yields 
the overall yield on our igs portfolio increased during the year  reflecting increasing coupon rates on the underlying loans 
the decrease in yields on commercial igs in relative to was due to the sale of commercial ios in owned by earlier acacia entities 
residential credit enhancement securities we acquire many first loss securities at to of their principal value and other  more senior  credit enhancement securities at to of their principal value 
many of these securities are priced at a substantial discount to their principal value since future credit losses could reduce or eliminate the principal value of these securities 
our yields on these investments depend on how much principal and interest we eventually collect and how quickly we receive those payments 
the faster we collect principal and the longer it takes to realize credit losses  the better it is for our investment returns 
interest income from our residential ces was million for  a million increase over this increase is the result of higher yields and higher average balances 
most of our residential ces portfolio is backed by loans originated in and earlier 
the credit performance on these loans has generally been better than our initial expectations  and this has contributed to higher yields than anticipated 
faster than anticipated prepayment rates on adjustable rate mortgages arms have also contributed to higher levels of discount amortization 
arms represented by market value of our residential ces portfolio at december  and average actual prepayment rates were in excess of in compared to our initial expectations at the time of acquisition of to 
we own residential real estate securities that are backed by option arms that give the borrower the option of making a minimum payment that is less than the amount of interest owed for that loan period 
the unpaid interest is added to the loan balance creating negative amortization neg am 
the amount of neg am interest we currently recognize or defer for gaap purposes on option arm securities depends on our expectation of collectability 
we currently expect that accumulated neg am interest for securities rated bb and higher will be paid in full 
we currently do not expect to collect the neg am interest on our unrated and b rated securities 
as a result  in both and we recognized million of neg am interest on securities rated bb and higher 
during each of these time periods we deferred recognition of neg am interest of million on our unrated and b rated securities backed by option arms 
we will recognize any deferred interest on these securities only if and when cash is received 
our cumulative deferred neg am interest was million at december   an increase from million at december  commercial credit enhancement securities interest income from our commercial ces was million for  an million increase over this increase is primarily the result of significantly higher average balances 
the average yield earned on our commercial ces portfolio for was  an increase from for for both and  the yield was low relative to our other ces due to our credit loss assumptions 
similar to residential ces  commercial ces are acquired at a net discount 
commercial ces generally have a ten year maturity and are not expected to receive principal prepayments prior to maturity 
as a result  it will take several years to further observe credit performance and re assess our loss assumptions 
a decrease in projected credit loss assumptions would result in higher yields an increase in discount amortization while increased loss assumptions would lead to lower yields or impairments

interest expense on consolidated abs decreased by million to million in from million in the reduction in consolidated abs interest expense was caused by a decline in the average balance of outstanding consolidated abs issued as a result of prepayments of the loans within these securitization entities 
offsetting some of the decline in balances was the higher cost of funds due to an increase in short term interest rates during the first nine months of as most of our debt and consolidated abs issued is indexed to one  three  or six months libor 
these factors are illustrated in the volume and rate change table below 

table of contents interest expenses on redwood debt increased by million to million in from million in as a result of increased use of redwood debt primarily during the first half of the average balance of our outstanding redwood debt increased during due to a high level of financing for the acquisition of residential real estate loans and securities prior to the securitization of these assets through sequoia and acacia  including from calling some older sequoia loan securitizations and financing of aaa and aa rated real estate securities during the early part of the year

there was severance expense as part of a realignment of residential and commercial operations in and no such expense in fixed compensation expense includes employee salaries and related employee benefits 
our average headcount increased in over levels and combined with salary increases in accounts for the year over year increase in the fixed compensation 
variable compensation expense was significantly lower in variable compensation expense includes employee bonuses which are based on the annual adjusted return on equity earned by redwood and individual performance 
the adjusted return on equity was below that required for company performance bonuses  to be earned in equity compensation expense includes the cost of equity awards granted to employees and directors over the vesting period 
non compensation expenses were relatively the same in as in the ongoing office and system related costs were in line with our staffing growth 
these increases were offset by a decrease in due diligence expenses as our acquisition activity was lower in realized gains on sales and calls total realized gains on sales and calls were lower for compared to the primary reason was the fact that prices on securities fell throughout and  as a result  we did not choose to exercise our call rights on eligible acacia entities 
in  we called three acacias  sold the underlying assets and recognized gains after paying back the related debt 
early in  we called one acacia and generated some gains 
as prices on securities fell in the second half of  the liquidity in the market also became restricted 
early in the second half of  we decided to sell most of our aaa rated securities funded with debt and did so at a loss  further contributing to the disparity in net losses gains on sales between and in the second half of  we acquired a few acacia abs at discounts relative to the issued price

 accounting for certain hybrid financial investments fas in the first quarter of  we elected at the end of the first quarter to classify certain securities ios  nims  and residuals that contain embedded derivatives as trading instruments 
under previous gaap guidance  we had classified these securities as available for sale afs 
the fair value of these orei declined in by million as spreads widened considerably as a result of the dislocation of the residential mortgage backed securities market 

table of contents credit default swaps held in our acacia securitizations are derivatives and accounted for as trading instruments 
the fair value of these credit default swaps decreased million in as spreads widened out and prices fell on the underlying securities that these credit default swaps referenced 
the fair values of those interest rate agreements accounted for as trading instruments decreased by million during all changes in fair values  whether positive or negative  of these particular interest rate agreements are recognized through the income statement 
we use interest rate agreements to manage our interest rate risks 
the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability may not be reported through our income statement 
consequently  our use of interest rate agreements accounted for as trading instruments  could lead to volatile reported earnings even when they are accomplishing the goal of hedging some of our interest rate risks 
we recorded negative million of market valuation adjustments on our held for sale residential real estate loans during as these are reported on our balance sheet at the lower of cost of market locom 
once transferred from held for investment to held for sale the loans are required to be revalued quarterly and recorded at locom 
write downs to current market value once in the held for sale category are recorded through the income statement 
we had no held for sale loans during for accounting purposes  securities are deemed impaired if the fair value is below amortized cost 
an assessment is then required as to whether the impairment is temporary and is reflected as unrealized losses in the balance sheet  or is other than temporary and realized through the income statement as market valuation adjustments 
the assessment of other than temporary impairments requires a determination of whether there has been an adverse change in the underlying cash flows generated by a security  whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security  and whether we believe the impaired security will recover its value within a reasonable period of time 
this is a highly complex and subjective evaluation 
based on our assessment  we recorded billion of other than temporary impairments through our income statement in with billion of this amount recorded in the fourth quarter 
the majority of these fourth quarter impairments over were due to our assessment that the values of many types of securities would not recover within a reasonable period of time 
other comprehensive loss income most of our real estate securities are accounted for as afs and are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
many of our derivative instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges and are also reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
the differences between the value of these assets and our amortized cost are shown as a component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
periodic changes in the fair value of these assets relative to amortized cost are included in other comprehensive loss income 
as a result of the spread widening on real estate securities that occurred during  the fair value adjustments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet on afs assets was negative billion

taxes provisions for income taxes as a reit  we are able to pass through substantially all of our earnings generated at our reit to stockholders without paying income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on the reit taxable income we retain and on the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
our income tax provision in was million  a decrease from the million income tax provision recorded in  primarily due to a decline in net income  particularly at our taxable subsidiaries 
taxable income and dividends in  we earned an estimated million of total taxable income  or per share 
of this amount  million was earned at the reit and million was earned at our taxable subsidiaries 
total taxable income is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap  it is the pre tax income calculated for tax purposes 
reit taxable income is that portion of our taxable income that we earn at redwood trust and its qualifying reit subsidiaries and does not include taxable income earned in taxable subsidiaries 
estimated reit taxable income is an important measure as it is the basis of our required dividend distributions to stockholders 
taxable income calculations differ from gaap income calculations in a variety of ways 
the most significant differences include the timing of amortization of premium and discounts and the timing of the recognition of gains or losses on assets 
the rules for both gaap and tax accounting for loans and securities are technical and complicated and the impact of changing interest rates  actual and projected prepayment rates  and actual and projected credit losses can have a very different impact on the amount of gaap and tax income recognized in any one period 
see the discussions under potential gaap earnings volatility and potential tax earnings volatility below for further information on this topic 

table of contents total estimated taxable income of million was less than the million earned in by million 
this decrease was the result of an increase in credit losses on ces of million  million in write offs of interest only certificates resulting from the call of sequoia securitizations  million of losses on commercial assets  and lower gains of million from sales and calls 
these decreases were partially offset by lower equity compensation expenses of million in the table below reconciles gaap income to total taxable income for and table differences between gaap net income and total taxable income

to the extent such events do not occur  or other events occur which we have not anticipated  our quarterly estimates could change and could be significantly different quarter over quarter 
see the discussion in potential tax income volatility below 
our board of directors declared regular dividends of per share for each of the four quarters of and a special dividend of per share 
as in the past few years  we permanently retained of our taxable reit income and deferred the distribution of a portion of our taxable reit income to shareholders into the subsequent year 
at december   there was million per share of undistributed estimated reit taxable income that we plan to distribute to our shareholders during the first two quarters of we continue to be in compliance with all reit tests 
we generally attempt to avoid acquiring assets or structuring financings or sales at the reit that could generate unrelated business taxable income or excess inclusion income that would be distributed to our shareholders or that would cause prohibited transaction taxes on the reit 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
potential gaap earnings volatility we expect quarter to quarter gaap earnings volatility for a variety of reasons  including the timing of sales and calls of assets  changes in interest rates  prepayments  credit losses  changes in fair values of assets and liabilities  and capital utilization 
in addition  volatility may occur because of technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
loan premium amortization our unamortized loan premium on our consolidated residential real estate loans at december  was million 
this will be expensed over the remaining life of these loans 
amortization for a significant portion of this premium balance is driven by effective yield calculations that depend on interest rates and prepayments see critical accounting policies for further details 
loan premium amortization was million and million in and  respectively 
declines in short term interest rates and increases in prepayments could cause a significant increase in required amortization in subsequent periods 
in addition  premium amortization expense acceleration could occur if we reclassify a portion of the underlying loans from held for investment to held for sale  as the gaap carrying value of these loans is 
table of contents currently in excess of their fair value 
this reclassification could occur as the various underlying pools of loans become callable and we decide to sell these loans  or it could occur if there is a change in accounting principles 
changes in fair values on real estate securities currently  all of our igs and ces are classified as afs and are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values 
cumulative unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
however  adverse changes to projected cash flows related to poor credit performance  adverse changes to prepayment speeds  or our decision to sell assets could create an other than temporary impairment for accounting purposes and could cause declines in fair values to be reported through our income statement as market valuation adjustments 
at december  we had billion of securities on our consolidated balance sheet 
of these  million were backed by subprime loans million of ces and million of igs and million were backed by option arms million of prime ces  million of prime igs  million of alt a ces  and million alt a igs 
in the event future credit performance on our ces securities is worse than our current projections  we would be required to report losses through our income statement 
see the financial condition discussion later in this document for further detail on these securities 
as of january  we elected the fair value option under fas for the consolidated assets and liabilities of acacia 
see below for a discussion on the potential impact to gaap earnings of this election 
changes in fair values in other real estate investments other real estate investments ios  nims  and residuals typically contain embedded derivatives that require bifurcation and separate valuation through the income statement under fas we have elected to treat these investments as trading instruments rather than bifurcate the embedded derivative component 
trading instruments are required to be reported on our consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values with changes in fair values reported through our consolidated statements of income loss through market valuation adjustment 
marking to market the security rather than just the embedded derivative component will likely increase gaap earnings volatility going forward 
under previous gaap guidance  we classified these securities as afs 
we may classify other assets as trading instruments or may elect the fair value option under fas for certain of our future acquisitions see below 
changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments to date  we have elected two classifications for derivative instruments trading instruments and cash flow hedges 
all derivative instruments  regardless of classification  are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes to the fair values of the derivatives classified as trading instruments are recognized through the consolidated statements of income loss 
for those derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  the changes in fair values are reported through our consolidated balance sheets with only the ineffective portions as determined according to the accounting provisions reported through our income statement 
we could experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
this could occur  for example  when changes in the fair values of the derivatives are reported through our income statement but changes in the fair values in the hedged assets or liabilities are not recognized in a similar manner 
earnings volatility could also occur as we expand our use of derivatives including acquiring derivatives as investments and not just as hedging instruments 
changes in accounting principles as of january  we elected the fair value option for all assets  derivatives  and liabilities in acacia and we also plan to elect the fair value option for certain new acquisitions 
see the critical accounting policy section for a discussion of the potential impact of this election under fas these fair value option elections under fas could lead to further gaap volatility as we will now mark to market through the income statement each quarter all of the assets and liabilities of acacia and certain other assets and liabilities 
the market value of even paired assets and liabilities may not move in tandem in any one quarter 
thus  even if the liabilities can only be paid from the cash flows of the collateral assets as in the acacia securitization entities  we may report significant income or loss in a period 

table of contents potential tax income volatility taxable income may vary from quarter to quarter based on many reasons  three of which are discussed below 
credit losses to determine taxable income we are not permitted to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses 
taxable income can only be reduced when credit losses occur 
as a consequence  we are required to accrete the entire purchase discount on ces into taxable income over their expected life 
for gaap purposes  we do anticipate credit losses and only accrete a portion of the purchase discount into income 
additionally  for gaap we write down these securities when they become impaired 
as a result  our income recognition on ces is faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning the assets when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized costs basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo ces was million 
in addition  as of december   we had a credit reserve of million for gaap on our residential and commercial loans  and we recorded a million write down on a commercial loan for tax 
as of december   we had an million reserve for accrued interest on securities backed by option arms for gaap and no corresponding reserve on this income for tax 
as we have no credit reserves for tax and a higher ces basis  any future credit losses on our ces or loans would have a more significant impact on tax earnings as compared to gaap and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses varies during periods 
income recognition on sequoia interest only securities ios as a result of rapid prepayments  we are experiencing negative economic returns on some ios we acquired from prior sequoia securitizations 
for tax purposes  however  we are not permitted to recognize a negative yield  so premium amortization expenses for tax have not been as high as they otherwise would have been based on the economic returns 
as a result  our current tax basis of million on these ios is higher than the fair value 
many of our sequoia securitization entities are currently callable and others will become callable over the next two years 
depending on prevailing market conditions  we may call certain securitizations  at which time the io tax basis at that time will be written off and an ordinary loss for tax will be realized 
the actual losses will depend on the tax basis at the time of any calls as the monthly cash flows received on these ios in the interim will reduce their tax basis 
at this time  we do not anticipate calling any sequoia deals in our taxable earnings will vary from period to period based on the exact timing of these sequoia calls 
compensation expense compensation expense for tax varies depending on the timing of dividend equivalent rights payments  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units  and deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
for the most part  for gaap  the total expense associated with an award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period 
for tax  the expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise 
this leads to the possibility that the total expense related to equity awards could be significantly different for gaap than for tax in addition to the differences in timing 

table of contents results of operations vs 
our reported gaap net income was million per share for our gaap net income was million per share in and was million per share in our gaap return on equity was for compared to for and for in  we declared four regular quarterly dividends of per share and a special dividend of per share 
the largest factor in the decline in net income for as compared to was a million drop in income from gains generated on the sale and call of assets 
in  we sold a significant amount of ces as part of a portfolio management strategy to reduce our level of residential credit risk and to free up capital 
we also benefited from a large number of calls of securities in another factor contributing to the decline in earnings was a decrease in net interest income of million primarily due to high prepayments on adjustable rate loans securitized under our sequoia program 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in yields from our securities portfolio primarily residential ces 
other factors include an increase of operating expenses of million and an increase in negative mark to market valuation adjustments of million primarily related to interest rate agreements 
the assets associated with these interest rate agreements generally increased in value  but those increases were not recognized in gaap income 
these items were partially offset by a decrease in the tax provision of million due to a decrease in net income 
in  we raised million of capital through the sale of common stock via our direct stock purchase plan and we raised million of capital from the sale of trust preferred securities 
additionally  we freed up million of capital for investment by selling and re securitizing a portion of our ces 
we absorbed all of this capital in  primarily through new investments in commercial and residential ces and investment grade securities 
at year end  we had million of excess capital  million less than at the beginning of the year 
at year end  we had over billion of residential and commercial securities funded through our acacia cdo program

year ended december  yield as a result of dollars in thousands interest income net premium discount amortization reversal of provision for credit losses total interest income average amortized cost interest income premium discount amortization and credit provision total interest income residential loans    commercial loans   total loans    
table of contents interest income on real estate loans decreased to million in from million in primarily as a result of lower average balances of real estate loans 
this was due to high prepayments within our existing portfolio of libor indexed arms and a relatively low level of new loan acquisitions in this decline was partially offset by increased yields due to increases in the short term interest rates to which most of the residential real estate loans are indexed 
our residential real estate loan balance was billion at december   billion at december   and billion at december  the vast majority of these loans were one and six month libor adjustable rate residential loans libor arms that were financed through our sequoia securitization program 
the flattening of the yield curve that began in and continued through led to fast prepayments on our existing libor arms and caused origination levels of new libor arms to significantly decline 
in a flat yield curve environment  hybrid or fixed rate loans are a more attractive loan alternative 
additionally  new forms of adjustable rate mortgages negative amortization  option arms  and moving treasury average arms represent an increased share of the arm market 
prepayment rates for our residential loans increased from an average constant prepayment rate cpr of in to an average cpr of in loan premium amortization expense increased to million in from million in the percentage increase in premium amortization expense was not commensurate with the decrease in our residential loan balance during this period 
the reason for this anomaly relates to the loan premium amortization method we use for loans acquired prior to july  which represented of the loan balance at december  and of the loan balance at december  for these loans  the premium amortization rate is somewhat influenced by prepayments  but is more significantly influenced by short term interest rates 
as short term rates increase  premium amortization slows  as short term rates decrease  premium amortization could accelerate in a material way 
see the potential for gaap earnings volatility discussion later in this document 
for the remainder of the loans which we acquired after july  we use a different accounting method for premium amortization  and as a result  the percentage of amortization is more closely correlated to prepayment rates 
during  we reversed million of our existing loan credit reserve into income 
on a percentage basis  the reduction in the credit reserve was lower than the overall decline in our outstanding residential loan balance 
the primary reason was a rise in residential loan delinquencies  which increased from of the current loan balance at december  to at december  this increase in delinquencies is in line with our expectations as our loan portfolio seasons 
delinquencies as a percent of original balances increased from at december  to at december  overall  residential loan credit performance remains significantly better than our original expectations

interest income from igs increased in as compared to due to portfolio growth and increased yields 
the majority of the igs acquired in were residential  in part because comparably rated commercial securities traded at relatively higher prices and lower yields 
the increase in yield is generally reflective of the rise in short term interest rates over the past year  as new securities were purchased in a higher interest rate environment and many existing securities have a variable interest rate that reset to higher levels 
most of the igs acquired in were financed through our acacia cdo securitization program 
residential ces we acquire many first loss bonds at to of their principal value and other  more senior  credit enhancement securities at to of their principal value 
many of these securities are priced at a substantial discount to their principal value as future credit losses could reduce or eliminate the principal value of these securities 
our yields on these investments depend on how much principal and interest we eventually collect and how quickly we receive those payments 
the faster we collect principal and the longer it takes to realize credit losses  the better it is for our investment returns 
interest income from our residential ces was million in  a million increase over this increase is largely the result of higher yields in vs 
in  which resulted from the 
table of contents strong credit performance and faster than anticipated prepayments rates on ces on the underlying arms loans 
arms represented of our residential ces portfolio  and average actual prepayment rates were in excess of in compared to our initial expectations at the time of acquisition of to 
the increase in interest income also resulted from a higher average balance of residential ces in our portfolio 
this growth reflected our ability to find new assets at a pace in excess of our sales  calls  and principal payments 
igs and ces backed by option arms we own igs and ces that are backed by option arm mortgages  which give the borrower the option of making a minimum payment that is less than the amount of interest owed for that loan period 
the unpaid interest is added to the loan balance creating negative amortization neg am 
the amount of neg am interest we currently recognize or defer for gaap purposes on option arms securities depends on our expectation of collectability 
we currently expect that accumulated neg am interest for securities rated bb and higher will be paid in full 
we will continue to monitor and assess this assumption 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of neg am interest on securities rated bb and higher 
during these same time periods  we deferred recognition of neg am interest of million and million  respectively  on our unrated and b rated securities 
for these securities we will recognize this deferred interest as cash is received 
our cumulative deferred neg am interest is million at december  commercial ces interest income from our commercial ces was million in  a million increase over this increase is almost entirely the result of higher average balances 
we were active buyers of commercial ces in as we have become more established in this marketplace 
the average yield earned on our commercial ces portfolio in was 
the yield was low relative to other ces due to credit loss assumptions 
similar to residential  commercial ces are acquired at a net discount 
commercial ces generally have a ten year maturity and are not expected to receive principal prepayments prior to maturity 
as a result  it will take several years to reasonably assess credit performance and recognize any potential upside in yield from discount amortization 
interest income cash and cash equivalents interest income from cash and cash equivalents was million in  a million increase over this increase is largely the result of higher average excess cash balances and an increase in yield earned on cash

these include write downs of assets that are impaired under the provisions of eitf impairments are generally caused by an adverse change in projected cash flows in conjunction with a decrease in the fair value 
there is no reversal of this impairment on assets  even if projected cash flows improve in the future 
the fair value changes of those interest rate agreements accounted for as trading are also included in valuation adjustment 
all changes  whether positive or negative  of these particular interest rate agreements are recognized through the income statement 
we use interest rate agreements to manage our interest rate risks  and the changes in the value of the hedged asset or liability is not included in the valuation adjustment 
thus  our use of interest rate agreements accounted for as trading instruments could lead to volatile reported earnings even when they are accomplishing the goal of hedging some of our interest rate risks 
changes in fair values of our loan purchase commitments are reflected in our income statement

total taxable income per share for the year is the sum of the four quarters total taxable income per share 
total taxable income in of million per share decreased from the million per share earned in one reason for this decrease was a reduction in gains on sales and calls of assets 
for tax purposes  we realized million of gains in  a decrease from the million of gains realized in another reason was the increase in operating expense in of million  which was primarily the result of the timing of the exercise of stock options and the distributions of other equity awards 
operating expenses increased as well due to increases in staffing in 
table of contents partially offsetting the decrease in net gains and the increase in operating expense was a million increase in net interest income as calculated for tax purposes in continued strong credit performance  fast prepayments  and rising short term interest rates all contributed to increased net yields on our portfolios 
for tax purposes  our yields on our residential  commercial  and cdo ces are higher than for gaap  primarily due to the difference in timing of amortizing the discount into income 
in  we amortized million more discount into income on our ces portfolios for tax purposes than for gaap purposes 
as a result  at december  the tax basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo ces was million higher than the gaap basis 
the other contributor to the increase in net interest income as calculated for tax was tax accounting for ios 
given the fast prepayments on the underlying loans in  the yield we would currently recognize on these ios would be negative if accounted for based on economics 
for tax purposes  however  we cannot recognize a negative yield  and  thus  we are not amortizing the premium on these ios as quickly as the fast prepayments would indicate 
we are recognizing a zero yield for tax  not a negative yield as would otherwise be indicated 
as a result  our taxable income in was higher by million than it would have been otherwise cumulatively the difference is million 
our taxable income over the next few years will be lower than it would have been otherwise by this same amount

a our actual sequoia investments consist of ces  igs  and io securities acquired by redwood from the sequoia entities 
we calculated the million estimate of economic value for these securities using the same mtm valuation process that we followed to fair value all other real estate securities 
in contrast  the million of gaap carrying value of these investments represents the difference between residential real estate loans owned by the sequoia entities and the asset backed securities abs issued by those entities to third party investors 
we account for these loans and abs issued at cost  not at fair value 
gaap carrying value is million higher than our estimate of economic value primarily because the accounting method we use to amortize a portion of our loan acquisition premiums has not kept pace with loan prepayments 
b our actual acacia investments consist of equity interests  and to a lesser extent abs issued  that we acquired from the acacia entities 
the million estimate of economic value of our investment interests in the acacia entities at december  represents the net present value of projected cash flows from our acacia investments and management fees discounted at 
in contrast  the negative billion and million of gaap carrying values of our acacia investments at december  and january   respectively  represent the difference between the securities owned by the acacia entities and abs issued by the acacia entities to third party investors 
the reason for the difference between economic and gaap carrying values is complex and relates to a significant difference in valuation methodology 
this difference is discussed in detail in the mark to market adjustments discussion in this document 
c we issued million of year subordinated notes trust preferred securities or trups at an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
under gaap  the trups are carried at cost at both december  and january  economic value is difficult to estimate with precision as the trups market is currently inactive 
we calculated the million estimate of economic value using the same mtm valuation process used to fair value our other financial liabilities 
estimated economic value is million lower than our gaap carrying value because given the significant overall contraction in credit availability and re pricing of credit risk  if we had issued these subordinated notes at december   investors would have required a substantially higher interest rate

residential real estate loans we acquire high quality residential real estate loans on a bulk or flow basis from originators 
prior to  these loan purchases were predominately comprised of short reset libor indexed arms libor arms 
since then  we have expanded our residential conduit s product offerings to include high quality hybrid loans loans with a fixed rate coupon for a period of two to ten years before becoming adjustable

residential credit enhancement securities the largest part of our business in terms of capital employed is investing in residential ces 
these credit enhancement securities have credit ratings that are below investment grade and have both the upside opportunities and downside risks that come from taking on concentrated credit risks 
our residential ces portfolio had a fair value of million at december  and million at december  as a result of the concentrated credit risk associated with residential loan ces  we are generally able to acquire these securities at a discount to their face principal value 
at december   the difference between the principal value billion and carrying value million which equals fair value of these residential loan ces was billion 
of this difference  million was designated as internal credit reserve reflecting our estimate of credit losses on the underlying loans over the life of these securities  million represented unamortized discount we are accreting into income over time  and million represented net unrealized mark to market losses 
amortized cost principal value less internal credit reserve less amortized discount decreased million from million at december  to million at december  as acquisitions  discount amortization  and transfers of securities from other portfolios exceeded pay downs and sales

december  rating in millions bb b unrated total prime alt a subprime total residential ces prime securities are residential mortgage backed securities backed primarily by high credit quality loans 
many of the loans are jumbos  with loan balances greater than existing conforming loan limits 
prime securities typically have relatively high weighted average fico scores or higher  low or less  weighted average loan to value ratios ltv  and limited concentrations of investor properties 
alt a securities are residential mortgage backed securities that have higher credit quality than subprime and lower credit quality than prime 
alt a originally represented loans with alternative documentation  but has shifted over time to include loans with additional risk characteristics and a higher percentage of investor loans 
borrower s income may not be verified  and in some cases  may not be disclosed on the loan application 
expanded criteria also allows for higher debt to income ratios with higher accompanying ltv than otherwise would be permissible for prime loans 
subprime securities are residential mortgage backed securities backed by loans to borrowers who have impaired credit histories  but who appear to exhibit the ability to repay the current loan 
typically  these 
table of contents borrowers have lower credit scores or other credit deficiencies that prevent them from qualifying for prime or alt a mortgages 
to compensate for the greater risks and higher costs to service these loans  subprime borrowers pay higher interest rates  points  and origination fees 
when evaluating the acquisition of ces backed by subprime loans  we use loss assumptions that are significantly higher than those we use for prime loans

as a result  our return on equity may increase after securitization 
in addition  liquidity risks are generally reduced or eliminated  as the redwood debt associated with the accumulation of these assets during their accumulation is paid off upon securitization 
subordinated notes in  we issued million of subordinated notes trust preferred securities through redwood capital trust i  a wholly owned delaware statutory trust  in a private placement transaction

derivative financial instruments we currently have three kinds of derivative instruments  interest rate agreements  commitments to purchase  and credit default swaps 
all derivatives are reported on our balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are either recorded through our consolidated statements of income loss or through accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
we enter into interest rate agreements to help manage some of our interest rate risks 
we enter into these agreements with highly rated counterparties and maintain certain risk management policies limiting our exposure concentrations to any counterparty

purchase commitments have zero value at the date of the commitment so any subsequent changes in value are recognized through our income statements 
once the loans are purchased  the value of the purchase commitment adjusts our cost basis in the loans 

table of contents we entered into our first credit default swaps in the first quarter of at december  we had a million notional balance worth negative million 
the swaps have zero value at purchase  so the entire decrease in value was recognized through our income statement during stockholders equity our reported book value at december  was negative per share  a decrease from per share at the beginning of the year 
our book value per share decreased over this period primarily as a result of declines in the fair value of the assets consolidated on our balance sheets

other sources of cash include proceeds from sales of assets to securitizations entities  proceeds from sales of other assets  proceeds from calls of securities  borrowings  and issuance of equity and debt 
we fund our riskiest credit investments with equity capital and limited the use of recourse financial leverage  especially when the macroeconomic risks facing our business are high

our rate of excess capital utilization will depend on future market conditions  but will be grounded in strong balance sheet management 
we plan to ensure capital adequacy through the duration of the current market dislocation and beyond  which requires maintaining enough excess capital to account for changing market conditions 
while we anticipate using excess capital to grow our franchise and make good long term investments  redwood s board of directors has authorized us to purchase up to five million shares of our common stock if we believe our shares are trading at attractive levels relative to other uses of cash

table of contents market risks we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  and fair value risk in a prudent manner designed to enhance our earnings and dividends and preserve our capital 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
credit risk integral to our core business is assuming the credit risk of real estate loans primarily through the ownership of residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
much of our capital base is employed in owning credit enhancement securities that have below investment grade credit ratings due to their concentrated credit risks with respect to underlying real estate loans 
we believe that many of the loans underlying these securities are above average in credit quality as compared to us real estate loans in general  but the balance and percentage of loans with special risk factors higher risk commercial loans  interest only and negative amortization residential loan types  and alt a and subprime residential loans has increased and continue to increase 
we also own a wide variety of residential and commercial real estate loans of various quality grades that are not securitized 
credit losses from any of the loans in securitized loan pools reduce the principal value of and economic returns on the lower rated securities in these pools 
credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens  our credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
credit losses on real estate loans can vary for reasons not related to the general economy 
with respect to most of the loans securitized by securitization entities sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan ces we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others  the interest rate is adjustable 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners may rise under the terms of these arms  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
we also acquire credit enhancement securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to residential borrowers  some of which are prime quality loans while many are alt a quality loans and a few are subprime loans 
we invest in these riskier loan types with the expectation of significantly higher delinquencies and losses as compared to regular amortization loans  but believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of attractive pricing and the manner in which these securitizations are structured 
nevertheless  there remains substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 
the large majority of the commercial loans we credit enhance are fixed rate loans  some of which are interest only loans 
in general  these loans are not fully amortizing and therefore require balloon payments at maturity 
consequently  we could be exposed to credit losses at the maturity of these loans if the borrower is unable to repay or refinance the borrowing with another third party lender 
we will experience credit losses on residential and commercial loans and ces  and to the extent the losses are consistent with the amount and timing of our assumptions  we expect to earn attractive returns on our investments 
we manage our credit risks by understanding the extent of the risk we are taking and insuring the appropriate underwriting criteria are met  and we utilize systems and staff to continually monitor the ongoing credit performance of each loan and security 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific assets are changing adversely  we will take actions including selling the assets to mitigate potential losses 
however  we may not always be successful in foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses 

table of contents in addition to residential and commercial ces  the acacia entities we sponsor own investment grade and other securities issued by securitization entities that are sponsored by others 
these securities are typically rated aaa through b  and are in a second loss or better position or are otherwise effectively more senior in the credit structure in comparison to first loss ces or their equivalent 
a risk we face with respect to these securities is that we do not generally control or influence the underwriting  servicing  management  or loss mitigation with respect to these underlying loans 
the acacia entities also own securities backed by subprime and alt a residential loans that have substantially higher credit risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
consequently  we can expect these lower quality loans to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and if such losses differ from our assumptions  acacia and thus redwood could suffer losses 
in addition to the foregoing  the acacia entities own certain investment grade  bb rated  and b rated residential loan securities purchased from the sequoia securitization entities we sponsor 
these securities owned by acacia are generally less likely to suffer credit losses than other securities since credit losses ordinarily would not occur until cumulative credit losses within the pool of securitized loans exceed the principal value of the subordinated ces underneath and other credit protections have been exhausted 
however  if the pools of residential and commercial loans underlying these securities were to experience poor credit results  these acacia securities could have their credit ratings downgraded  could suffer decreases in fair value  or could experience principal losses 
if any of these events occurs  it would likely reduce our returns from the acacia cdo equity securities we have acquired and may reduce our ability to sponsor acacia transactions in the future 
interest rate risk interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and fair values of our assets  liabilities  and interest rate agreements  and consequently  affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to such a degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we are willing to accept short term volatility of earnings and changes in our reported equity in order to accomplish our goal of achieving attractive long term returns 
to implement our interest rate risk strategy  we may use interest rate agreements in an effort to maintain a close match between pledged assets and redwood debt  as well as between the interest rate characteristics of the assets in the securitization entities and the corresponding abs issued 
however  we do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates  and at times  we may be subject to more interest rate risk than we generally desire in the long term 
changes in interest rates will have an impact on the values and cash flows of our assets and corresponding liabilities 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount and through triggering market valuation adjustments 
for example  amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expense from premium assets  and vice versa 
in addition  variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in interest rates as they affect projected coupons on arms and other assets and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
moreover  the timing of premium amortization on assets may not always match the timing of the premium amortization on liabilities even when the underlying assets and liabilities are in the same securitization and pay down at the same rate 
with respect to securities backed by residential mortgage loans and in particular  io securities  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market prices of those securities sold by securitization entities  and thus could affect the profits we earn from securitized assets 

table of contents prepayment risks also exist in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities such as ces benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as io securities benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
our largest current potential exposure to changes in prepayment rates is on short term residential arm loans 
we are currently biased in favor of faster prepayment speeds with respect to the long term economic effect of arm prepayments 
however  in the short term  increases in arm prepayment rates could result in gaap earnings volatility 
through our ownership of discount residential loan ces backed by fixed rate and hybrid residential loans  we generally benefit from faster prepayments on those underlying loans 
prepayment rates for those loans typically accelerate as medium and long term interest rates decline 
our credit results and risks can also be affected by prepayments 
for example  credit risks for the ces we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates should reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
we caution that prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate  and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividends 
arm prepayment rates  for example  are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
we do not believe it is possible or desirable to control the effects of prepayments in the short term 
consequently  our general approach is to seek to balance overall characteristics of our balance sheet so that the net present values of cash flows generated over the life of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated portfolios do not materially change as prepayment rates change 
fair value and liquidity risks the consolidated securities are accounted for as available for sale and are generally marked to market through our balance sheets and not through our income statement 
these assets are credit and interest rate sensitive 
fair value fluctuations of these assets can affect reported stockholders equity 
most of these securities are owned by securitization entities we sponsor and fair value fluctuations on these securities do not have an impact on our liquidity 
fair value fluctuations on securities we own and fund with short term debt generally prior to securitization could have an impact on our liquidity 
our earnings could be affected by adverse changes in fair values on all securities we own or consolidate to the extent there is an accompanying adverse change in projected cash flows 
in these cases  the negative changes in fair values are reported through our income statement 
see also mark to market adjustments discussion earlier in this document 
beginning in the first quarter of  we classified other real estate investments as trading instruments 
changes in the fair values of these investments are recognized through our income statement 
thus  changes in fair values may add to the quarterly volatility of our earnings 
this could occur whether these instruments are hedged or are financed with non recourse debt 
most of our consolidated real estate loans are accounted for as held for investment and reported at amortized cost 
most of these loans have been sold to sequoia entities and  thus  changes in the fair value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair values during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with redwood debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we may own some real estate loans accounted for as held for sale and adverse changes in their value would be recognized through our income statement and may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for them 
our consolidated obligations consist primarily of abs issued 
for and prior periods these were reported at amortized cost 
generally  changes in fair value of abs issued have no impact on our liquidity 
however  because many of our consolidated assets funded with abs issued are reported at fair value  the resulting reported net equity may not necessarily reflect the true net fair value of assets and liabilities in these securitization entities 
specifically  we mark to market most of the assets and derivatives owned by the acacia entities  but none of acacia s liabilities 
if fair values for acacia s assets declined sufficiently  we could be required to record balance sheet charges in excess of the total maximum economic amount that redwood actually has invested 
conversely  we would not be able to reflect an offsetting improvement in acacia 
table of contents liability fair value changes in our consolidated financial statements 
these fair value changes may not affect the cash flows we expect to earn from our acacia investments  however 
on january  we elected the fair value option for certain assets and liabilities under fas now for these assets and liabilities  changes in market values will be recorded through our income statement  and it is likely to add to our earnings volatility 
most of these assets and liabilities accounted for in this manner are owned or issued by acacia and they will have no impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in values or ratings downgrades on assets owned by an acacia entity may disrupt the cash flows on certain of our investments in acacia 
such disruptions in cash flow may create additional differences between reported gaap and taxable income from cash received 
we do not currently believe that this will create any liquidity issues for us 
we hold some assets funded with short term debt that is recourse to redwood 
at some point  this may increase our fair value and liquidity risks 
we manage these risks by maintaining what we believe to be conservative capital levels under our internal risk adjusted capital and risk management policies and by ensuring we have a variety of financing facilities available to fund each of our assets 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies and the possible effect of changes in estimates on our financial results and statements are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition when recognizing revenue on consolidated earning assets  we employ the effective yield method and use assumptions about the future to determine an effective yield that drives amortization of premiums  discounts  and other net capitalized fees and costs associated with purchasing and financing real estate loans and securities 
loan premium amortization for consolidated real estate loans  the effective yield method is applied as prescribed under fas for loans acquired prior to july  we apply the existing interest rate at the reporting date rate to determine the effective yield for each pool of loans 
during a period of rising short term rates  the coupon is projected to increase  resulting in a higher effective yield 
under those circumstances  prior to the coupon rate resetting generally one to six months for these loans  the amount of amortization is lower than it will be once the coupon rate resets 
consequently as short term rates increased beginning in and through the first half of  the amount of premium we amortized was less than it would have been in a flat interest rate environment 
with lower premium amortization expenses as a result of rising interest rates combined with rapid prepayments  our cost bases have increased on our remaining loans 
the cost bases in these loans continues to exceed their estimated fair values 
for loans acquired after july   we use the initial coupon interest rate of the loans without regard to future changes in the underlying indices and anticipated principal payments on a pool basis to calculate an effective yield and to amortize the premium or discount 
any volatility in amortization expense is dependent primarily on prepayments 
the cost bases of these loans are approximately equal to their fair values 

table of contents securities discount amortization for discount amortization on our consolidated securities  an effective yield is applied by projecting cash flows that incorporate assumptions of credit losses  prepayment speeds  and interest rates over the remaining life of each asset 
if our assumptions prove to be accurate  then the yield that we recognize in the current period will remain the same over the life of the security 
we constantly review and update as necessary our assumptions and resulting cash flow projections based on historical performance  input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows will prove to be accurate or that these estimates will not change materially 
the majority of our discount amortization is generated from residential and commercial ces purchased at a significant discount to par value 
discount balances equal to the credit losses that we expect to incur are set aside as a form of credit reserve and are not amortized into income 
the level of this reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors including economic conditions  characteristics and delinquency status of the underlying loans  past performance of similar loans  and other factors 
thus  when credit losses do occur  they are recorded against this reserve and there is no income statement impact at that time 
the difference between the amount of our total discount and the credit reserve is the accretable discount 
the accretable discount represents the amount of discount amortization that we expect to recognize into income over the remaining life of the assets 
as we update our estimate of future credit losses  increases in projected losses will increase the discount set aside as reserve resulting in less accretable discount for amortization into income and lower portfolio yields 
in contrast  lower credit loss projections will decrease the reserve and increase the accretable discount balance  increasing our ces discount amortization and resulting in higher portfolio yields 
the timing of projected receipt of cash flows from our ces is also an important driver in the effective yield 
slower actual or projected prepayment speeds will cause projected receipt of cash flows to be delayed and will reduce the rate of ces discount accretion resulting in a lower yield for the portfolio 
an increase in actual or projected prepayment speeds will generally result in a higher portfolio yield as a result of increased ces discount amortization 
amortization of abs issued premium we apply the effective yield method in determining amortization for the premium and deferred asset backed securities issuance cost for abs issued 
abs premium is recognized through our income statement as a reduction in interest expense and under apb issuance costs are amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the abs issued 
similar to our calculation of amortization on assets  the use of this method requires us to project cash flows over the remaining life of each liability 
these projections are primarily affected by forecasted prepayment rates of the related assets 
if prepayment speeds are faster than modeled  the average life of the liability will shorten  and we will recognize the abs net premium at a faster rate  thereby increasing net income 
if prepayment speeds are slower than expected  the average life of the liability will lengthen  and it will take us longer to recognize the abs net premium 
for the deferred asset backed securities issuance costs  faster prepayments will result in faster amortization and an increase in interest expense while slower prepayments will result in slower amortization and a decrease in interest expense 
establishing valuations and accounting for changes in valuations we report our securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the estimates of fair value we use reflect fair values that we may be able to obtain should we choose to sell assets 
our estimates  however  are inherently subjective in nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment in interpreting relevant market and other data 
because we are also active acquirers  an issuer of debt securities  and an occasional seller of assets  we believe that we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the marketplace and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets 
however  changes in perceptions regarding future events in spreads used to price assets can have a material impact on the fair values of our assets 
should such changes occur  there could be significant decreases in the fair values of these assets 

table of contents our fair values reflect what we believe we could realize if we chose to sell our securities 
however  most of our securities in particular our ces and cdo investments are generally illiquid 
consequently  establishing fair values for these securities is inherently subjective and is dependent upon modeling assumptions and indications of value obtained from brokers or dealers 
as a consequence of limited trading visibility during the quarter and the significant uncertainties regarding credit loss levels  the fair values underpinning our market valuation adjustments are based on facts that are far less certain than has historically been the case in prior periods 
we expect that the market valuations will continue to be highly volatile over time 
to establish fair values at december   we derived values from our internal cash flow modeling utilizing indications of value marks and assumptions from dealers as inputs into our model 
we received third party dealer marks on of the number of securities reflected on our balance sheet 
we compared all of the dealers marks to our internal model for reasonableness 
it is likely that most of the dealer marks we received this period were based on pricing models and not on actual trade information 
the third parties we receive information from are active participants in these markets 
their indications of values are based on a variety of assumptions they may not share and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the aggregate  our internal valuations of the securities on which we received dealer marks were million  or  lower than the aggregate dealer marks at december  our internal valuations of our abs issued on which we received dealer marks were million  or less than  lower than the aggregate dealer marks at december  changes in the fair value of real estate securities held for sale are reported through equity 
however  it is possible that decreases in fair values of these real estate securities could be reported through the income statement 
see the discussion on other than temporary impairments below 
changes in the fair value of other real estate investments are reported through current period earnings as these are treated as trading instruments 
total income recognized in current period earnings on these investments equals coupon interest earned plus or minus change in fair value 
interest income is equal to the instruments yields based on market expectations 
see discussion below for changes in the fair value of securities and abs issued  elected under the fair value option from january  accounting under the fair value option effective january  we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
this gives us the option to elect to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities  and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option or fvo  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fvo is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
additionally  fas allows for a one time election for existing positions upon adoption  this transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings 
one of the chief objectives of this standard was to provide better matching of the accounting results to the economic activities underlying them 
for example  there may be assets or liabilities that are measured under the historical cost models while related transactions eg hedging derivatives or offsetting transactions are at fair value 
we have elected fvo on the assets and liabilities of acacia 
for the acacia assets this will mean that the ongoing changes in fair value will be reported through earnings instead of the current adjustment to other comprehensive income 
any unrealized gains or losses on acacia assets at january  were reclassified to retained earnings from other comprehensive income 
for the acacia liabilities  the mark to market to fair value on january  from the historical cost basis was also recorded in retained earnings at january  we expect to elect the fvo for any future acacia assets and liabilities 
as a result of the adoption we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of billion to stockholders equity as of january  other than temporary impairments for accounting purposes  securities are deemed impaired if the fair value is below amortized cost 
an assessment is then required as to whether the impairment is temporary and is reflected as unrealized losses in the balance sheet  or is other than temporary and realized through the income statement as market valuation 
table of contents adjustments 
the assessment of the other than temporary impairments requires a determination of whether there has been an adverse change in the underlying cash flows generated by a security  whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security  and whether we believe the impaired security will recover its value within a reasonable period of time 
this is a highly complex and subjective evaluation 
if  based on our assessment  we have an other than temporary impairment  then the basis of the asset is written down to fair value through our consolidated statements of loss income 
market valuation adjustments of this type could be substantial  reducing gaap income and causing a loss 
however  for securitized assets  reductions in fair values may not affect our cash flows or investment returns at all  or may not affect them to the degree implied by the accounting write down 
credit reserves on loans held for investment for consolidated real estate loans held for investment  we establish and maintain credit reserves that we believe represent probable credit losses that will result from intrinsic losses existing in our pool of consolidated real estate loans held for investment as of the date of the financial statements 
the reserves for credit losses are adjusted by taking provisions for credit losses recorded as a reduction in interest income on real estate loans on our consolidated statements of loss income 
the reserves consist of estimates of specific loan impairment and estimates of collective losses on pools of loans with similar characteristics 
to calculate the reserve for credit losses for real estate loans  we determine intrinsic losses by applying loss factors default  the timing of defaults  and the loss severity upon default that can be specifically applied to each pool of loans and estimate expected losses of each pool over their expected lives 
once we determine the loss factors  we then estimate the timing of these losses and the losses probable to occur over an effective loss confirmation period 
this period is defined as the range of time between the probable occurrence of a credit loss such as the initial deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and the confirmation of that loss the actual charge off of the loan 
the losses expected to occur within the estimated loss confirmation period are the basis of our credit reserves because we believe those losses exist as of the reported date of the financial statements 
we do not maintain a loan repurchase reserve  as any risk of loss due to loan repurchases ie  due to breach of representations would normally be covered by recourse to the companies from whom we acquired the loans 
accounting for derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage certain risks such as interest rate risk 
we may also acquire derivative financial instruments as investments 
derivative instruments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 
if a derivative instrument has a positive fair value  it is reported as an asset 
if the fair value is negative  the instrument is reported as a liability 
changes in fair values of derivative instruments are reported either through the income statement or through our equity 
for derivatives accounted for as trading instruments  all changes in the fair values are recognized through the income statement 
for interest rate agreements a type of derivative accounted for as a cash flow hedge  most of the changes in fair values are recorded in our balance sheet through equity 
only the ineffective portions as determined according to the accounting principle of the derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges are included in income 
using derivatives may increase our earnings volatility  as the accounting results for derivatives may not match the accounting results for the hedged asset or liability due to our inability to  or decision not to  meet the requirements for certain accounting treatments  or if the derivatives do not perform as intended 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide a discussion about market risks in item of this annual report on form k 
to supplement these discussions  the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our consolidated balance sheets 
this table presents just one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  based on certain underlying assumptions 
there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 

table of contents for our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the characteristics of our existing portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the interest rate scenario 
actual prepayment speeds will likely vary from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the composition of our balance sheets and the set of assumptions used at december  differ from those used at december  the assumptions we use reflect the market conditions at the date of the financial statements  so the future interest rates assumed and corresponding prepayment speeds used to project the cash flows differ from those used a year ago 
however  the overall results are similar in that our future results still depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans although the tabular information assumes no credit losses  future interest rates as many of our assets are adjustable rate  prepayment behavior on residential real estate loans  and our ability to reinvest our capital also not included in this tabular information
