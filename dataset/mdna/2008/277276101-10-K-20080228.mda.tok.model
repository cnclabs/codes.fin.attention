the company s core markets are in the states of florida  texas  arizona and california 
the company s primary revenue is rental income  as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space 
during  leases on  square feet of eastgroup s total square footage of  expired  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of that total 
in addition  eastgroup leased  square feet of other vacant space during the year 
during  average rental rates on new and renewal leases increased by 
eastgroup s total leased percentage was at december  compared to at december  leases scheduled to expire in were of the portfolio on a square foot basis at december   and this figure was reduced to as of february  property net operating income pnoi from same properties increased for as compared to the fourth quarter of was eastgroup s eighteenth consecutive quarter of same property pnoi growth

construction on the denver  colorado property purchased for redevelopment was completed in november eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a major contributor to the company s growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development through a board approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity 
during  the company transferred properties  square feet with aggregate costs of million at the date of transfer from development to real estate properties 
these properties  twelve of which are leased  are located in chandler  arizona  orlando  tampa and fort myers  florida  houston and san antonio  texas  and santa barbara  california 
during the second quarter of  the company executed a ten year lease for a  square foot build to suit development in its southridge commerce park in orlando 
the projected cost of this development is approximately million  construction began in june with occupancy projected in the second quarter of during  the company primarily funded its acquisition and development programs through a million line of credit 
in january  the company replaced its previous credit facility with a four year  million unsecured revolving credit facility as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as market conditions permit  eastgroup issues equity  including preferred equity  and or employs fixed rate  non recourse first mortgage debt to replace the short term bank borrowings 
on august   the company closed on a million  non recourse first mortgage loan secured by properties containing  square feet 
the loan has a fixed interest rate of  a ten year term and an amortization schedule of years

in july  the bankruptcy court approved the affirmation of tower s lease with eastgroup 
on july   tower announced that it had completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to tower automotive  llc  an affiliate of cerberus capital management  lp the sale concluded tower s restructuring process and finalized its emergence from chapter eastgroup has one reportable segment industrial properties 
these properties are primarily located in major sunbelt regions of the united states  have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  defined as net income loss computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes that the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the property s performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other reits 
the major factors that influence pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
real estate income is comprised of rental income  pass through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees 
property operating expenses are comprised of property taxes  insurance  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees  other operating costs and bad debt expense 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered 
the company believes ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity real estate investment trusts 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  nor is it a measure of the company s liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above  interest rates  the amount of leverage the company employs and general and administrative expense 
the following table presents the three fiscal years reconciliations of pnoi and ffo available to common stockholders to net income

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term  and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the industrial development stage  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense during construction and lease up  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalization of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management is not aware of any impairment issues nor has it experienced any significant impairment issues in recent years 
in the event of impairment  the property s basis would be reduced and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented 
in the event that the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge in the income statement 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sales price of properties sold through tax deferred exchanges  allowing for a deferral of capital gains on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the stockholders with no tax to the company  or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the stockholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the stockholders 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin was effective january  with few exceptions  the company s and earlier tax years are closed for examination by us federal  state and local tax authorities 
the adoption of fin in had an immaterial impact on the company s overall financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
the provisions of statement  with the exception of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the fasb deferred for one year the statement s fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these provisions will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  eastgroup accounts for its stock based compensation costs at fair value on the dates of grant as required under sfas no 
r 
also  as required under sfas no 
 the company accounts for its interest rate swap cash flow hedge on the tower automotive mortgage at fair value 
the application of statement to the company in had virtually no impact on the company s overall financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
and requires the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in addition  statement r requires that any goodwill acquired in the business combination be measured as a residual  and it provides guidance in determining what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the statement also requires that acquisition related costs be recognized as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and may not be applied before that date

inflation and other economic considerations most of the company s leases include scheduled rent increases 
additionally  most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
eastgroup s financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the company s properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some of the company s existing tenants to make lease payments and may impact our ability to renew leases or re let space as leases expire 
in addition  an economic downturn or recession could also lead to an increase in overall vacancy rates or decline in rents we can charge to re lease properties upon expiration of current leases 
in all of these cases  our cash flow would be adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and long term debt maturities 
this debt is used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s objective for interest rate risk management is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows at fixed rates but also has several variable rate bank lines as discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
the table below presents the principal payments due and weighted average interest rates for both the fixed rate and variable rate debt

the fixed rate debt shown above includes the tower automotive mortgage  which has a variable interest rate based on the one month libor

the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or by discounting expected cash flows at the rates currently offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities  as advised by the company s bankers 
as the table above incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the ultimate impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate bank debt as shown above changes by or approximately basis points  interest expense and cash flows would increase or decrease by approximately  annually 
the company has an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to the variable interest rate on the company s  tower automotive center recourse mortgage  which is summarized in the table below 
under the swap agreement  the company effectively pays a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
this swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and is considered to be fully effective in hedging the variable rate risk associated with the tower mortgage loan 
changes in the fair value of the swap are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
