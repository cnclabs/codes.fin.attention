item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified by reference to  our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item of this report and selected financial data included in item of this report 
on march   we identified an error related to the classification of certain investments  principally auction rate securities  which were incorrectly classified as cash and cash equivalents rather than marketable securities 
the following management s discussion and analysis gives affect to the restatement discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform of refer to the cautionary statement about forward looking statements preceding item of this report 
also  for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see risk factors in item a of this report 
we were founded in as a clean coal company focused on developing our k fuel process 
our goal is to leverage a vertically integrated  coal based platform to deliver clean  efficient and affordable energy 
we intend to meet the specific needs of public utility  industrial and international market customers by providing economical solutions to environmental emission standards compared to other emission standard alternatives 
our proprietary k fuel process uses heat and pressure to physically and chemically transform high moisture  low btu coals  such as sub bituminous coal and lignite  into a more energy efficient  lower emission fuel 
we  along with  our engineering consultants  bechtel power corporation  have completed the modifications and improvements of the design and efficiency of the equipment used in the k fuel process 
bechtel and evergreen s operations team at fort union completed successful testing of new operational systems that will support construction of future k fuel or k direct facilities  including a enhanced standard processing tower design 
this work signals that we and bechtel have resolved the most substantive technical challenges to scaling and commercializing our production process 
in february  we expanded our contractual relationship with bechtel to assist with future designs of additional k fuel facilities we may build or license  including any k fuel plants located at coal fired power generating plants  which we refer to as k direct plants 
on september   we amended and restated our umbrella agreement with bechtel power corporation 
through this new program management agreement  we committed to provide bechtel with billion in construction contracts through this restated agreement increases the scope of engineering  procurement and construction services which may be performed by bechtel 
we intend to use bechtel s services to oversee both technical development and implementation of all new facilities and existing plants  including both k fuel and k direct plants 
the fort union plant which was our first plant to implement the current k fuel process  has accomplished virtually all of the goals and objectives we set forth for this site 
most notably  as a result of operations at the fort union plant  we have proven that the k fuel process works by increasing btus and reducing mercury  sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions  successfully completed the redesign and testing of new operational systems  upgraded sufficient amounts of low rank coal for utility and industrial customers who completed a number of test burns of k fuel refined coal with favorable results  tested and improved product handling processes and requirements and improved transportation issues 
for the reasons discussed below  we have chosen to suspend operations at our fort union plant and mine site 
this will enable us to focus on future k fuel or k direct plants by redirecting constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of our process 
bechtel has completed the enhanced standard processing tower design based upon the results of testing completed by us at the fort union plant 
additionally  suspending production at this site will further enable us to reduce our cash utilization 
if the need arises  we are positioned to resume operations at the fort union plant to demonstrate the technology or to provide k fuel product for test burns at utilities or other industrial sites 
we are also evaluating redeploying some of the equipment to a future k fuel facility site 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the fort union plant and mine site as of december  the condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries  including the nine months ended december  for buckeye industrial mining co 
acquisition date of april  
we consolidate all of our majority owned subsidiaries and reflect as minority interest the portion of these entities that we do not own and reflected in other long term liabilities 
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
during the quarter ended september   we re evaluated our segments and have expanded our segment presentation to four segments to better reflect how our results of operations are now evaluated and allocations of capital resources are determined 
the plant segment primarily represents revenue and costs related to our fort union plant and our mine site in gillette  wyoming 
the mining segment primarily represents our mining operations at our buckeye location and includes certain marketing personnel  the ash disposal facility and the blending facility 
the c lock segment reflects the operations related to our worldwide sub license of a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities 
the technology segment is comprised of all other operations that use  apply  own or otherwise advance our proprietary  patented k fuel process  including our headquarters and related operations  activities of evergreen energy asia pacific and kfx technology  llc  which holds the licenses to our technology 
our operations are principally conducted in the united states 
we will continue to evaluate how we manage our business and  as necessary  adjust our segment reporting accordingly 
significant trends for the last several years  our operations have been focused on developing our technology and the construction of the fort union plant 
as a result  we have limited revenues from k fuel refined coal and  historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses 
with the addition of buckeye  we have begun to generate revenue and incurred more substantial mining costs 
in the future  we plan to build  own and operate k fuel and k direct refineries domestically and internationally  both wholly owned and through joint ventures 
through c lock technology we plan to generate revenues from our first of its kind web based system along with our patent pending technology that accurately measures greenhouse gases and certifies these environmental improvements as carbon credits 
as our operations expand  we expect our revenue and cost structure will also increase 
the following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will in the future have the most significant impact on our business 
revenue trends in the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources coal sales from our buckeye operations  revenues from production facilities including k fuel and k direct plants domestically and internationally  revenues from the measurement of carbon credits using our web based patent pending technology  licensing of our technology  including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant  and we have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain k fuel technology  which may limit our revenue from production of k fuel refined coal to the extent that the rights are exercised 
see note and to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
expense trends fort union we have chosen to suspend operations at our fort union plant and mine site 
this will enable us to focus on future k fuel or k direct plants by redirecting constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of our process 
bechtel has completed the enhanced standard processing tower design based upon the results of testing completed by us at the fort union plant 
additionally  suspending production at this site will further enable us to reduce our cash expenditures 
if the need arises  we are positioned to resume operations at fort union plant to demonstrate the technology or to provide k fuel product for test burns at utilities or other industrial sites 
we are also evaluating redeploying some of the equipment to a future k fuel facility site 
we will incur costs including labor  consulting and other costs to safely suspend operations at the plant 
future k fuel and k direct facilities as we build future k fuel and k direct facilities and these facilities begin continuous operation  we will incur additional operational expenses  the most significant being coal transportation costs  raw material costs  outsourced engineering and technical support  plant maintenance costs  plant personnel labor costs  fluid processing costs  by product and water disposal costs  and royalty costs  relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology  primarily the koppelman estate 
see further discussion of the royalty owed to the estate of edward koppelman in note deferred royalty costs in item of this report 
coal mining operating expenses with the acquisition of buckeye we have incurred mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility 
as the price of coal increases  we anticipate increasing our production at both our surface mines and underground mines 
we expect that the revenue generated from increased production will exceed the incremental mining costs 
general and administrative expenses as we identify business development opportunities  build new plants  and generally expand our business including hiring additional personnel at our corporate  future plants and c lock locations and outsourced professional services  we will incur additional expenses  the most significant of which are payroll and related burdens  non cash  share based compensation  business development costs for potential future k fuel and k direct plants  rent and utilities  and professional support fees 
we anticipate that accounting for non cash  share based compensation will add approximately million to million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses 
in the event we should achieve certain performance goals  we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs 
costs such as payroll and related burdens  professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and adding locations 
as we build new plants and expand our vertical integration strategy  we expect these costs to increase in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period ended december  the increase in revenue primarily relates to our april acquisition of buckeye 
during the year ended december   we owned buckeye for only nine months 
during the year ended december   we owned buckeye for the entire twelve month period 
revenues in our mining segment for the year ended december  were million and million for the same period ended december  respectively  as follows coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our buckeye operations 
buckeye coal sales  including transportation costs charged to customers  for the year ended december  were million or sales realization per ton sold and million or sales realization per ton sold for the period ended december  the decrease in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended december  was due to a mix of types of coals sold during and downward pressure on coal pricing  particularly during the first quarter of due depressed international coal prices 
during periods of depressed coal pricing  we strategically adjust the mix of coal we produce to focus less on our premium coals 
as prices have improved in  we began increasing production of our premium coals and anticipate that our sales realization per ton will increase in  as compared to brokered coal sales net include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers  which we ship directly to customers 
we recognized  of net revenue for the year ended december  compared to  of net revenue for the year ended december  we enter into brokered coals sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests  and as a result  revenues in this area fluctuate 
ash disposal revenues primarily include revenues generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi products at our ash pit in ohio 
ash disposal revenues were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
k fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our k fuel product to third parties 
blended k fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to k fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our buckeye operations and sold to third parties 
the remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in mining revenues 
k fuel refined coal and blended k fuel refined coal sales were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively and are included in our plant segment 
k fuel refined coal sales were less than expected primarily due to less production at our fort union plant for both periods 
coal mining operating expenses our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at buckeye  which principally comprises our mining segment 
coal mining operating expenses coal mining operating expenses include employee related costs  outside contracted mining costs for our underground mines  internal and external coal transportation costs  blasting  drilling  heavy equipment costs  purchased coal and other mining related costs 
coal mining operating expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase can be attributed to the acquisition of buckeye in april  resulting in recording nine months of buckeye s operation for the year ended december  compared to recording twelve months of buckeye s operations for the year ended december  ash disposal ash disposal expenses include employee related costs  consulting costs  costs of repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds  transportation  and heavy equipment costs and other costs associated with the ash disposal facility 
ash disposal expenses were million and million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative the following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands employee non cash  share based compensation   employee related costs   non cash  arch warrants  professional fees   office and travel costs   insurance and other   total general and administrative   employee non cash  share based compensation expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  substantially all of which related to our technology segment 
the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended in was primarily due to a one time million charge as a result of the termination of one of our executive officers and the acceleration of his restricted stock grant pursuant to his employment agreement and a one time  charge related to the departure of another executive officer and the acceleration of vesting of his restricted stock grant 
during  we entered into two agreements with arch coal  inc which allowed us to evaluate the potential of constructing and operating a plant at their coal creek mine site and required us to issue warrants 
in  we extended these agreements to allow additional time for the evaluation of the project 
in connection with the extension  the expiration date of the warrants was also extended and  pursuant to sfas r  we were required to recognize an additional million of non cash expense for the year ended december  based on discussions with arch coal  it was mutually agreed not to further extend these agreements 
the first agreement expired on september  and the warrant agreement expired on october  as market conditions and other circumstances change we may enter into new agreements with arch coal 
employee related costs primarily include salaries and wages  temporary employees  bonuses  benefits  employer payroll taxes and education and training 
the following table summarizes our employee related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant   mining   c lock total employee related   the increases for the year ended december  in comparison to the comparable period in were primarily due to a company wide increase in health insurance costs and adding personnel  including plant and engineering personnel 
in addition  through the acquisition of buckeye  we incurred twelve months of expense in compared to nine months of expense in the small increase in the technology segment and the substantial increase in the plant segment were due to more corporate resources being used at our fort union plant during and the associated allocation of those expenses 
professional fees include legal  audit and accounting  public relations  governmental relations and similar costs 
the following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant mining c lock total professional fees   office and travel costs include airfare  lodging  meals  office rent  marketing  office supplies  phone  publications  subscriptions and utilities 
the following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant mining c lock total office and travel   the anticipation of hiring additional employees at our corporate office led to our office expansion and relocation in may  and the related increases in rent  utilities and relocation costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended our travel for the year ended december  increased due an increase in the number of trips to our fort union plant as well as increased business development efforts 
in addition  during the same period we incurred non recurring charges relating to a loss on the sub lease of our former corporate office space and moving costs 
insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability  other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include  among other costs  various business and franchise taxes  licensing fees  repair and maintenance  engineering and technical services and director expenses 
the following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant mining c lock total insurance and other   the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period ended can be attributed to the following a licensing fee paid to the owner of the proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions related to the formation of our subsidiary  c lock technology  inc  which is reflected in the c lock segment  increase in insurance due to the acquisition of buckeye  which is reflected in the mining segment  increase in business development costs associated with the identification of key public utility leads  which are candidates for our process  and development of those leads  which is reflected in the technology segment  and overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our fort union plant  which is reflected in the plant segment 
plant start up costs plant start up costs include purchased raw materials  coal transportation  outsourced engineering and technical support  fluid processing  by products and water disposal  and employee related costs  which are reflected in our plant segment 
plant start up costs remain higher than anticipated due to general start up issues with this first of a kind plant and technical and operation improvements being implemented 
plant start up costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the majority of the year ended december   we were in the construction and commissioning phases and most of the costs incurred during these phases were capitalized 
during the year ended december   we were in the start up phase and a higher percentage of costs associated with the operations of our fort union plant were expensed as incurred 
in addition  non capitalized costs increased as a result of engineering and technical work performed to improve and reconfigure our fort union plant 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization are comprised of depreciation on our fort union plant using the units of production method  based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight line method  depletion  based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in ohio and wyoming  and amortization related to our patents 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period ended the increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of buckeye and the related depreciation and depletion on our mine sites and property and equipment for the year ended december  research and development research and development costs include costs incurred to advance  test  or otherwise modify our proprietary technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off site testing of our k fuel refined coal 
research and development costs were  and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of our fort union plant entering the start up phase of operation  which resulted in costs that were previously classified as research and development now being classified as plant start up costs 
cost of license and consulting revenue cost of license and consulting revenue includes costs to transfer our technology related to licensing and royalty agreements  including amortization of deferred royalty costs  salaries and wages of certain personnel and professional fees 
cost of licensing and consulting revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in these costs were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized on the licensing agreement we entered into in asset impairment charges and bad debt asset impairment and bad debt charges were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment charges for the year ended december  are as follows we suspended operations at our fort union plant and mine site to allow us focus on future k fuel or k direct plants by redirecting constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of our process 
we incurred impairment charges in our plant segment totalling million 
pursuant to the guidance of statements of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we are required to evaluate the fair value of our boiler  which is classified as held for sale 
as result  of this fair value calculation we impaired the carrying value of our boiler by million in our technology segment  we impaired million of capitalized costs related to projects that we abandoned and or replaced with more cost effective projects in our plant segment  and we impaired capital costs of million related to a previously announced future potential project with a major utility because it was determined not to be economically feasible in our technology segment 
other income expense interest income interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance  which was significantly lower compared to the same period in interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  and december  was million and  respectively 
the interest expense relates to our long term debt due  which we completed in july we pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum  due on february and august of each year  beginning on february  for additional information  see note long term debt included in item of this report 
other income expense during the year ended december   other expense was million as compared to million of other income for the same period ended pursuant to fas  we estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives as of july  when the notes were issued  and record those values as either assets or liabilities 
in addition  we are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each subsequent reporting period 
we recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of million 
this fair value adjustment is a non cash item and each quarter s estimation exercise is impacted  in part  by our stock price 
for additional information  see note long term debt included in item of this report 
on november   we completed an equity exchange transaction with rio tinto energy america services company rtea  formerly kennecott energy company 
as a part of the exchange transaction  an intercompany working capital loan from evergreen energy to pegasus technologies inc with an outstanding balance of million was exchanged for a contingent earn out agreement of up to million in the aggregate  plus accrued interest prime rate plus basis points  payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by pegasus 
due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows  we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction 
on may   rtea entered into a transaction involving its investment in pegasus 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement entered into between us and rtea dated november   which triggered the earn out provision  we received a payment of million during the year ended december  from pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the million contingent obligation 
this transaction had no effect on our note receivable from pegasus with an outstanding balance of  net of an allowance of million  which is included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
we have been and expect to continue to  receive payments on this note 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the same period ended december  the increase in revenue for the period ended december  is substantially related to our april acquisition of buckeye 
our mining segment accounted for million in revenue for the period ended december  we recognized revenue of  from the million up front licensing fee received in december from cook inlet coal llc in our technology segment for the year ended december  to date we have completed all of our contractual deliverables for the licensing fee and are waiting for cook inlet coal to provide specific site information before the next phase of revenue recognition can commence 
coal mining operating expenses our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at buckeye  which principally comprises our mining segment 
coal mining operating expenses were million and for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in coal mining operating expenses for the period ended december  is related to our april acquisition of buckeye 
general and administrative the following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands employee non cash  share based compensation   employee related costs   non cash  arch warrants   professional fees   office and travel costs   insurance and other   total general and administrative   employee non cash  share based compensation expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  substantially all of which related to our technology segment 
the increase in non cash  share based compensation was in direct correlation with the adoption of sfas r as of january  see note stock options  stock grants and employee benefit plans for further discussion in item of this report 
non cash  share based compensation in primarily related to restricted stock and option grants to our executive officers 
during  we entered into two agreements with arch coal  inc which allowed us to evaluate the potential of constructing and operating a plant at their coal creek mine site and required us to issue warrants 
in  we incurred million of non cash expense related to the issuance of these warrants to arch coal  inc in  we extended these agreements to allow additional time for the evaluation of the project 
in connection with the extension  the expiration date of the warrants was also extended and  pursuant to sfas r  we were required to recognize an additional million of non cash expense for the year ended december  based on discussions with arch coal  it was mutually agreed not to further extend these agreements 
the first agreement expired on september  and the warrant agreement expired on october  the following table summarizes our employee related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant  mining  c lock total employee related   employee related costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases for the year ended december  were primarily related to an increase in the number of employees  which increased salaries and related burdens 
during  we added personnel in many areas  including engineering and business development 
in addition  the number of employees increased as a result of the buckeye acquisition 
the following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant mining c lock total professional fees   the increases can be attributed to a general overall increase in legal and accounting fees when compared to the same period ended the following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant mining c lock total office and travel   the majority of the increase is attributed to our increase in the number of employees at our corporate office and as a result of our acquisition of buckeye 
in addition  we increased our travel related to our expanded business development efforts  including travel to our ohio subsidiary and travel to identify potential sites for future plants 
we also saw an increase in travel to our fort union plant site by non plant related employees and management in  as the plant entered the startup phase 
the following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands technology   plant mining c lock total insurance and other   the increase can be attributed primarily to an overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our corporate and our buckeye operations 
plant start up costs plant start up costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
plant start up costs were higher than anticipated due to general start up issues with this first of a kind plant and the acceleration of initial production runs 
the commissioning of the facility at this accelerated pace resulted in a number of plant operating inefficiencies 
we incurred higher feed stock costs as we chose to purchase coal from a nearby mine and incurred trucking costs for the transportation of that purchased coal 
outsourced engineering and employee related costs were incurred to assist with the acceleration of the initial production 
the water handling system was limited in its ability to process water from the production process 
disposal of this excess water required utilizing third parties to transport water to approved disposal sites 
this resulted in higher water disposal costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization are comprised of depreciation on our fort union plant using the units of production method  based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight line method  depletion  based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in ohio and wyoming  and amortization related to our patents 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to  during the same period ended the increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of buckeye in the second quarter of research and development research and development costs were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
cost of license and consulting revenue cost of licensing and consulting revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in these costs were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized in on the licensing agreement we entered into in asset impairment charges and bad debt asset impairment and bad debt charges were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we wrote off  of certain site specific costs  which we were evaluating for a future k fuel facility 
through a series of transactions  pegasus became indebted to us for million 
we have rights to collect payments under this note from pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default 
during the year ended december   we determined that pegasus might not have sufficient contracts to continue to meet this obligation 
therefore  we have recorded an allowance for bad debt for the note receivable of million 
despite this allowance  we retain all of our rights to collect payments under this note from pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default 
interest income interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance  which was significantly higher compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of our public stock offering in february of other income  net other income was million for the year ended december  in  we completed an equity exchange transaction pursuant to which we transferred our interest in pegasus technologies  inc for full ownership of k fuel llc  now part of a wholly owned subsidiary named kfx technology  llc 
as a part of this exchange transaction  we exchanged an intercompany working capital loan with pegasus with an outstanding balance of million for a contingent earn out agreement of up to million in the aggregate  plus accrued interest prime rate plus basis points  payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by pegasus 
due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows  we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction 
as a result of a transfer of ownership interests  the earn out provisions were triggered and we received a payment of million from pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the million obligation 
liquidity and capital resources discussion our cash will primarily be used to fund corporate operations and for capital expenditures for future k fuel and or k direct facilities and corporate purposes 
our capital expenditures for are expected to be less than million which includes buckeye mining and development costs  and costs associated with k fuel and k direct facilities 
we expect that our capital expenditures budget for may increase as we proceed with the potential construction of future k fuel plants and obtain additional funding for these projects 
in july  the fabricator of the boiler island completed certain fabrication and engineering work which provided an appropriate point to temporarily suspend construction 
we have classified this boiler as held for sale in the amount of million 
we agreed with the fabricator to suspend further construction on the boiler 
effective january   we and the fabricator of the boiler island agreed to terminate the contract and as a result  all future financial obligations were also terminated 
we have been in discussions with several potential buyers for the sale of this boiler and anticipate the consummation of this sale in the future 
we believe because of the decision to suspend operations and construction at our fort union plant and mine sites  along with the anticipated cash flows from our buckeye operations  that our current cash level is sufficient to support our corporate operations  including starting preliminary site investigation  design  permitting and similar long lead time activities related to k fuel plants and or k direct plants located at coal fired power generating and industrial facilities for at least the next twelve months 
however  as we identify strategic opportunities to accelerate projects of large scale commercial k fuel facilities and or k direct facilities  or other agreements such as joint ventures  we will need to obtain additional funding 
we plan to seek additional capital from time to time as needed principally through equity offerings or the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  debt offerings  and partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large scale commercial plants through the formation of joint ventures 
while we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described  we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available to us or be on terms acceptable to us 
on july   we completed the sale of million of long term debt due that was resold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are senior  secured obligations guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary  evergreen operations  llc  and its subsidiaries  and secured by a first priority security interest in all of our equity interests in evergreen operations  llc  an escrow account established in connection with the offering  and our and each of our subsidiaries bank  investment  brokerage or similar accounts holding cash and cash equivalents  subject to certain exceptions 
we will pay interest semi annually at a rate of per annum  due on february and august of each year  beginning on february  the notes mature on august  we incurred costs of million in connection with the sale of the notes 
pursuant to the offering  we deposited million of the net proceeds in the escrow account referred to above 
we plan on using the remaining proceeds for buckeye capital expenditures  for general corporate purposes and future construction of k fuel or k direct facilities 
if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period is at least the conversion price  or the reduced interest rate threshold  and if the shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is effective and available for use for at least days following the reduced interest rate threshold  unless registration is no longer required  then the initial interest rate will be permanently decreased to 
in addition  if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period is at least of the then applicable conversion price  or the collateral release threshold  and if the shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes is effective and available for use for at least days following the collateral release threshold  unless registration is no longer required  then the security will be released  including the million held in escrow  and the notes will become automatically subordinated 
at such time as the security is released  we may redeem the notes at a redemption price payable in cash equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest and an additional coupon make whole payment 
the coupon make whole amount per  principal amount of notes will be equal to the present value of all remaining scheduled payments of interest on each note to be redeemed through the maturity date 
on october   we and the subsidiary guarantors filed a post effective amendment and prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering the resale of the notes  guarantees and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the registration statement  post effective amendment and prospectus supplement were automatically effective upon filing with the securities and exchange commission 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share pursuant to a follow on common stock offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we used part of the proceeds from this offering to fund the acquisition of buckeye and the construction of our fort union plant 
we plan on using the remaining funds for new k fuel and k direct facility construction costs and general corporate purposes 
payment obligations the following table summarizes our future commitments as of december  payments due by period thereafter total in thousands operating leases      capital lease and other obligations consulting and service commitments long term debt      total commitments     this table does not include accounts payable  accrued expenses  or asset retirement obligations  which are reported in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
we generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below 
additionally  we have not included royalty payments  as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties 
we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space

critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base estimates on historical experience and or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term 
set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally when an agreement has been signed  all significant obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
any up front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements 
as our history related to customer relationships is limited  we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available 
arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are deemed separable  total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if the elements are not deemed separable  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are critical accounting estimates because they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  for which we have limited history  the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective  and the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material 
accounts and notes receivable and allowances 
receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalization of costs 
generally  we expense plant start up costs as incurred that do not extend the life of the plant or increase production volumes 
in addition  we expense mine exploration costs as incurred 
once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal  we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs 
we have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs 
judgment is exercised in determining i if costs extend the life of the plant  ii if costs increase plant production volumes  and iii the feasibility of extracting coal 
if these judgments are incorrect  we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should 
mineral rights and mine development 
a significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements 
costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights  including capitalized premining costs  are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units of production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and recoverable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value 
premining costs include drilling  permitting  county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal 
we used assumptions such as selling price of coal  costs to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at buckeye 
if the assumptions used to value the proven and recoverable reserves change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
useful lives of our long lived assets 
selecting the useful lives of long lived assets to be depreciated  depleted or amortized requires a significant amount of judgment 
we placed our fort union plant into service in the third quarter of as this is the first of its kind plant  assumptions were made in order to estimate the total expected production for the life of the plant 
these assumptions were primarily based upon research and inquiry of our engineers 
valuation of long lived assets 
the valuation of our long lived and intangible assets  including our fort union plant  mineral rights and patents  have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimates and assumptions related to our fort union plant are particularly difficult to determine as it is a first of its kind facility 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
asset retirement obligations 
we are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset 
initially  our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach  in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit adjusted risk free rate were applied 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation 
in determining the initial liability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
in addition  the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase 
if these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future  we may be required to increase our obligation 
accounting for stock grants  options and warrants 
we issue stock grants  options and warrants to employees  board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities 
in accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments  the periods benefited and forfeiture rates 
these estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders equity and general and administrative expense 
if these estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments the host instrument 
embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument  the terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value 
these embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control 
if these assumptions and estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
if our expected volatility of our common stock decreased by  the impact would have been an increase in other expenses of  if our expected volatility of our common stock increased by  the impact would have been an increase in other income of  accounting for acquisitions 
the acquisition of businesses is an important element of our strategy 
we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements 
for example  the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
marketable securities we classify our marketable securities as available for sale 
as of december  and  we had available for sale investments in auction rate securities ars with a carrying value of million and million as of december  the types of ars investments that we own are backed by student loans  the majority of which are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and all had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
the interest rates on these ars are reset every to days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
as a result of the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  in february and march  auctions for a certain ars investment held by us failed 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating the holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
the carrying value of our investments in ars as of december  represents our best estimate of the fair value of these investments based on currently available information 
the estimated fair value calculated at december  was determined to be the carrying value as of december  the estimation process included consideration of such factors as issuer and insurer credit rating  comparable market data  if available  credit enhancement structures  projected yields  discount rates and terminal periods 
due to the uncertainty in the credit markets  it is reasonably possible the fair value of these investments may change in the near term 
if the credit markets recover and successful auctions resume  we may be able to recover an amount greater than the carrying value of the ars as of december   which would result in a gain 
however  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of its investment in ars through impairment charges 
recent accounting pronouncements on july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize  in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin were effective as of january  we have evaluated our tax positions and determined that the adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  released staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
expresses the sec staff s view regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the interpretations in sab no 
was issued to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
sab no 
is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results our operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the financial accounting standards board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of evaluating the impacts  if any  of adopting this pronouncement 
in may  the financial accounting standards board  as part of an effort to conform to international accounting standards  issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which was effective for us beginning on january  sfas no 
requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principles be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements as if that principle had always been used  unless it is impracticable to do so 
when it is impracticable to calculate the effects on all prior periods  sfas no 
requires that the new principle be applied to the earliest period practicable 
since adoption  sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to the following market risks in our business some of the products used in our mining activities  such as diesel fuel and explosives  are subject to commodity price risk 
we expect to consume million to million gallons of fuel per year 
on a per gallon basis  based on this usage  a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase in our operating costs of approximately  per year 
alternatively  a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately  ignoring embedded derivatives  we own or hold no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities 
currently  we have no significant foreign operations 
we were required to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in euros  which will be adjusted to account for the change in foreign currency rates 
as these adjustments are made we will either increase or decrease our restricted cash balance 
at this time we are still evaluating our exposure to these foreign currency rate adjustments 
however  to the extent that we establish significant foreign operations in the future  we may attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate 
we hold no equity market securities  which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities
