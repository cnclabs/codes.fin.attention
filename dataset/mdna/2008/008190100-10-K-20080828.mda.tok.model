item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide non core  mission critical services that our clients need to run their day to day business 
we believe the market for our services is vast 
the demand for our services has grown in recent years and we believe that this demand will continue to grow as the overall acceptance of outsourcing increases in both the commercial and government segments 
the cornerstone of our business strategy is our focus on vertical markets and technology solutions that we can leverage across our business and client base 
we enter into long term relationships with clients to provide services that meet their ongoing business requirements while supporting their mission critical business process or information technology needs 
we derive our revenues from delivering comprehensive business process outsourcing and information technology services solutions to commercial and government clients 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from recurring monthly charges to our clients under service contracts with initial terms that vary from one to ten years 
the recurring nature of our revenue provides us with predictable revenue streams regardless of the economic cycle 
we define recurring revenues as revenues derived from services that our clients use each year in connection with their ongoing businesses  and accordingly  exclude software license fees  short term contract programming and consulting engagements  product installation fees  and hardware and software sales 
however  if we add consulting or other services to enhance the value delivered and offered to our clients that are primarily short term in nature  we may experience variations in our mix of recurring versus non recurring revenues 
new business pipeline management focuses on various metrics in analyzing our business and its performance and outlook 
one such metric is our sales pipeline  which was approximately billion of annual recurring revenues as of june  our sales pipeline includes potential business opportunities that will be contracted within the next six months and excludes business opportunities with estimated annual recurring revenue that are in excess of million 
both the commercial and government pipelines have significant  quality opportunities within our vertical markets and horizontal solutions 
as of june   the commercial segment comprised approximately of our pipeline and the government segment comprised the remaining 
by service line  approximately of our pipeline is business process outsourcing and approximately of the pipeline is information technology solutions as of june  the commercial segment pipeline includes opportunities in information technology services  commercial healthcare  transactional business process outsourcing and finance and accounting outsourcing 
the government segment pipeline includes opportunities in our domestic and international 
table of contents transportation business  in the state and local market for information technology and eligibility services and in government healthcare and with the federal government 
while the magnitude of our sales pipeline is an important indicator of potential new business signings and potential future internal revenue growth  actual new business signings and internal revenue growth depend on a number of factors including the effectiveness of our sales pursuit teams  competition for a deal  deal pricing  cash flow generation qualities of each deal and are subject to risks described further in item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
new business signings we define new business signings as estimated annual recurring revenue from new contracts and the incremental portion of renewals that are signed during the period  which represents the estimated first twelve months of revenue to be recorded under the contracts after full implementation 
we use new business signings to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments 
revenues for new business signings are measured under gaap defined below 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of new business signings and our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we define total contract value as the estimated total revenues from contracts signed during the period 
we use total contract value as an additional measure of estimating total revenue represented by contractual commitments  both to forecast prospective revenues and to estimate capital commitments 
revenues for annual recurring revenue and total contract value are measured under gaap 
during fiscal year  we signed contracts with new clients and incremental business with existing clients representing million of annual recurring revenue with an estimated billion in total contract value 
the commercial segment contributed of the new contract signings and the government segment contributed of the new contract signings based on annual recurring revenues 
internal revenue growth we use internal revenue growth as a measure of the organic growth of our business 
internal revenue growth is measured as total revenue growth less revenues from acquisitions and revenues from divested operations 
at the date of an acquisition  we identify the trailing twelve months of revenue of the acquired company as the pre acquisition revenue of acquired companies 
pre acquisition revenue of the acquired companies is considered acquired revenues in our calculation  and actual revenues from the acquired company  either above or below acquired revenues are components of internal growth in our calculation 
revenues from divested operations are excluded from the internal revenue growth calculation in the periods following the effective date of the divestiture 
we believe these adjustments to historical reported results are necessary to accurately reflect our internal revenue growth 
prior period internal revenue growth calculations are not restated for current period divestitures 
our measure of internal revenue growth may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
in fiscal year  total revenue grew over the prior fiscal year and internal revenue grew over the prior fiscal year 
client renewal rates we focus on the performance of our contractual obligations and continually monitor client satisfaction 
renewal rates are the best indicator of client satisfaction 
we calculate our renewal rate based on the total annual recurring revenue of renewals won as a percentage of total annual recurring revenue of all renewals sought 
in fiscal year  we renewed approximately of total renewals sought  totaling million of annual recurring revenue with a total contract value of approximately billion 
average contract life for renewals varies between our government and commercial segments 
the average contract life of renewals in the government segment is often longer than those in the commercial segment 
capital intensity management responds to technological advances and the rapid changes in the requirements of our clients by committing substantial amounts of our resources to the operation of multiple hardware platforms  the customization of products and services that incorporate new technology on a timely basis and the continuous training of our personnel 
management continually assesses the capital intensity of these technological advances and client requirements  addressing the challenge to stay ahead of the competition for innovative solutions and provide a lower cost solution for clients 
we monitor the capital intensity  defined as the total of capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets as a percentage of revenue  of new business signings 
understanding the capital intensity of new business signings is critical in determining the future free cash flow generating levels of our business 
historically  the capital intensity in our business has ranged between and of revenue 
during fiscal years and  the overall capital intensity of our business was 
table of contents approximately and of revenues  respectively 
we expect that as our new business signings ramp  we will incur capital expenditures associated with the new business  which could result in increased capital intensity over the fiscal year percentage  but we expect that the capital intensity will remain within our historical range 
we believe the expected capital intensity range of our new business signings reflects a healthy competitive environment and the related risks we are taking with respect to our new business process outsourcing business and information technology services business 
employees attracting  retaining and training our employees has been a key component to our historical success and will continue to be a major factor in our future success 
because we operate in intensely competitive markets  our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel 
we consistently review our employee retention rates on a regional and global basis to ensure that we are competitive in hiring  retaining and motivating our employees 
we perform benchmarking studies in some markets in which we compete to ensure our competitiveness in compensation and benefits and utilize employee surveys to gauge our employees level of satisfaction 
we provide our employees ongoing technological  management  financial and leadership training and will continue to do so to develop our employees and remain competitive 
we utilize activity based compensation as a means to motivate certain of our employees in both segments of our business and believe our use of activity based compensation is a competitive advantage for acs 
other we identified a number of risk factors in item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
management continually monitors the general economic conditions  changes in technology and other developments in the markets we serve  competitive pricing trends and contractual terms for future impact on the company in order to be able to respond effectively and on a timely basis to these developments 
we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
however  we believe that certain non gaap financial measures and ratios  used in managing our business  may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results 
certain of the information set forth herein and certain of the information presented by us from time to time including free cash flow and internal revenue growth may constitute non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g adopted by the sec 
we have presented herein and we will present in other information we publish that contains any of these non gaap financial measures a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
the presentation of this non gaap information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable amounts determined in accordance with gaap 
fiscal year outlook our primary goal for fiscal is to increase internal revenue growth 
we believe we will be able to accomplish this goal as our fiscal year new business signings generate incremental revenue in fiscal year and we continue to increase the level of new signings in fiscal year as a premier provider of business process outsourcing and information technology services  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from commercial and governmental entities demand to outsource non core  mission critical functions 
we expect demand for commercial business process and information technology services to remain strong during fiscal year we also anticipate our existing commercial clients will seek to increase their use of outsourcing as a means to increase their operating efficiency and reduce their costs in the future 
we believe the commercial segment will experience strong demand in fiscal year for transactional business process outsourcing  finance and accounting outsourcing  customer care outsourcing and traditional information technology services 
we anticipate strong demand for our government services 
in addition to the areas that we have marketed historically  such as government healthcare  municipal services  electronic payment services and transportation services and solutions  we continue to believe that government entities could benefit from our commercial best practices in such areas as eligibility administration  human resources outsourcing  customer care and finance and accounting outsourcing 
we anticipate growth in certain areas of the government business that have historically grown  such as revenue generating services and entitlement programs  when state and local clients have experienced budget pressure 
this trend gives us confidence in our business model and its defensive counter cyclical nature 
in the government segment  we expect to expand our technology solutions and platforms  including our software solutions in the state medicaid market 
we expect to leverage our existing broad international presence and subject matter expertise in 
table of contents the transportation market to markets beyond transportation 
we believe we can expand our existing solutions in the property  public safety and judicial markets into solutions that we can market globally 
our non compete agreement with lockheed martin corporation expires in november the expiration of this agreement will allow us to compete for federal government contracts  beyond our current relationships with the department of education and other federal agencies 
from a geographic perspective  we believe that there will continue to be strong demand in the united states and expect to see more business process outsourcing opportunities in europe and abroad 
our acquisitions of sds business services gmbh and syan holdings limited strengthen our global information technology outsourcing presence in europe and the united kingdom 
we also intend to pursue strategic acquisitions in certain vertical markets that will enhance our existing service capabilities  expand our service offerings and increase our service innovation through technology solutions that we can leverage 
we expect to strengthen our organization by promoting leaders from within the company as well as recruiting top industry talent 
in both segments  we also plan to increase our penetration of low cost delivery locations outside the united states and to deepen our use of incentive based compensation

also contributing to the increase in other non operating income  net were increases in interest income on cash investments and long term investments  including those supporting our deferred compensation plans 
the compensation cost related to our deferred compensation plans is included in wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this effective income tax rate is comprised of the following an effective tax rate on operations of  an effective tax rate on the csb software impairment charges of and a reduction in rate attributable to one time benefits realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year we reversed million in income tax expense related to amounts previously accrued for cash based compensation related issues associated with section m deductions please see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our effective income tax rate on operations for fiscal year is higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we generated approximately million  million and million in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal years  and  respectively 
significant items affecting our fiscal years  and cash flows provided by operating activities are discussed below dollars in millions 
fiscal year ended june  cash paid for interest on outstanding debt cash paid for legal fees and other costs related to the investigations into our stock option grant practices  derivative lawsuits related to our stock option grant practices and the potential sale of the company cash received for interest income cash paid to certain current and former employees related to stock options cash paid on tax  interest and penalties related to our stock option grant practices cash paid for final settlement of the mellon financial corporation mellon transition services agreement a cash paid for incentive compensation to employees of the acquired hr business a cash flow used by items listed above a during fiscal year  we paid approximately million related to the final settlement of the mellon transition services agreement 
under the transition services agreement  mellon provided certain accounting  treasury and payroll services for an interim period while we integrated the acquired hr business 
as part of these services  mellon was also paying certain operational costs on our behalf  such as employee related expenses and accounts payable 
this agreement and the related timing of payments to mellon had a favorable impact on our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow defined below in fiscal year of million and a negative impact on our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal year of million when the acquired hr business was fully integrated 
during fiscal year  we also paid approximately million to employees of the acquired hr business related to incentive compensation that was earned prior to the date that we acquired the business 

table of contents in addition to the reduced cash outflows noted in the table above  our increased fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were positively impacted by higher operating income  excluding the million non cash software impairment charge  lower income tax payments in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  and favorable timing of vendor payments  offset by the growth in our accounts receivable and increased incentive compensation payments made in fiscal year  but which were earned and accrued in fiscal year the growth in our accounts receivable was caused by increases in unbilled accounts receivable  primarily in our government segment  where revenues recognized under a cost plus contract and also under certain percentage of completion contracts were higher than the related billings and collections during the fiscal year 
our increased fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities  compared to fiscal year  were negatively impacted by increased cash outflows noted in the table above  but were positively benefited by reduced incentive compensation payments made in fiscal year due to lower operating performance in fiscal year  increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced payments for hardware and software maintenance  as compared to fiscal year additionally  the timing of payments collected for unearned revenue in fiscal year was reduced  compared to fiscal year fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were also impacted by an increase in accounts receivables related to signed new business and timing of collections related to other accounts receivable and payments of approximately million related to the departure of jeffrey a 
rich  our former chief executive officer 
these decreases were offset by lower annual incentive compensation payments and timing of payments to vendors 
accounts receivable fluctuations may have a significant impact on our cash flows provided by operating activities 
accounts receivable can be negatively impacted by growth in revenues in one fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year  where collections typically lag behind the related client billings  resulting in a use of cash for operating activities 
conversely  when revenue growth slows  then accounts receivable is positively impacted  resulting in a source of cash for operating activities 
additionally  accounts receivable is impacted by contracts where we apply percentage of completion accounting in the recognition of revenues 
under such contracts we may receive a different amount of payments from the clients during that fiscal year than the amount that we record as revenues during the same period 
such payments are typically dependent on original contract negotiations as to the timing of when such payments are due  and based on actual operational performance in the delivery of the contract milestones and associated client acceptance required under the contracts 
free cash flow is measured as cash flow provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows  less capital expenditures purchases of property  equipment and software  net  as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows less additions to other intangible assets as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe this free cash flow metric provides an additional measure of available cash flow after we have satisfied the capital expenditure requirements of our operations  and should not be taken in isolation to be a measure of cash flow available for us to satisfy all of our obligations and execute our business strategies 
we also rely on cash flows from financing activities which  together with free cash flow  are expected to be sufficient for us to execute our business strategies 
our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table sets forth the calculations of free cash flow in thousands fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  equipment and software  net additions to other intangible assets free cash flow our capital expenditures  defined as purchases of property  equipment and software  net  and additions to other intangible assets  were approximately million  or of total revenues  million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
historically  the capital intensity of our business has ranged between to 
during fiscal year  the overall capital intensity of our business was due to approximately million of investments for the following investments related to integrating the acquired hr business and expanding our human resources outsourcing technology platform  investments made in our government healthcare technology platforms  the expansion of our data center capacity with the addition of a new data center and investments to increase global production both in existing locations and new geographies 
we expect that as our new business signings ramp  we will incur capital expenditures associated with the new business  which could result in increased capital intensity over the fiscal year percentage  but we expect that the capital intensity will remain within our historical range

there may be additional reductions in our ratings depending on the timing and amounts that may be drawn under our credit facility 
as a result  the terms of any financings we choose to enter into in the future may be adversely affected 
in addition  as a result of these downgrades  the sureties which provide performance bonds backing our contractual obligations could reduce the availability of these bonds  increase the price of the bonds to us or require us to provide collateral such as a letter of credit 
however  we believe that we will continue to have sufficient capacity in the surety markets and liquidity from our cash flow and credit facility to respond to future requests for proposals 
in addition  certain of our commercial outsourcing contracts provide that  in the event our credit ratings are downgraded to certain specified levels  the client may elect to terminate its contract with us and either pay a reduced termination fee or in some limited instances  no termination fee 
while we do not anticipate that the downgrading of our credit ratings will result in a material loss of commercial outsourcing revenue due to the client s exercise of these termination rights  there can be no assurance that such a credit ratings downgrade will not adversely affect these client relationships

we believe that available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth and operating needs  including capital expenditures  and will meet the cash requirements of our contractual obligations 
however  due to the additional borrowings made in relation to our share repurchase programs and if we utilize the unused portion of our credit facility to repay the senior notes or for other corporate purposes  our indebtedness and interest expense would increase  possibly significantly  and our indebtedness could be substantial in relation to our stockholders equity 
should interest rates rise  our interest expense could increase and impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that our expected cash flow provided by operating activities  and anticipated access to the unused portion of our credit facility and capital markets will be adequate for our expected liquidity needs  including capital expenditures  and to meet the cash requirements of our contractual obligations 
in addition  we intend to continue our growth through acquisitions  which could require significant commitments of capital

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements involve significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria that do not require significant estimates or uncertainties 
for example  transaction volumes and time and material and cost reimbursable arrangements are based on specific  objective criteria under the contracts 
accordingly  revenues recognized under these methods do not require the use of significant estimates that are susceptible to change 
revenue recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method does require the use of estimates and judgment as discussed below 
our policy follows the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  unless the transaction is within the scope of other specific authoritative guidance 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been provided to the client  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenue was recognized based on transaction volumes  approximately was fixed fee based  wherein our revenue is earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the arrangement  approximately was related to cost reimbursable contracts  approximately of our revenue was recognized using percentage of completion accounting and the remainder is related to time and material contracts 
our revenue mix is subject to change due to the impact of acquisitions  divestitures and new business 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenues on unit price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and accepted by the client 
revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered  generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed 
information technology processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client  generally at the contractual selling prices of resources consumed or capacity utilized by our clients 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties regarding client acceptance have expired 
revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services are recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that are binding agreements between us and our clients in which we agree  for compensation  to perform a service to the client s specifications 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive and complex design  development  
table of contents modification and implementation activities for our clients systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with the agreement 
the percentage of completion methodology involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to estimated total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the longer term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
at times  we may contract with a client to provide more than one service  for instance  we may contract for an implementation or development project and also provide services or operate the system over a period of time 
in these situations  we follow the guidance of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total arrangement consideration to the contract elements but does not stipulate the revenue recognition methodology that should be applied to these separate elements 
once the contract has been separated under the guidance of eitf and arrangement consideration allocated  revenue recognition for each of the segments follows the applicable revenue recognition method  as described above 
in certain instances where revenue cannot be allocated to a contract element delivered earlier than other elements  costs of delivery are deferred and recognized as the subsequent elements are delivered 
costs deferred cannot exceed the relative fair value of the related element and are tested for impairment regularly 
revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued  whereas billings in excess of revenues earned are deferred until the related services are provided 
we recognize revenues for non refundable  upfront implementation fees on a straight line basis over the period between the initiation of the ongoing services through the end of the contract term 
cost of revenues we present cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the costs incurred 
substantially all these costs are incurred in the provision of services to our clients 
the selling  general and administrative costs included in cost of revenues are not material and are not separately presented in the consolidated statements of income 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
our contracts with clients typically span several years 
we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss accrual is recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the period it is first identified  if allowed by relevant accounting guidance 
circumstances that could potentially result in contract losses over the life of the contract include variances from expected costs to deliver our services  and other factors affecting revenues and costs 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an impairment 
in addition  in connection with our revenue arrangements  we incur costs to originate long term contracts and to perform the transition and setup activities necessary to enable us to perform under the terms of the arrangement 
we capitalize certain incremental direct costs which are related to the contract origination or transition  implementation and setup activities and amortize them over the term of the arrangement 
from time to time  we also provide certain inducements to clients in the form of various arrangements  including contractual credits  which are capitalized and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the term of the contract 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
in addition to our annual impairment testing  we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we 
table of contents compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its underlying book value 
in evaluating intangible assets for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its underlying book value 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets  such revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
valuation of property  equipment and software we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of our property  equipment and software may not be recoverable 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property  equipment and software  such revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
stock based compensation sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r requires us to recognize compensation expense for all stock based payment arrangements based on the fair value of the stock based payment on the date of grant 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model that employs the following assumptions expected volatility of our stock price based on historical monthly volatility over the expected term 
expected term of the option based on historical employee stock option exercise behavior and the vesting and contractual terms of the respective option 
risk free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the option 
expected dividend yield 
our stock price volatility and expected option lives are based on management s best estimates at the time of grant  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting term of the option 
sfas r requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of stock based payment arrangements that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are based on historical employee termination behavior 
we periodically adjust the estimated forfeiture rates so that only the compensation expense related to stock based payment arrangements that vest are included in wages and benefits 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
pension and post employment benefits sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  establishes standards for reporting and accounting for pension benefits provided to employees 
on june   we adopted sfas employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
this statement requires recognition of the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the statement of financial position as an asset or liability if the plan is overfunded or underfunded  respectively 
changes in the funded status of a plan are required to be recognized in the year in which the changes occur  and reported in comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
further  certain gains and losses that were not previously recognized in the financial statements are required to be reported in comprehensive income  and certain disclosure requirements were changed 
sfas also requires the measurement date of the plan s funded status to be the same as the company s fiscal year end 
there was no change to our june measurement date as a result of the adoption of sfas
