sales and channel strategy consumer products we sell our consumer products and services to individuals and home offices globally through a multi tiered network of distribution partners 
our strategy is to place our products in a variety of channels where consumers might consider purchasing security  pc tuneup and backup products 
our products are available to customers through channels that include distributors  retailers  direct marketers  internet based resellers  oems  system builders  educational institutions  and isps 
we separately sell annual content update subscriptions directly to end users primarily through the internet 
we also sell some of our products and product upgrades in conjunction with channel partners through direct mail email and over the internet 
sales in the consumer products business through our electronic distribution channel  which includes sales derived from oems  subscriptions  upgrades  online sales  and renewals  grew by million in fiscal over fiscal during fiscal  approximately percent of revenue in the consumer products segment came from our electronic channels 
enterprise solutions we sell and market our products and related services to enterprise customers both directly and through a variety of indirect sales channels  which include value added resellers  or vars  large account resellers  or lars  distributors  system integrators  or sis  and oems 
our enterprise customers include many leading global corporations  small and medium sized businesses  and many government agencies around the world 
some of our sales efforts are targeted to senior executives and it department personnel who are responsible for managing a company s it initiatives 
our primary method of demand generation for enterprise customers is through our direct sales force 
we ended fiscal with approximately  individuals in our sales and services team 
account managers are responsible for customer relationships and opportunity management and are supported by product and services specialists 
we complement our direct sales efforts with indirect sales channels such as resellers  vars  lars  distributors  and sis  primarily to address the small to medium sized enterprise market 
we sell our products through authorized distributors in more than countries throughout the world 
our top distributor during fiscal was ingram micro  inc another important element of our enterprise solutions strategy involves our relationships with oem partners that incorporate our products into their products  bundle our products with their products  or serve as authorized resellers of our products

customers our solutions are used worldwide by individual and enterprise customers in a wide variety of industries  small  medium and large enterprises  as well as various governmental entities 
in fiscal  and  one distributor  ingram micro  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
our distributor arrangements with ingram micro consist of several non exclusive  independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries  each of which cover different countries or regions 
each of these agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of any other contract such as a master distribution agreement  and these agreements are not based on the same form of contract 
none of these contracts was individually responsible for over percent of our total net revenues in each of the last three fiscal years 
in fiscal  and  one reseller  digital river  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
research and development research and development expenses  exclusive of in process research and development associated with acquisitions  were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development 

table of contents symantec embraces a global r d strategy with teams of engineers worldwide focused on product development  pure research and on tailoring our products to meet regional requirements 
conducting r d close to our customers ensures that we have intimate knowledge of the markets we serve and a better link between our customers and our labs 
symantec strives to maintain long term technological leadership by nurturing innovation  generating new ideas and developing next generation technologies across all of our business 
symantec research labs is a group designed to foster new technologies and products to help us maintain leadership in existing markets

the security response team is also focused on developing new technologies and approaches to protecting customers information and systems 
independent contractors are used for various aspects of the product development process 
in addition  elements of some of our products are licensed from third parties 
acquisitions our strategic technology acquisitions are designed to enhance the features and functionality of our existing products  as well as extend our product leadership 
we use strategic acquisitions to provide certain technology  people  and products for our overall product and services strategy 
we consider both time to market and potential market share gains when evaluating acquisitions of technologies  product lines  or companies 
we have completed a number of acquisitions of technologies  companies  and products in the past  and we have also disposed of technologies and products 
we may acquire and or dispose of other technologies  products and companies in the future 
during fiscal  we completed the following acquisitions company name company description date acquired altiris inc a provider of information technology management software that enables businesses to easily manage and service network based endpoints 
april  vontu  inc a provider of data loss prevention dlp solutions that assist organizations in preventing the loss of confidential or proprietary information 
november  transparent logic technologies  inc a provider of products that support business process automation and workflow 
january  in addition  on april   we acquired appstream inc  a provider of application streaming technology  an on demand delivery mechanism that leverages the power of application virtualization to enable greater flexibility and control 
for further discussion of our acquisitions  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
competition our markets are consolidating  are highly competitive  and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
we are focused on integrating next generation technology capabilities into our solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry also include  time to market  price  reputation  financial stability  breadth of product offerings  customer support  brand recognition  and effective sales and marketing efforts 

table of contents in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors  we face indirect or potential competition from retail  application providers  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers  and other oems  who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products 
we also compete for access to retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
in addition  we compete with other software companies  operating system providers  network equipment manufacturers and other oems to acquire technologies  products  or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
we also compete with other software companies in our effort to place our products on the computer equipment sold to consumers by oems 
the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below 
consumer products some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive 
our competitors are sometimes intensely focused on customer acquisition  which has led such competitors to offer their technology for free  engage in aggressive marketing  or enter into competitive partnerships 
our primary competitors in the consumer products segment are mcafee  inc  microsoft corporation  and trend micro inc 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
security and compliance in the security and compliance markets  we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our technology solutions and competing services to our response and support services 
our primary competitors in the security market are cisco systems  inc  mcafee  microsoft  and trend micro 
there are also several smaller regional security companies that we compete against primarily in the emea and apj regions 
storage and server management the markets for storage and server management are intensely competitive 
in the areas of data protection and storage and server management  our primary competitors are ca inc  commvault systems  inc  emc  inc  hewlett packard co  ibm corp  microsoft  oracle corp  and sun microsystems  inc services we believe that the principal competitive factors for our services segment include technical capability  customer responsiveness  and our ability to hire and retain talented and experienced services personnel 
our primary competitors in the services segment are emc  hewlett packard  ibm  and regional specialized consulting firms 
in the managed security services business  our primary competitors are ibm and verisign  inc intellectual property protective measures we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software  and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual arrangements  and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products  services  and technology and enhance our competitive position 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors  and corporate partners  and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
these license agreements are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities  equipment  and networks 

table of contents trademarks  patents  copyrights  and licenses symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries 
in addition to symantec and the symantec logo  we have used  registered  and or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark  and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country  and in the us we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 
we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices  and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad 
however  these measures may not provide sufficient protection  and our intellectual property rights may be challenged 
in addition  we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products  and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights 
while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success  we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent  trademark  license  or other intellectual property right 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters 
a significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met  and because a significant portion of our in period revenue is provided by the ratable recognition of our deferred revenue balance 
employees as of march   we employed more than  people worldwide  approximately percent of whom reside in the us approximately  employees work in sales and marketing   in research and development   in support and services  and  in management  manufacturing  and administration

item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
the list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance  or if we are unable to continually improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing products and services or adapt our business model to keep pace with industry trends  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have in the past incurred  and will continue to incur  significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive 
new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements  which has frequently been longer than we originally expected adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers extending the operation of our products and services to new platforms and operating systems entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience managing new product and service strategies  including integrating our various security and storage technologies  management solutions  customer service  and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions incorporating acquired products and technologies trade compliance issues affecting our ability to ship new products developing or expanding efficient sales channels obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products  including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems in addition  if we cannot adapt our business models to keep pace with industry trends  our revenue could be negatively impacted 
in connection with our enterprise software offerings  we license our applications on a variety of bases  such as per server  per processor  or based on performance criteria such as per amount of data processed or stored 
if enterprises continue to migrate towards solutions  such as virtualization  which allow enterprises to run multiple applications and operating systems on a single server and thereby reduce the number of servers they are required to own and operate  we may experience lower license revenues unless we are able to successfully change our enterprise licensing model or sell additional software to take into account the impact of these new solutions 
if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges  or if our new products  product upgrades  and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors  and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  competition  product obsolescence  technological change  shifts in buying patterns 
table of contents and budget constraints of our actual and potential customers  levels of broadband usage  awareness of security threats to it systems  and other factors 
while such factors may  in some periods  increase product sales  fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales 
if demand for our products declines  our revenues and gross margin could be adversely affected 
for example  if the challenging economic conditions in the united states or other key markets continue or deteriorate further  we may experience slower or negative revenue growth and our business and operating results might suffer 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets  our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenue that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
to compete successfully  we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services  effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors  appropriately respond to competitive strategies  and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed  used  and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets 
if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands  we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results 
our traditional competitors include independent software vendors that offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings 
in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end users of our products  we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps 
our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if they more actively promote our competitors products than our products 
in addition  software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 
we face growing competition from network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers 
these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 
another growing industry trend is the software as a service saas business model  whereby software vendors develop and host their applications for use by customers over the internet 
this allows enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed  internally operated software without the associated complexity or high initial set up and operational costs 
advances in the saas business model could enable the growth of our competitors and could affect the success of our traditional software licensing models 
we have recently released our own saas offerings 
however  it is uncertain whether our saas strategy will prove successful or whether we will be able to successfully incorporate our saas offering into our current licensing models 
our inability to successfully develop and market saas product offerings could cause us to lose business to competitors 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  or other resources than we do and consequently may have the ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours 
we also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 

table of contents if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers around the world through multi tiered sales and distribution networks 
sales through these different channels involve distinct risks  including the following direct sales 
a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end users 
special risks associated with this sales channel include longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts difficulty in hiring  retaining  and motivating our direct sales force substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive  including regular updates to cover new and revised products indirect sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels  including distributors that sell our products to end users and other resellers 
this channel involves a number of risks  including our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end users our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may  from time to time  place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing  promotions  and other terms offered by our competitors oem sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into  or bundle our products with  their products 
our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks  including our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems shipped our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due  among other things  to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain partners sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in strategic direction  competitive risks  and other issues that could result in reduction of oem sales the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no associated revenues the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market our oem partners may develop  market  and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors  which could reduce our sales if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully  these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 
some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past  and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future  we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  reliance on multiple channels subjects us to 
table of contents events that could cause unpredictability in demand  which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future  and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 
we have in the past acquired  and we expect to acquire in the future  other businesses  business units  and technologies 
acquisitions can involve a number of special risks and challenges  including complexity  time  and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations  workforce  products  and technologies into our existing business  sales force  employee base  product lines  and technology diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities loss or termination of employees  including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related to the acquired business the addition of acquisition related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses  write off of in process research and development  impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  and stock based compensation expense integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming  and expensive process  and can impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if integration of our acquired businesses is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of an acquisition or undergo other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests  and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other factors  could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
in addition  because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we have not historically maintained substantial levels of indebtedness  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liabilities 
in june  we sold billion in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
as a result of the sale of the notes  we have a substantially greater amount of long term debt than we have maintained in the past 
in addition  we have entered into a credit facility with a borrowing capacity of billion and we borrowed million under the facility in november to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of vontu  inc our credit facility allows us immediate access to an additional million of domestic funds if we identify opportunities for its use 
from time to time in the future  we may also incur indebtedness in addition to the amount available under our credit facility 
our maintenance of substantial levels of debt could adversely affect our flexibility to take advantage of certain corporate opportunities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support  and production 
we plan to expand our international operations  but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities 
our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations  including potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than us laws requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations regulations or restrictions on the use  import  or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation that could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages political unrest  war  or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
the level of corporate tax from sales to our non us customers is less than the level of tax from sales to our us customers 
this benefit is contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures  or bugs may occur  especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are often installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software  and equipment and 
table of contents networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures  or bugs in our products 
our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
in addition  despite testing by us and others  errors  failures  or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures  and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and  in some cases  may have experienced delayed or lost revenues as a result of these errors 
errors  failures  or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position  or claims by customers or others 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions  delays  or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees  lose key personnel  fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  or fail to manage our employee base effectively  we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services  effectively manage or expand our business  or increase our revenues 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain our key management  technical  sales  marketing  finance  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant 
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package  including cash and equity based compensation 
the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans  and recent changes in accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity based compensation as compensation expense 
as a result  we may decide to issue fewer equity based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 
we are a party to several class action lawsuits  which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses  and which could  if not determined favorably  negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have been named as a party to class action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation 
the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business  results of operations  and cash flows 

table of contents third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including claims regarding patents  copyrights  and trademarks 
in addition  former employers of our former  current  or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and distract management from day to day operations 
if we are not successful in defending such claims  we could be required to stop selling  delay shipments of  or redesign our products  pay monetary amounts as damages  enter into royalty or licensing arrangements  or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all  and may expose us to additional liability 
this liability  or our inability to use any of this third party software  could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology  our financial results could be harmed 
most of our software and underlying technology is proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws 
however  all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by third parties 
third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain  use  distribute  and sell our proprietary information without authorization 
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently by designing around our patents 
our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products 
any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software  operating system  and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor  or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers 
in addition  any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in  alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa  or the software information industry association siia  could be costly  may distract management from day to day operations  and may lead to additional claims against us  which could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our products contain open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so called open source licenses  which may include  by way of example  the gnu general public license gpl  gnu lesser general public license lgpl  the mozilla public license  the bsd license  and the apache license 
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software  and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use 
if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner  we could  under certain of the open source licenses  be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software 
we have established processes to help alleviate these risks  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source  but we cannot be sure that all 
table of contents open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
in addition  many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated  and could  if not properly addressed  negatively affect our business 
our software products and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
our activities could be adversely affected and our reputation and future sales harmed if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
our financial results have been in the past  and may continue to be in the future  materially affected by non cash and other accounting charges  including amortization of intangible assets  including acquired product rights impairment of goodwill stock based compensation expense restructuring charges impairment of long lived assets loss on sale of a business and similar write downs of assets held for sale for example  in connection with our acquisition of veritas  we have recorded approximately billion of acquired product rights and other intangible assets and billion of goodwill 
we have recorded and will continue to record future amortization charges with respect to a portion of these intangible assets and stock based compensation expense related to the stock options to purchase veritas common stock assumed by us 
in addition  we will evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant  and our evaluation depends to a large degree on estimates and assumptions made by our management 
our assessment of any impairment of goodwill is based on a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of that reporting unit 
our determination of fair value relies on management s assumptions of our future revenues  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions such as the discount rate 
table of contents applied to future operating results  the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 
our effective tax rate may increase  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods tax assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place 
the price of our common stock could decline if our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority  and we are regularly engaged in discussions  and sometimes disputes  with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
factors associated with our industry  the operation of our business  and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including reduced demand for any of our products entry of new competition into our markets competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of products our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our products the number  severity  and timing of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter 
table of contents enterprise customers tendency to negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter cancellation  deferral  or limitation of orders by customers fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movement in interest rates the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services political and military instability  which could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles  and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively budgetary constraints of customers  which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives disruptions in our business operations or target markets caused by  among other things  earthquakes  floods  or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley  california  an area known for seismic activity  or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism intentional disruptions by third parties health or similar issues  such as a pandemic any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  and as a result you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts rumors  announcements  or press articles regarding our or our competitors operations  management  organization  financial condition  or financial statements changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us  our investors  or securities analysts accounting charges  including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill announcements of planned acquisitions or dispositions by us or by our competitors announcements of new or planned products by us  our competitors  or our customers gain or loss of a significant customer inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies acts of terrorism  the threat of war  and other crises or emergency situations economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business symantec is a global leader in providing security  storage and systems management solutions to help businesses and consumers secure and manage their information 
we provide customers worldwide with software and services that protect  manage and control information risks related to security  data protection  storage  compliance  and systems management 
we help our customers manage cost  complexity and compliance by protecting their it infrastructure as they seek to maximize value from their it investments 
we have a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march unless otherwise stated  references to fiscal years in this report relate to fiscal year and periods ended march   march  and march  our fiscal year will consist of weeks and will end on april  
table of contents on april   we completed our acquisition of altiris inc  a leading provider of it management software that enables businesses to easily manage and service network based endpoints 
we used approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents to fund the acquisition  which amount was net of altiris cash and cash equivalents balance 
we believe this acquisition enables us to help customers better manage and enforce security policies at the endpoint  identify and protect against threats  and repair and service assets 
on november   we completed our acquisition of vontu  inc vontu  a provider of data loss prevention dlp solutions that assists organizations in preventing the loss of confidential or proprietary information  for approximately million in cash  which amount was net of vontu s cash and cash equivalents balance 
on november   we borrowed million under our five year billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility to partially finance this acquisition 
in february  we contributed million in cash to our joint venture with huawei technologies co  ltd 
in exchange for a interest in the joint venture 
the joint venture will develop  manufacture  market and support security and storage appliances to global telecommunications carriers and enterprise customers 
our operating segments our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services  distinguished by customer needs 
during the march quarter  we modified the segment reporting structure in line with business operational changes associated with enrique salem s promotion to chief operating officer in january the following changes have been made to our segment reporting structure the security and data management segment was renamed the security and compliance segment  the altiris segment  in its entirety  has been moved into the security and compliance segment  the data center management segment was renamed the storage and server management segment  and the backup exec products were moved from the security and data management segment to the storage and server management segment 
as a result of these changes  we now operate in five operating segments security and compliance  storage and server management  consumer products  services  and other 
the new business structure more directly aligns the operating segments with markets and customers  and we believe will establish more direct lines of reporting responsibilities  speed decision making  and enhance the ability to pursue strategic growth opportunities 
all financial information from periods prior to these changes in reportable segments contained in this annual report has been recast  where appropriate  in this annual report to reflect the revised segment reporting structure noted above 
for further descriptions of our operating segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments 
financial results and trends our net income was million for fiscal as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the higher net income for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal as well as a net gain from settlements of litigation of million in fiscal for which there was no corresponding gain in fiscal our net income for fiscal was partially offset by higher operating expenses  including a loss on sale of a business of million related to the disposition of our apm business  for which there is no corresponding charge in fiscal the higher net income for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the write off in fiscal of million of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  as a result of the veritas acquisition for which there is no comparable charge in fiscal this increase was partially offset by million of stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  effective april   higher employee compensation costs resulting from increased employee headcount  and million of restructuring charges compared to million in fiscal revenue for fiscal was billion  or  higher than revenue for fiscal for fiscal we realized revenue growth across all of our geographic regions as compared to fiscal and fiscal and experienced revenue growth in all of our segments 
foreign currency fluctuations positively impacted our 
table of contents international revenue growth in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  foreign currency fluctuations also positively impacted our revenue growth internationally compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
in addition  our april acquisition of altiris contributed million to our revenue increase from fiscal to fiscal our deferred revenue at march  was higher than at the corresponding amount as of march  increased sales related to some of our enterprise products and the depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies drove the increase in deferred revenue realized for the year ended march  in recent periods  the percentage of our in period revenue that has resulted from the amortization of our deferred revenue balance has been increasing  and we believe this trend has normalized as we are over twelve months into the transition of combining our buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings 
the factors contributing to the growth in revenue and deferred revenue are discussed more fully in results of operations below 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a cost savings initiative  which included a workforce reduction of approximately worldwide 
we have fully implemented this cost savings initiative in fiscal in the december quarter  we implemented another restructuring plan to continue our focus on controlling costs 
these cost savings initiatives resulted in restructuring charges totaling million for the year ended march  and we expect to incur additional charges during fiscal year as a result of this plan 
our gross margins and operating expenses were affected during fiscal as a result of recent changes in the terms of some of our relationships with key original equipment manufacturers oems 
we have negotiated new contract terms with some of our oem partners  which have resulted in some payments to oem partners being included in our consolidated statements of income as operating expenses rather than cost of revenues 
in general  payments to oems made on a placement fee per unit basis will be treated as operating expenses  while payments based on a revenue sharing model will be amortized as cost of revenues 
the increase in operating expenses will more than offset the decrease in cost of revenues because placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis  while revenue sharing arrangements are generally amortized ratably over a one year period  and because payments to oems increased 
these recent changes have largely been in effect for fiscal and we do not expect the trend relating to placement fees increasing operating expense and decreasing cost of revenues to continue 
cash flows were strong in fiscal as we achieved billion in operating cash flow 
we ended fiscal with billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
in addition  during fiscal we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price of  for total consideration of billion 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the operating results or financial condition 
we believe that the estimates 
table of contents described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
we recognize revenue primarily pursuant to the requirements of statement of position  software revenue recognition  and any applicable amendments or modifications 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance  consumer product content updates  and arrangements where vsoe does not exist 
deferred revenue totaled approximately billion as of march   of which million was classified as long term deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and increasing flexibility in contractual arrangements could materially impact the amount recognized in the current period and deferred over time 
for our consumer products that include content updates  we recognize revenue and the associated cost of revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users 
we recognize deferred revenue and inventory for the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 
we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand  which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends 
we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on valid purchase orders 
our distributors and resellers base the quantity of orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand  which may exceed the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is above the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with statement of financial standard sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level 
because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned  we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 
reserves for product returns 
we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to deferred revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
more or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 
reserves for rebates 
we estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue 
for consumer products that include content updates  rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider 
table of contents current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
goodwill 
at march   goodwill was billion  other intangible assets  net were billion  and acquired product rights  net were million 
we assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life for impairment within our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with our reportable segments 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the equity assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the equity assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the excess 
to determine the reporting units fair value in the current year evaluation  we use the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  growth rates and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets according to sfas whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
during fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million primarily for the write down of intangible assets related to the sale of our application performance management business 
long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment charges on long lived assets to be held and 
table of contents used when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of long lived assets based on a projected undiscounted cash flow method using assumptions determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many triggering factors which could change and cause a material impact to our operating results or financial condition 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million for our newport news  va building held for sale 
acquired product rights 
we account for acquired product rights in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we record impairment charges on acquired product rights when we determine that the net realizable value of the assets may not be recoverable 
to determine the net realizable value of the assets  we use the estimated future gross revenues from each product 
our estimated future gross revenues of each product are based on company forecasts and are subject to change 
during fiscal  we did not have any indications of impairment 
restructuring we have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating  moving  and relocating personnel or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions 
in determining our estimates  we obtain information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sublessee 
market conditions may affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may affect our accrual for site closures 
in addition  differences between estimated and actual related broker commissions  tenant improvements  and other exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs  the amount recorded for any new period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 
stock based compensation effective april   we adopted the provisions of  and accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  we must measure the fair value of all stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units  or rsus  and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  on the date of grant and amortize the fair value of the award over the requisite service period 
we elected the modified prospective application method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
for stock based awards granted on or after april   we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we also recognize estimated compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards that were outstanding as of the effective date on a straight line basis over the remaining service period using the compensation costs estimated for the sfas no 
pro forma disclosures 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the option 
expected volatility is based on the average of historical volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the risk free interest rate is equal to the us treasury constant maturity rates for the period equal to the expected life 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual 
table of contents forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures of stock options  rsus  and espp purchase rights at the time of grant based on historical experience and record compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the amount of such expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options  rsus  and employee stock purchases recognized under sfas no 
r for the year ended march  was million 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes from a potential claim or legal proceeding  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable 
a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required  if any  for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each separate matter 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  we base our estimates on the information available at the time of our assessment 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our operating results and financial position 
as of march   we recognized a loss for the pending settlement of a class action lawsuit related to a pre acquisition contingency of veritas for million 
the amount was determined based upon existing facts and circumstances of the outcome and estimates that we could reasonably and likely pay 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
we are required to compute our income taxes in each federal  state  and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences 
table of contents between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income  or to goodwill to the extent that the valuation allowance related to tax attributes of the acquired entities 
we failed to file in a timely fashion the final pre acquisition tax return for veritas  and as a result  it is uncertain whether we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a veritas foreign subsidiary under the american jobs creation act of we are currently petitioning the irs for relief to allow us to claim the lower rate of tax 
because we were unable to obtain this relief prior to filing the veritas tax return in may  we have paid million of additional us taxes 
the potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this amount include if we ultimately obtain relief from the irs on this matter  the million that we paid in may may be refunded to us and we will use that amount to increase our income tax accrual for the veritas transfer pricing disputes 
for more information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
if we ultimately do not receive relief from the irs on this matter  and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the veritas transfer pricing disputes  then we would only owe additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that such adjustment is in excess of million 
if we ultimately do not receive relief from the irs on this matter  and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from the veritas transfer pricing disputes  then we would be required to adjust the purchase price of veritas to reflect a reduction in the amount of pre acquisition tax liabilities assumed  and we would be required to recognize an equal amount of income tax expense  up to million

table of contents results of operations total net revenues fiscal in thousands net revenues period over period change net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher amortization of deferred revenue as a result of the higher amount of deferred revenue at the beginning of the fiscal period than at the beginning of the fiscal period and increased sales related to our backup exec  storage foundation  and net backup products 
our total deferred revenue grew from billion to billion in fiscal and grew from billion to billion in fiscal the higher deferred revenue balance at the beginning of fiscal is due to a greater portion of the revenue from transactions being subject to deferral since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal than was the case in prior periods as discussed below 
in addition  we realized million due to the new sales of products from our april  acquisition of altiris for which there is no comparable revenue in the same prior year period and a favorable foreign currency impact in fiscal as compared to fiscal as noted above  we realized an increase in recognized revenue from deferred revenue in fiscal this increase in deferred revenue resulted from combining our buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings  negotiating more transactions that commit customers to multi year periods  offering more flexibility in contractual terms and in product deployments  and providing more services in combination with license and maintenance sales 
in the december quarter  we combined our buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings to provide our customers and partners a single vendor relationship and simplify the way we do business 
previously  our storage and availability products and services were sold under veritas pre merger buying programs  while our security products and services were sold under our historical buying programs 
the combination of buying programs resulted in a change in the vsoe for some of our storage and availability products and services 
this change  coupled with an increased number of maintenance renewals sold with a license component  resulted in a larger portion of revenues associated with contracts being classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  which is subject to deferral  instead of licenses revenue  which is generally recognized immediately 
these factors resulted in lower recognized revenue growth rates in the first six months of fiscal and in fiscal some of our customers have also requested increased flexibility in product deployments in site license arrangements 
this may result in an increase in deferred revenue and classification of all revenues associated with the specific contract as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  which is recognized over time  as vsoe may not exist in certain types of flexible deployment contracts 
as a result of our initiative to offer customers a more comprehensive solution to protect and manage a global it infrastructure  we have seen an increasing amount of services sold in conjunction with license and maintenance contracts 
inclusion of such services often results in increased deferred revenue and increased classification of revenues as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  as vsoe may not exist for some of the services provided 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the new sales of the storage and availability products and services from our july acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
we were required under purchase accounting rules to reduce the amount of veritas deferred revenue that we recorded in connection with the acquisition of veritas to an amount equal to the fair value of our contractual obligation related to that deferred revenue 
unless otherwise specified  storage and availability products and services include products and services obtained through our acquisition of veritas  and complementary products and services obtained or developed subsequent to such acquisition 
these products and services contributed million of net revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
the remainder of the revenue increase is due to 
table of contents increases in our consumer products revenue and services offerings of million and million  respectively  due to continued growth in demand 
the segment discussions that follow further describe the revenue increases 
these increases are partially offset by the effects of the increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs discussed above 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues fiscal in thousands content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period change beginning with the release of our consumer products that include content updates in the december quarter  we recognize revenue related to these products ratably 
as a result  this revenue has been classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance beginning in the december quarter 
in addition  as noted above  increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs in the december quarter have impacted revenue recognition 
these changes caused a larger portion of revenue associated with contracts to be classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  which is subject to deferral  instead of licenses revenue  which is generally recognized immediately  as discussed above in total net revenues 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in revenue related to enterprise products and services  excluding acquired altiris products 
this increase in enterprise product and services revenue was largely attributable to higher amortization of deferred revenue  for the reasons discussed above in total net revenues 
in addition  content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues increased million from new sales of products from our acquisition of altiris for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period 
the increase is also due to a favorable foreign currency impact 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the new sales of the storage and availability products and services from our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products and services contributed million of content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition  in fiscal  content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue related to our enterprise products increased million due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the comparable period was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under total net revenues above 
revenue related to our consumer products increased million as compared to the period due primarily to growth in norton internet security products and online revenues due to growth in the use of the internet  and increased awareness and sophistication of security threats 
enterprise products and services  excluding veritas related products and services  increased million as a result of growth in our maintenance renewals due to an increasing installed base  increased demand for our service offerings  other acquisitions  and the combination of our buying programs implemented in the december quarter  which impacted our vsoe methodology and classification of licenses revenue and content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue  as discussed above under total net revenues 

table of contents licenses revenue fiscal in thousands licenses revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period change licenses revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million from new sales of products from our acquisition of altiris for which there is no comparable revenue in the prior period and a favorable foreign currency impact 
this increase is offset by a decrease in license revenues from the security and compliance and storage and server management segments of million excluding acquired altiris products  which mitigated the decline in license revenues from those products  as a result of increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs in the december quarter  causing a larger portion of revenue associated with contracts to be classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue instead of licenses revenue during the first half of fiscal licenses revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the storage and availability products obtained through our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products contributed million of licenses revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
excluding this june contribution  license revenues were down in both security and data management and data center management segments as a result of the increased flexibility in contract terms and the combination of our buying programs implemented in the december quarter  both of which caused a larger portion of contracts to be classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance  which is subject to deferral  instead of licenses revenue  which is generally recognized immediately  as discussed above in total net revenues 
net revenues and operating income by segment consumer products segment fiscal in thousands consumer products revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period change consumer products operating income percentage of consumer products revenues period over period change consumer products revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an aggregate increase of million in revenue from our norton internet security and norton products 
these increases are due to the increase in demand for these products during both fiscal and fiscal  as the revenue from our consumer products is generally recognized ratably over the months after the product is sold 
these increases are partially offset by aggregate decreases of million in revenue from our norton antivirus and norton system works products 
this decrease results from our customers continued migration to our norton internet security product and our new norton product  which offer broader protection and backup features to address the rapidly changing threat environment 
our electronic orders include sales derived from oems  subscriptions  upgrades  online sales  and renewals 
revenue from electronic orders which includes sales of the aforementioned products

security and compliance revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to new sales of our enterprise vault product  which was acquired with veritas  for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
this product contributed million of revenue in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition the purchase accounting adjustment  discussed under total net revenues above  contributed million cumulatively in the september  december  and march quarters as compared to the comparable quarters of the prior year 
in addition  revenues increased million in fiscal as a result of acquisitions  excluding veritas  for which there was not a full twelve months of revenue or no comparable revenue in fiscal total expenses from our security and compliance segment increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily a result of higher salary and commissions which includes the impact of the fiscal altiris and vontu acquisitions

storage and server management revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to new sales of storage and availability products from our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve month period compared to nine months in the fiscal period 
these products contributed million of revenue in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under total net revenues above also contributed million to the increase in revenue in fiscal excluding the effects of the aforementioned items  revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was relatively flat due to the combination of the buying programs for all of our enterprise offerings in the december quarter 
this combination resulted in lower recognized revenue and increased deferred revenue as discussed under total net revenues above

foreign currencies had a favorable impact on net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal international revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to new sales of storage and availability products and services from our acquisition of veritas for the full twelve months in the period compared to nine months in the period 
these products and services contributed million of international revenues in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in the americas  these products contributed million in the june quarter for which there was no comparable revenue in the june quarter 
in addition  a portion of the revenue increase in fiscal is due to the fact that the amount of revenue recognized in the comparable period was lower as a result of the purchase accounting adjustment discussed under total net revenues above 
the purchase accounting adjustment increased fiscal revenues by million in the americas and million in the international regions compared to fiscal growth in our consumer products segment  driven by norton internet security  resulted in a million increase in the international regions and a million increase in the americas in fiscal revenues versus fiscal both domestic and international revenue from enterprise offerings were negatively impacted primarily due to the increased flexibility in our contract terms and the combination of our buying programs 
these changes resulted in a larger portion of contracts being subject to deferral and a correspondingly lower amount of revenue recognized in the current period  as discussed in total net revenues above 
foreign currencies had a favorable impact on net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
cost of revenues fiscal in thousands cost of revenues gross margin period over period change cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired product rights  fee based technical support costs  costs of billable services  payments to oems under revenue sharing arrangements  manufacturing and direct material costs  and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements 

table of contents gross margin increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase in revenue and the fact that the terms of several of our oem arrangements changed from revenue sharing arrangements to placement fee arrangements in late fiscal placement fee arrangements are expensed on an estimated average cost basis  while revenue sharing arrangements are generally amortized ratably over a one year period 
in addition  we realized year over year increases in services and technical support costs 
cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance fiscal in thousands cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance as a percentage of related revenue period over period change cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs  costs of billable services  and payments to oems under revenue sharing agreements 
cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal the year over year decrease in cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance as a percentage of the related revenue is primarily driven by higher revenues and lower oem royalties as a percentage of revenue more than offsetting increases in services expenses 
we expect the impact of moving many of our oem payments from cost of revenues to operating expenses to be reduced in future periods as the change had been in effect for most of fiscal our past oem payments were primarily revenue sharing arrangements  which were generally amortized to cost of revenues over a one year period 
several of the arrangements negotiated in late fiscal are placement fee arrangements  for which the costs are expensed on an estimated average cost basis and classified as operating expenses 
cost of licenses fiscal in thousands cost of licenses as a percentage of related revenue period over period change cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing and direct material costs 
cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal the year over year decrease in cost of licenses as a percentage of the related revenue is primarily attributable to higher revenues and to a lesser extent due to lower obsolescence reserves 
fiscal had relatively high obsolescence reserves due to the company s decision to exit certain aspects of the appliance business 

table of contents amortization of acquired product rights fiscal in thousands amortization of acquired product rights percentage of total net revenues period over period change acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies and patents from acquired companies 
the amortization in fiscal was higher than fiscal primarily due to amortization associated with the altiris acquisition  offset in part by certain acquired product rights becoming fully amortized

operating expenses sales and marketing expense fiscal in thousands sales and marketing percentage of total net revenues period over period change sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to higher employee compensation expense as a result of the altiris and vontu acquisitions and the oem placement fees as discussed above under financial results and trends 
we negotiated new contract terms with some of our oem partners in fiscal  for which the expense commenced being recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  these new contract terms had the effect of moving our oem payments from cost of revenues to operating expenses 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the percentage increase and increase in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to higher employee compensation expense of approximately million resulting from an increase in employee headcount 
higher employee compensation expense includes the effect of adopting of sfas no 
r  which added million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal for which there is no comparable expense in fiscal in addition  approximately million of the increase is due to an additional three months of sales and marketing expenses related to the veritas acquisition  which is included for the full year of fiscal as compared to nine months in fiscal advertising expense increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of changes in our oem arrangements

the increased amortization in fiscal is primarily associated with a full year of amortization of intangible assets associated with the altiris purchase which occurred in april the increased amortization in fiscal is primarily associated with a full year of amortization associated with the veritas acquisition which occurred in july and the acquisitions of company i limited and frontsecurity  inc that occurred during fiscal for further discussion of other intangible assets from acquisitions and related amortization  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
acquired in process research and development ipr d during fiscal  we wrote off ipr d totaling million  of which million was in connection with our acquisition of veritas 
the ipr d was written off because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to 
table of contents completion of a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
at the time of the acquisition in july  veritas was developing new products in multiple product areas that qualify as ipr d 
these efforts included netbackup  backup exec  server management  and various other projects 
at the time of the acquisition  it was estimated that these ipr d development efforts would be completed over the following to months at an estimated total cost of million 
as of march   all ipr d projects had been completed on schedule and within expected costs 
restructuring fiscal in thousands restructuring percentage of total net revenues period over period change in fiscal  we approved and initiated a restructuring plan plan to reduce costs  implement management structure changes and optimize the business structure and discontinue certain products 
projects within the plan began in the third quarter of and are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of total remaining costs of the restructuring plan  consisting of severance and benefits and excess facilities costs  are estimated to range between approximately million and million 
in fiscal  we entered into restructuring plans plans to consolidate facilities and reduce operating costs through headcount reductions 
we also consolidated certain facilities and exited facilities as a result of earlier acquisitions 
in fiscal  we entered into restructuring plans plans to reduce job redundancy in the americas  emea and asia pacific japan and to consolidate certain facilities in europe and asia 
future severance and benefit costs and facilities charges for both the plans and plans are not expected to be significant 
we recognized million in restructuring charges in fiscal compared to million in fiscal charges in fiscal were million of severance and benefit costs and million for contract termination costs for exited facilities 
in fiscal  severance and benefit costs of million related to the plan and million related to the plans 
in addition  facilities contract termination costs of million related to the plans and million were acquisition related charges for altiris and vontu that occurred in fiscal in fiscal  severance and benefit costs of million and an insignificant amount for facilities termination costs for the plans 
included in the million for severance and benefit costs were million which were acquisition related charges for veritas and others that occurred in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized million of severance and benefit costs and million for contract termination costs for exited facilities were recognized 
integration in fiscal  we recorded million of integration charges in connection with our april acquisition of altiris 
these integration charges consisted of costs incurred for consulting services and other professional fees 
in connection with our acquisition of veritas  we recorded integration costs of million in fiscal  which consisted primarily of costs incurred for consulting services and other professional fees 

table of contents non operating income and expense fiscal in thousands interest income interest expense settlements of litigation  net other income expense  net total percentage of total net revenues period over period change the decrease in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to lower average interest rates and a lower average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
the increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a higher average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and higher average interest rates realized on those balances 
interest expense in fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to the interest and amortization of issuance costs related to our and convertible senior notes issued in june fiscal also includes interest and accretion related to the convertible subordinated notes that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of veritas 
the veritas convertible subordinated notes were paid in full during august interest expense in fiscal was due primarily to the veritas convertible subordinated notes

the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of non deductible stock based compensation offset by us tax benefits from domestic manufacturing deductions 
the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of non deductible stock based compensation offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of the ipr d charges and other acquisition related charges that are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes  partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate  and the effect of the true up of taxes on repatriated earnings 
we believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax assets as of march  of million  after application of the valuation allowance  is more likely than not based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences 
realization of approximately million of our deferred tax assets as of march  is dependent upon future taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in item a  risk factors  set forth 
table of contents in this annual report 
an additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
of the million total valuation allowance provided against our deferred tax assets  approximately million is attributable to acquisition related assets  the benefit of which will reduce goodwill when and if realized 
the valuation allowance decreased by million in fiscal  million was reclassified as fin reserves  million was attributable to acquisition related assets 
american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings in the march quarter  we repatriated million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the dividends received deduction under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs act  enacted in october in may  clarifying language was issued by the us department of treasury and the irs with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated under the jobs act and in september  additional clarifying language was issued regarding the treatment of certain deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation 
as a result of this clarifying language  we reduced the tax expense attributable to the repatriation by approximately million in fiscal other tax matters on march   we received a notice of deficiency from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes  plus interest and penalties  for the and tax years based on an audit of veritas 
the incremental tax liability asserted by the irs was million  excluding penalties and interest 
on june   we filed a petition with the us tax court protesting the irs claim for such additional taxes 
on august   the irs answered our petition and this issue has been docketed for trial in us tax court and is scheduled to begin on june  in the march quarter  we agreed to pay million out of million originally assessed by the irs in connection with several of the lesser issues covered in the assessment 
the irs has also agreed to waive the assessment of penalties 
in a motion to amend filed march   the irs moved to change its position on the remaining issue in the case 
if allowed  the irs new position would decrease the incremental tax liability for the remaining issue to approximately million  excluding interest 
we strongly believe the irs position with regard to this matter is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations  and that our previously reported income tax provision for the years in question is appropriate 
no payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is definitively resolved 
if  upon resolution  we are required to pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter  the incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as additions to the cost of the veritas purchase price 
any incremental interest accrued subsequent to the date of the veritas acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the matter is resolved 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made million of tax related adjustments to the purchase accounting for veritas  consisting of million of additional pre acquisition tax reserve related adjustments  partially offset by a million reduction in other pre acquisition taxes payable 
while we strongly disagree with the irs over both its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the assessment  we have established additional tax reserves for all veritas pre acquisition years to account for both contingent tax and interest risk 
on march   we received notices of proposed adjustment from the irs with regard to an unrelated audit of symantec for fiscal and the irs claimed that we owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of million  excluding penalties and interest 
the incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing matters between symantec and a foreign subsidiary 
on september   we executed a closing agreement with the irs with respect to the audit of symantec s fiscal and federal income tax returns 
the closing agreement represents the final assessment by the irs of additional tax for these fiscal years of approximately million  including interest 
based on the final settlement  a tax benefit of million was recognized 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our tax reserves by an additional million in connection with all open symantec tax years fiscal to 
since these reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology  the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes 

table of contents we are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the acquisition 
the distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the jobs act  and therefore eligible for a effective us federal rate of tax  in lieu of the statutory rate 
we are seeking a ruling from the irs on the matter 
because we were unable to obtain this ruling prior to filing the veritas tax return in may  we have paid million of additional us taxes 
since this payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are otherwise the subject of the irs assessment  this additional payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of the purchase accounting for pre acquisition contingent tax risks 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report and critical accounting estimates income taxes above 
in connection with the note hedge transactions discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report  we established a deferred tax asset of approximately million to account for the book tax basis difference in the convertible notes resulting from note hedge transactions 
the deferred tax asset has been accounted for as an increase to capital in excess of par value 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective march  fin addresses the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in income tax positions  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to satisfy before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin was a decrease in tax reserves of million  resulting in a decrease in veritas goodwill of million  an increase of million to retained earnings balance  and a million increase in capital in excess of par value 
upon adoption  the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at march  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
liquidity and capital resources sources of cash we have historically relied primarily on cash flow from operations  borrowings under a credit facility  issuances of convertible notes and equity securities for our liquidity needs 
key sources of cash include earnings from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and our revolving credit facility 
in july  we entered into a five year billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in july during fiscal  we borrowed million under the credit facility 
in order to maintain availability to draw on the credit facility  we must maintain certain covenants  including a specified ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization as defined as well as various other non financial covenants 
as of march   we were in compliance with these covenants 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of billion and short term investments of million resulting in a net liquidity position unused availability of the credit facility  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of billion 
we believe that our cash balances  cash that we generate over time from operations  and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
uses of cash our principal cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures  payments of principal and interest on our debt and payments of taxes 
in addition  we regularly evaluate our ability to repurchase stock  pay debts and acquire other businesses 
acquisition related 
we generally use cash to fund the acquisition of other businesses and from time to time use our revolving credit facility when necessary

as a result  the company recorded a long term liability reflecting the net present value of expected future royalty payments due to mr 
norton 
at march   we reflected million in long term taxes payable related to uncertain tax benefits 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond the next twelve months due to uncertainties in the timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies

indemnification as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have directors and officers insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
we provide limited product warranties and the majority of our software license agreements contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  payments made under these provisions have been immaterial 
we monitor the conditions that are subject to indemnification to identify if a loss has occurred

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in currencies through our worldwide operations and  as such  we are exposed to foreign currency exposure risk 
foreign currency risks are associated with our cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates will result in foreign exchange gains and losses on these foreign currency assets and liabilities and are included in other income expense  net

our strategy is to primarily utilize forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures 
under our program  gains and losses in our foreign currency exposures are offset by losses and gains on our forward contracts 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
at the end of the reporting period  open contracts are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses included in other income expense  net
