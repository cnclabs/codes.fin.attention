table of contents risk management overview through our corporate governance structure  risk and return is evaluated to produce sustainable revenues  reduce risks of earning volatility and increase stockholder value 
the financial services industry is exposed to four major risks  liquidity  credit  market and operational 
liquidity risk is the inability to meet liability maturities and withdrawals  fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates

compliance to regulatory guidelines plays a significant role in risk management as well as corporate culture and the actions of management 
our code of ethics provides the guidelines for all employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of service to our clients 

table of contents liquidity risk management liquidity risk liquidity risk is the inability to meet liability maturities and withdrawals  fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates 
liquidity management involves maintaining ample and diverse funding capacity  liquid assets and other sources of cash to accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to business shocks or unanticipated events 
alco is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy and the accounting department is responsible for planning and executing the funding activities and strategies 
asset liquidity sources consist of the repayments and maturities of loans  selling of loans  short term money market investments  maturities and sales of securities from the available for sale security portfolio 
increased available for sale security balances were responsible for the major use of liquidity  followed by growth in the loan portfolio 
the weighted average life of the available for sale security portfolio is years 
liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and federal home loan bank borrowings 
we emphasize preserving and maximizing customer deposits and other customer based funding sources 
deposit marketing strategies are reviewed for consistency with liquidity policy objectives 
the company also had available correspondent banking lines of credit through correspondent relationships totaling approximately million and available secured borrowing lines of approximately million with the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
while these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of liquidity in the future  their mix  as well as the possible use of other sources  will depend on future economic and market conditions 
liquidity is also provided or used through the results of the company s operations 
the company s liquid assets cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and available for sale securities totaled million or of total assets at december   million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  in  the holding company s primary source of funding was exercises of stock options and dividends 
the holding company expects to receive dividends from the bank in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the restrictions on the bank s ability to pay dividends 
to accommodate future growth and business needs  the company develops an annual capital expenditure budget during strategic planning sessions 
the company expects that the earnings of the company  acquisition of core deposits and wholesale borrowing arrangements are sufficient to support liquidity needs in federal home loan bank borrowings the company actively uses federal home loan bank fhlb advances as a source of wholesale funding to provide liquidity 
at december   the company s fhlb long term advance was fixed rate tied to prime index minus a spread 
at december  the company s fhlb short term advances were a fixed term borrowing without call or put features  fixed or floating rates 
at december  the company had million in fhlb advances outstanding compared to million at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase with weighted average interest rates of  and at december   and  respectively federal home loan bank borrowings with weighted average interest rates of  and at december   and  respectively total short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase maximum outstanding at any month end average balance during the year 
table of contents weighted average interest rate during year federal home loan bank borrowings maximum outstanding at any month end average balance during the year weighted average interest rate during year credit risk management credit risk arises from the inability of a customer to meet its repayment obligations 
credit risk exists in our outstanding loans  letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments 
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower  repayment sources and the nature of underlying collateral given current events and conditions 
commercial portfolio credit risk management commercial credit risk management begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the individual borrower based on an analysis of the borrower s financial position in light of current industry  economic or geopolitical trends 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower  each commercial credit is assigned a risk grade and is subject to approval based on existing credit approval standards 
risk grading is a factor in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
credit decisions are determined by credit administration to certain limitations and approvals from the loan committee above certain limitations 
credit risk is continuously monitored by credit administration for possible adjustment if there has been a change in the borrower s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we manage the size of our credit exposure through loan sales and loan participation agreements 
the primary sources of repayment of the commercial loans of the company are from the borrower s operating cash flows and the borrowers conversion of short term assets to cash 
the net assets of the borrower or guarantor are usually identified as a secondary source of repayment 
the principal factors affecting the bank s risk of loss from commercial lending include each borrower s ability to manage its business affairs and cash flows  local and general economic conditions and real estate values in the company s service area 
the company manages its commercial loan portfolio by monitoring its borrowers payment performance and their respective financial condition and makes periodic adjustments  if necessary  to the risk grade assigned to each loan in the portfolio 
the company s evaluations of its borrowers are facilitated by management s knowledge of local market conditions and periodic reviews by a consultant of the credit administration policies of the company 
real estate portfolio credit risk management the principal source of repayment of the real estate construction loans of the company is the sale of the underlying collateral or the availability of permanent financing from the company or other lending source 
the principal risks associated with real estate construction lending include project cost overruns that absorb the borrower s equity in the project and deterioration of real estate values as a result of various factors  including competitive pressures and economic downturns 
the company manages its credit risk associated with real estate construction lending by establishing a loan to value ratio on projects on an as completed basis  inspecting project status in advance of disbursements  and matching maturities with expected completion dates 
generally  the company requires a loan to value ratio of not more than on single family residential construction loans 
the specific underwriting standards of the company and methods for each of its principal lines of lending include industry accepted analysis and modeling and certain proprietary techniques 
the underwriting criteria of the bank are designed to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines  including required loan to value ratios 
the credit administration policies of the company contain mandatory lien position and debt service coverage requirements  and the bank generally requires a guarantee from individuals owning or more of the borrowing entity 

table of contents concentrations of credit risk portfolio credit risk is evaluated with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in unacceptable levels of risk 
concentrations of credit exposure can be measured in various ways including industry  product  geography  and customer relationship 
we review non real estate commercial loans by industry and real estate loans by geographic location and property type 
nonperforming assets the company s practice is to place an asset on nonaccrual status when one of the following events occurs i any installment of principal or interest is days or more past due unless in management s opinion the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  ii management determines the ultimate collection of principal or interest to be unlikely or iii the terms of the loan have been renegotiated due to a serious weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
nonperforming loans may be on nonaccrual  are days past due and still accruing  or have been restructured 
allowance for loan and lease losses alll the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the loans and leases portfolio 
within the allowance  reserves are allocated to segments of the portfolio based on specific formula components 
changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the consolidated statement of income in the provision for loan losses 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of our lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectibility 
these evaluations include general conditions such as the portfolio composition  size and maturities of various segmented portions of the portfolio such as secured  unsecured  construction  and small business administration sba 
additional factors include concentrations of borrowers  industries  geographical sectors  loan product  loan classes and collateral types  volume and trends of loan delinquencies and non accrual  criticized and classified assets and trends in the aggregate in significant credits identified as watch list items 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based upon independent methodologies 
all components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation performed pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas statement no 
 accounting for contingencies or sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
management s estimate of each sfas no 
component is based on certain observable data that management believes is the most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated 
changes in the amount of each component of the allowance for loan losses are directionally consistent with changes in the observable data  taking into account the interaction of the sfas no 
components over time 
an essential element of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses is the company s credit risk evaluation process  which includes credit risk grading individual  commercial  construction  commercial real estate  and consumer loans 
loans are assigned credit risk grades based on the company s assessment of conditions that affect the borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement 
that process includes reviewing borrower s current financial information  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and other information specific to each individual borrower 
loans are reviewed on an annual or rotational basis or as management become aware of information affecting the borrower s ability to fulfill its obligations 
credit risk grades carry a dollar weighted risk percentage 
for individually impaired loans  sfas no 
provides guidance on the acceptable methods to measure impairment 
specifically  sfas no 
states that when a loan is impaired  we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan  we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions  including the effect of existing environmental factors 
in addition to the alll  an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined using estimates of the probability of funding 
this reserve is carried as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents we make provisions to the alll on a regular basis through charges to operations that are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as provision expense for loan losses 
when a loan is deemed uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
any recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited back to the allowance 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular categories of the loan portfolio 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s alll 
such agencies may require the company to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
there is uncertainty concerning future economic trends 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provisions for possible loan losses in future periods 
the alll should not be interpreted as an indication that charge offs in future periods will occur in the stated amounts or proportions 
the following table summarizes the activity in the alll reserves for the periods indicated

table of contents market risk management market risk is the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices and yields 
market risk is inherent in the company s operating positions and activities including customers loans  deposit accounts  securities and long term debt 
loans and deposits generate income and expense  respectively  and the value of cash flows change based on general economic levels  most importantly  the level of interest rates 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the company is to maximize stockholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the company to undue interest rate risk 
the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on the company s profitability 
market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the company does not operate a trading account  and does not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange 
the company faces market risk through interest rate volatility 
net interest income risk is measured based on rate shocks over different time horizons versus a current stable interest rate environment 
assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used in the planning and budgeting model 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis with alco 
securities portfolio the securities portfolio is central to our asset liability management strategies 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity and regulatory requirements 
the company classifies its securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase 
generally  all securities are purchased with the intent and ability to hold the security for long term investment  and the company has both the ability and intent to hold held to maturity investments to maturity 
the company does not engage in trading activities 
securities held to maturity are carried at cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 
securities available for sale may be sold to implement the company s asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors 
securities available for sale are recorded at market value and unrealized gains or losses  net of income taxes  are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  in a separate component of stockholders equity 
gain or loss on sale of securities is based on the specific identification method 
securities held to maturity at december   and consisted of municipal and mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of   and  respectively 
at december    had a contractual maturity of over ten years and a weighted average yield of 
operational risk management operational risk is the potential for loss resulting from events involving people  processes  technology  legal or regulatory issues  external events  and reputation 
in keeping with the corporate governance structure  the senior leadership committee is responsible for operational risk controls 
operational risks are managed through specific policies and procedures  controls and monitoring tools 
examples of these include reconciliation processes  transaction monitoring and analysis and system audits 
operational risks fall into two major categories  business specific and company wide 
the senior leadership committee works to ensure consistency in policies  processes and assessments 
with respect to company wide risks  the senior leadership committee works directly with directors to develop policies and procedures for information security  business resumption plans  compliance and legal issues 
critical accounting policies general the company s significant accounting principles are described in note of the consolidated financial statements and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
bank of commerce holdings consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
some of the company s accounting principles require significant judgement to estimate values of assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying the complex accounting principles to transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 

table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses alll the allowance for loan and lease losses is management s best estimate of the probable losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting 
sfas no 
which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and sfas no 
 which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between that value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of its lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectibility 
these evaluations include general conditions such as the portfolio composition  size and maturities of various segmented portions of the portfolio such as secured  unsecured  construction  and small business administration sba 
additional factors include concentrations of borrowers  industries  geographical sectors  loan product  loan classes and collateral types  volume and trends of loan delinquencies and non accrual  criticized and classified assets and trends in the aggregate in significant credits identified as watch list items 
there are several components to the determination of the adequacy of the alll 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the company estimates the sfas no 
portion of the alll based on the segmentation of its portfolio 
for those segments that require an alll  the company estimates loan losses on a monthly basis based upon its ongoing loan review process and analysis of loan performance 
the company follows a systematic and consistently applied approach to select the most appropriate loss measurement methods and support its conclusions and rationale with written documentation 
one method of estimating loan losses for groups of loans is through the application of loss rates to the groups aggregate loan balances 
such rates typically reflect historical loss experience for each group of loans  adjusted for relevant economic factors over a defined period of time 
the company evaluates and modifies its loss estimation model as needed to ensure that the resulting loss estimate is consistent with gaap 
for individually impaired loans  sfas no 
provides guidance on the acceptable methods to measure impairment 
specifically  sfas no 
states that when a loan is impaired  the company should measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan  the company considers all available information reflecting past events and current conditions  including the effect of existing environmental factors 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  accounting for stock based compensation was adopted by the company as of january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under statement no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
prior to adopting fsas no 
 the company used the intrinsic value based method for measuring compensation cost related to stock options 
under the intrinsic value based method  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the company applied accounting principles board opinion apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock options 
during  the fair value of options granted was determined on the date of the grant using a binomial option pricing model with the following assumptions a current volatility rate of  a risk fee interest rate of based upon the five year treasury coupon rate at the time the options were issued  expected dividends of per share per year  an annual dividend rate of  an assumed forfeiture rate of zero and an expected life of seven years 
revenue recognition the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income it receives on interest earning assets and the interest expense it pays on interest bearing liabilities  and ii fee income  which includes fees earned on deposit services  income from sba lending  electronic based cash management services  mortgage brokerage fee income and merchant credit card processing services 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 
note to the consolidated financial statements offers an explanation of the process for determining when the accrual of interest income is discontinued on an impaired loan 

table of contents fixed assets other estimates that the company uses in its accounting include the expected useful lives of depreciable assets  such as buildings  building improvements  equipment  and furniture 
the useful lives of various technological related hardware and software could be subject to change due to advances in technology and the general adoption of new standards for technology or interfaces among computer or telecommunication systems 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced

uniform bank performance reports are available on all federal deposit insurance corporation insured financial institutions and are used to measure quality performance to peer groupings and may be obtained online at www 
fdic 
gov 
executive management monitors the high performing sector of the peer group and uses this data to examine strategies of other high performing financial institutions and to establish the financial performance goals of the company on an annual basis 
these goals are then communicated through budgets  strategies  planning and projections to the senior leadership team for implementation 
results are monitored both to plan and to peer at the board of directors level on a monthly basis 

table of contents sources of income the company derives its income from two principal sources i net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income it receives on interest earning assets and the interest expense it pays on interest bearing liabilities  and ii fee income  which includes fees earned on deposit services  income from sba lending  electronic based cash management services  mortgage brokerage fee income and merchant credit card processing services 
the income of the company depends to a great extent on net interest income 
these interest rate factors are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  inflation  recession  and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  in particular  the federal reserve board 
because of the company s predisposition to variable rate pricing and non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  the company is considered asset sensitive 
consequently  the company is adversely affected by declining interest rates 
net interest income reflects both our net interest margin the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding and the amount of earning assets we hold 
as a result  changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold could affect the company s net interest income and the company s earnings 
changes in interest rates up or down could adversely affect the company s net interest margin 
although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  causing our net interest margin to expand or contract 
many of our assets are tied to prime rate  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates fall  our yield we earn on our assets may fall faster than the repricing opportunities of our liabilities  causing our net interest margin to contract until the repricing of liabilities catches up 
changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction  magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve 
we currently hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives 
we do not hedge all of our interest rate risk 
there is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what we assumed 
for example  if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes  we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments 
to reduce our interest rate risk  we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios  refinance our debt and take other strategic actions 
we may incur losses or expenses when we take such actions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately  or  over net income of million for the year ended december  top line revenues are up million over the prior year

table of contents income taxes the company s provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes and reflects the application of federal and state statutory rates to the company s income before taxes 
the principal difference between statutory tax rates and the company s effective tax rate is the benefit derived from key life proceeds  investing in tax exempt securities and preferential state tax treatment for qualified enterprise zone loans

the objective of effective capital management is to produce above market long term returns by using capital when returns are perceived to be high and issuing capital when costs are perceived to be low 
the company s potential sources of capital include retained earnings  common and preferred stock issuance  and issuance of subordinated debt and trust preferred securities 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on a day to day basis by the company s management and reported to the company s board of directors on a monthly basis 
the regulators of the bank measure capital adequacy by using a risk based capital framework and by monitoring compliance with minimum leverage ratio guidelines 
under the risk based capital standard  assets reported on the company s balance sheet and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each of which is assigned a risk weight 
this standard characterizes an institution s capital as being tier capital defined as principally comprising stockholders equity and tier capital defined as principally comprising the qualifying portion of the alll 
the minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets  including certain off balance sheet items  is 
at least one half of the total risk based capital is to be comprised of common equity  the balance may consist of debt securities and a limited portion of the alll 

table of contents quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets 
management believes as of december  and  that the company and the bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal deposit insurance corporation categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

lending transactions with related parties the company s conduct of business with director s  officers  significant stockholders and other related parties collectively  related parties is restricted and governed by various laws and regulations  including regulation o as promulgated and enforced by the federal reserve 
furthermore  it is the company s policy to conduct business with related parties on an arm s length basis at current market prices with terms and conditions no more favorable than the company provides in its normal course of business 
some of the directors  officers and principal stockholders of the company and their associates were customers of and had banking transactions with the bank in the ordinary course of the bank s business during and the bank expects to have such transactions in the future 
all loans and commitments to loans included in such transactions were made in compliance with the applicable laws on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons of similar creditworthiness  and in the opinion of the company  did not involve more than a normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features

commitments off balance sheet financial instruments in the ordinary course of business  the company enters various types of transactions  which involve financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit  which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
these transactions may involve  to varying degrees  credit and interest rate risk more than the amount  if any recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the off balance sheet credit risk exposure of the company is the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company applies the same credit standards to these contracts as it uses for loans recorded on the balance sheet 
december  off balance sheet commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit guaranteed commitments outstanding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers 
these commitments have specified interest rates and generally have fixed expiration dates but may be terminated by the company if certain conditions of the contract are violated 
although currently subject to draw down  many of the commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
collateral held relating to these commitments varies  but generally includes real estate  securities and cash 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
credit risk arises in these transactions from the possibility that a customer may not be able to repay the company upon default of performance 
collateral held for standby letters of credit is based on an individual evaluation of each customer s creditworthiness  but may include cash and securities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as market movements 
the risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our banking business  our asset liability management alm process  and credit risk mitigation activities 
traditional loan and deposit products are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities 
these positions are subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk is the effect of changes in economic value of our loans and deposits  as well as our other interest rate sensitive instruments and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk as part of the alm process 
interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our financial instruments 
our overall goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect net interest income 
interest rates risk is measured as the potential volatility in our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
lending and deposit taking create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet 
interest rate risk from these activities as well as the impact of ever changing market conditions is mitigated using the alm process 
the company does not operate a trading account and does not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodities 
the company faces market risk through interest rate volatility 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the internal alco roundtable group maintains a net interest income forecast using different rate scenarios utilizing a simulation model 
this group updates the net interest income forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic and market conditions 
the simulation model used includes measures of the expected repricing characteristics of administered rate now  savings and money market accounts and non related products demand deposit accounts  other assets and other liabilities 
these measures recognize the relative sensitivity of these accounts to changes in market interest rates  as demonstrated through current and historical experience  recognizing the timing differences of rate changes 
in the simulation of net interest margin and net income the forecast balance sheet is processed against five rate scenarios 
these five rate scenarios include a flat rate environment  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future and four additional rate ramp scenarios ranging for to basis points in basis point increments  unless the rate environment cannot move in these basis point increments before reaching zero 
the formal policies and practices adopted by the company to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure measure risk in two ways i repricing opportunities for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and ii changes in net interest income for declining interest rate shocks of to basis points 
because of the company s predisposition to variable rate pricing and noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  the company is asset sensitive 
as a result  management anticipates that  in a declining interest rate environment  the company s net interest income and margin would be expected to decline  and  in an increasing interest rate environment  the company s net interest income and margin would be expected to increase 
however  no assurance can be given that under such circumstances the company would experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
because the company is asset sensitive  the company is adversely affected by declining rates rather than rising rates 

table of contents to estimate the effect of interest rate shocks on the company s net interest income  management uses a model to prepare an analysis of interest rate risk exposure 
such analysis calculates the change in net interest income given a change in the federal funds rate of or basis points up or down 
all changes are measured in dollars and are compared to projected net interest income 
at december   the estimated annualized reduction in net interest income attributable to a and basis point decline in the federal funds rate was  and  respectively 
at december   the estimated annualized reduction in net interest income attributable to a and basis point decline in the federal funds rate was  and  respectively  with a similar and opposite result attributable to a and basis point increase in the federal funds rate 
the alco has established a policy limitation to interest rate risk of of the net interest margin and of the present value of equity 
the securities portfolio is integral to our asset liability management process 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity  regulatory requirements and the relative mix of our cash positions 
the company s approach to managing interest rate risk may include the use of derivatives 
this helps to minimize significant  unplanned fluctuations in earnings  fair values of assets and liabilities and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
this approach involves an off balance sheet instrument with the same characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin and cash flows 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  hedged assets and liabilities will gain or lose market value 
in a fair value hedging strategy  the effect of this unrealized gain or loss will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities 
for a cash flow hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative to the extent that it is effective is recorded through other comprehensive income 
we may use derivatives as part of our interest rate risk management  including interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
at inception  the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items is formally documented with our risk management objective  strategy and our evaluation of effectiveness of the hedge transactions 
this includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific transactions 
periodically  as required  we formally assess whether the derivative we designated in the hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the distribution of repricing opportunities for the bank s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it also reports the gap different volumes of rate sensitive assets and liabilities repricing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at different time intervals  the cumulative gap  the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for each repricing interval  and the cumulative gap to total assets

table of contents dollars in thousands at december  within months to one year to over months one year five years five years total cumulative gap ratio gap as of earning assets cumulative gap as of earning assets the model utilized by management to create the analysis described in the preceding paragraph uses balance sheet simulation to estimate the impact of changing rates on the projected annual net interest income of the company 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
management believes that the short duration of its rate sensitive assets and liabilities contributes to its ability to reprice a significant amount of its rate sensitive assets and liabilities and mitigate the impact of rate changes in excess of or basis points 
the model s primary benefit to management is its assistance in evaluating the impact that future strategies with respect to the company s mix and level of rate sensitive assets and liabilities will have on the company s net interest income
