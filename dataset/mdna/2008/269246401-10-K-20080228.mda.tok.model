item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
glossary of terms in analyzing and discussing our business  we utilize certain metrics  ratios and other terms that are defined in the glossary of terms  which is located at the end of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview strategy our strategy centers on growing our global customer base and mitigating the risks associated with our balance sheet 
we plan to grow our global customer base by appealing to retail investors  specifically those who are customers of large established financial institutions  by providing them with innovative  easy  low cost financial solutions and service 
our financial solutions include a suite of trading  investing  banking and lending products 
our plan to mitigate the risks associated with our balance sheet contains three core goals reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio  reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses 
we believe that the successful completion of this plan will significantly improve our financial strength and will help restore customer and investor confidence in our franchise 
we are also focused on simplifying and streamlining the business by exiting and or restructuring certain non core operations  primarily in our lending and institutional businesses 
we believe these changes will better align our business with the global retail investor 
key factors affecting financial performance our financial performance is affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including customer demand for financial products and services  the weakness or strength of the residential real estate and credit markets  customer perception of the financial strength of our franchise  market demand and liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans and securities  interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve  and the performance  volume and volatility of the equity and capital markets 
in addition to the items noted above  our success in the future will depend upon  among other things continuing our success in the acquisition  growth and retention of customers  deepening customer acceptance of our products and services  our ability to assess and manage credit risk  and disciplined expense control and improved operational efficiency 

table of contents management monitors a number of metrics in evaluating the company s performance 
the most significant of these are shown in the table and discussed in the text below as of or for the year ended december  variance vs 
customer activity metrics retail client assets dollars in billions customer cash and deposits dollars in billions us daily average revenue trades international daily average revenue trades total daily average revenue trades average commission per trade company financial metrics net revenue growth enterprise net interest spread basis points enterprise interest earning assets average in billions nonperforming loans as a of gross loans receivable allowance for loan losses dollars in millions allowance for loan losses as a of nonperforming loans percentage not meaningful 
customer cash and deposits  as well as retail client assets  have been re presented to account for a methodology change in the metric to settlement date from trade date reporting as of december  which reduced both metrics by million 
this is not a methodology change in accounting policy and does not impact the reporting of these items on our balance sheet 
revenue growth is the difference between the current and prior comparable period total net revenue divided by the prior comparable period total net revenue 
customer activity metrics retail client assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer 
an increase in retail client assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding 
changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities 
customer cash and deposits are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income 
daily average revenue trades darts are the predominant driver of commission revenue from our retail customers 
average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix  product mix and or product pricing 
as a result  this metric is impacted by both the mix between our retail domestic and international businesses and the mix between active traders  mass affluent and main street customers 
company financial metrics net revenue growth is an indicator of our overall financial well being and our ability to execute on our strategy 
the negative revenue growth during the period was due to lower revenue in our institutional segment  due to the loss on sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and increased provision for loan losses 
enterprise net interest spread is a broad indicator of our ability to generate net operating interest income 
enterprise interest earning assets  in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread  are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income 

table of contents total nonperforming loans receivable as a percentage of gross loans receivable is an indicator of the performance of our total loan portfolio 
allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is a general indicator of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
changes in this ratio are also driven by changes in the mix of our loan portfolio 
significant events in citadel investment of billion including sale of asset backed securities portfolio the operating environment during  particularly during the second half of the year  was extremely challenging as our exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets adversely impacted our financial performance and led to a disruption in our customer base

on november   we entered into an agreement to receive a billion cash infusion from citadel 
in consideration for the cash infusion  citadel received three primary items substantially all of our asset backed securities portfolio  million shares of common stock in the company and approximately billion in springing lien notes

our plan contains three core goals reduce credit risk in our loan portfolio  reduce our level of corporate debt and reduce operating expenses to allow us to reinvest in growth initiatives within the core retail franchise

the losses in our institutional segment caused by this crisis more than offset the considerable growth in our retail segment 
total net revenue for the year ended december  decreased compared to the prior year due primarily to the billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of million to million 
as a result of the decrease in net revenue  net income declined by from the prior year to a loss of billion for the year ended december  the retail segment delivered strong organic growth and overall results during the year ended december  total retail segment income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this growth in the retail segment was primarily driven by a increase in net operating interest income and a increase in commission revenue compared to the same period in the prior year

the increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of billion in loans receivable  net 
the increase in loans receivable  net was due principally to growth in our one to four family loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of beginning in the second half of  we altered our strategy and halted our previous focus on growing our balance sheet 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to allow our interest earning assets  particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans  to pay down  resulting in an overall decline in balance 
during this period  we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at e trade bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio 
in connection with this strategy and the citadel investment  we have updated our secondary market purchase policies to prohibit the acquisition of asset backed securities  cdos and certain other instruments with a high level of credit risk through january  earnings overview compared to net income loss decreased to a loss of billion for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in net income for the year ended december  was due principally to the billion loss on the sale of our asset backed securities portfolio and an increase in our provision for loan losses of million to million

we believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items 
our operating interest income and operating interest expense is generated from the operations of the company and is a broad indicator of our success in our banking  lending and balance sheet management businesses 
our corporate debt  which is the primary source of our corporate interest expense  has been issued primarily in connection with the citadel investment and acquisitions  such as harrisdirect and brownco 
similarly  we report gain loss on sales of investments  net separately from gain loss on loans and securities  net 
we believe reporting these two items separately provides a clearer picture of the financial performance of our operations than would a presentation that combined these two items 
gain loss on loans and securities  net are the result of activities in our operations  namely our lending and balance sheet management businesses  including impairment on our available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities portfolio 
gain loss on sales of investments  net relates to historical equity investments of the company at the corporate level and are not related to the ongoing business of our operating subsidiaries

for the foreseeable future  we plan to allow our interest earning assets  particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans  to pay down  resulting in an overall decline in balances of these assets 
average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily in retail deposits 
average retail deposits increased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the same period in increases in average retail deposits were driven by growth in the complete savings account 
we expect average retail deposits to continue to grow and replace repurchase agreements and fhlb advances as they mature 
enterprise net interest spread decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily the result of a challenging interest rate environment throughout the past months as well as growth in our complete savings account  which pays a higher interest rate than the majority of our other deposit products 
we expect this decline to subside  as we focus on reducing our wholesale borrowings  which have a higher cost of borrowing when compared to deposits

table of contents provision for loan losses provision for loan losses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in the provision for loan losses was related primarily to deterioration in the performance of our home equity loan portfolio in the second half of we believe this deterioration was caused by several factors  which are described below 
first  the combined impact of rising mortgage rates and home price depreciation in key markets contributed to the declining performance of our home equity loan portfolio 
second  concerns that began in the sub prime mortgage loan market spread to the broader credit markets beginning in the second half of  resulting in a significant deterioration in the overall credit markets 
this deterioration led to a dramatic tightening of lending standards across the industry  and general liquidity pressure for many mortgage lenders  some of whom ultimately ceased operations as a result 
the factors described above dramatically reduced the ability of borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans  specifically their home equity loans  therefore drastically increasing the risk of loss once a loan becomes delinquent 
during the second half of  we also observed a decline in the percentage of delinquent loans that cure prior to charge off or foreclosure once they have become delinquent 
we attribute this change in behavior to the factors described above  which have significantly limited borrowers alternatives to avoid defaulting on their loans 
in addition  because of the decline in value of the homes collateralizing our home equity loans  our ability to recover our investment by foreclosing on the underlying properties has diminished as well 
we believe the provision for loan losses will continue at historically high levels in future periods as the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets continues to impact the performance of our loan portfolio 
commission commission revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  which was driven by an increase of million  or  in our retail commission revenue 
the primary factors that affect our retail commission revenue are darts and average commission per trade  which is impacted by both trade types and the mix between our domestic and international businesses 
each business has a different pricing structure  unique to its customer base and local market practices  and as a result  a change in the relative number of executed trades in these businesses impacts average commission per trade 
each business also has different trade types eg equities  options  fixed income  exchange traded funds  contract for difference and mutual funds that can have different commission rates 
as a result  changes in the mix of trade types within either of these businesses may impact average commission per trade 
institutional commission revenue is also impacted by negotiated rates  which differ by customer 
our institutional customers are provided with global execution and settlement services as well as worldwide access to research provided by third parties in exchange for commissions based on negotiated rates 
we expect our institutional commission revenue to decline substantially in as we plan to exit a significant portion of our institutional brokerage operations 
darts increased to  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in our us dart volume increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in our international darts grew by for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  driven entirely by organic growth 
our international operations continue to be a strong growth contributor within our retail trading business  and we believe that over time they will become a significant component of our entire business 
in addition  option related darts further increased as a percentage of our total us darts and now represent of us trading volume versus a year ago 

table of contents average commission per trade decreased to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily a function of the mix of customers 
main street investors  who generally have a higher commission per trade  traded less during the period compared to active traders and mass affluent  who generally have a lower commission per trade 
customer appreciation and win back campaigns  particularly in the fourth quarter of  also contributed to the decrease in average commission per trade 
fees and service charges during the first quarter of  the company re defined the line item service charges and fees by reclassifying certain fee like revenue items formerly reported in other revenue into the service charges and fees line item  now called fees and service charges 
the fee like revenue streams moved include payment for order flow  foreign currency margin revenue  b fees after rebates  fixed income product revenue and management fee revenue 
fees and service charges increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due to an increase in order flow payment  advisor management fees  foreign currency margin revenue  fixed income product revenue and mutual fund fees  partially offset by a decrease in account maintenance fees and mortgage servicing fees 
we expect our account maintenance fee income to continue to decline over time as we have fewer customers who are subject to the fee 
principal transactions principal transactions decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease in principal transactions resulted from lower institutional trading volumes 
our principal transactions revenue is influenced by overall trading volumes  the number of stocks for which we act as a market maker  the trading volumes of those specific stocks and the performance of our proprietary trading activities

the company expects the effective tax rate to increase compared to the tax rates for and the two principal reasons for the increased effective tax rate in are the non deductibility of a portion of the interest expense on the springing lien notes as well as a reduction in the amount of tax exempt interest earned on state and local fixed income securities

retail trading order flow is leveraged by the institutional segment to generate additional revenue for the company 
compared to as a result of our exposure to the credit crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets  our institutional segment incurred a loss of billion for the year ended december  the loss was driven primarily by losses in our asset backed securities portfolio of approximately billion as well as provision for loan losses for our loan portfolio of million for the year ended december  following the citadel transaction  we no longer have exposure to asset backed securities  as such  we do not anticipate losses of this level to occur in future periods 
however  we do continue to have exposure to mortgage loans and therefore expect the provision for loan losses to continue at historically high levels

during the first quarter of  we re presented our balance sheet to report margin receivables and customer payables directly on the face of the balance sheet 
the remaining components of brokerage receivables and brokerage payables are now reported in the other assets and accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities line items  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we re presented our balance sheet to report investment in fhlb stock directly on the face of the balance sheet 
this item was previously reported in the available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities line item 
the increase in total assets was attributable primarily to an increase of billion in loans receivable  net 
the increase in loans receivable  net was due principally to growth in our one to four family real estate loan portfolio during the first and second quarters of beginning in the second half of  we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to allow our interest earning assets  particularly our mortgage backed securities and home equity loans  to pay down  resulting in an overall decline in balance 
during this period  we plan to increase our excess regulatory capital levels at e trade bank as we focus on mitigating the credit risk inherent in our home equity loan portfolio 
the increase in total liabilities primarily was attributable to the increase in deposits  wholesale borrowings and corporate debt 
the billion increase in deposits was due primarily to the significant growth in money 
table of contents market and savings accounts during the first three quarters of  which was largely offset by the decline in deposits during the fourth quarter 
the increase in wholesale borrowings contributed to the growth of the loans receivable  net during the first and second quarters of the billion increase in corporate debt is due to the billion of springing lien notes issued to citadel in the fourth quarter of loans receivable  net loans receivable  net are summarized as follows dollars in thousands december  variance vs

beginning in the second half of  we altered our strategy and halted the focus on growing the balance sheet 
therefore  we do not expect to grow our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we intend to allow our home equity and consumer loan portfolios to decline over time 
as a general matter  we do not originate or purchase sub prime loans to hold on our balance sheet  however  in the normal course of purchasing large pools of real estate loans  we invariably end up acquiring a de minimis amount of these loans 
as of december   sub prime real estate loans represented less than one fifth of one percent of our total real estate loan portfolio 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a credit default swap cds on billion of our first lien residential real estate loan portfolio through a synthetic securitization structure 
a cds provides  for a fee  an assumption by a third party of a portion of the credit risk related to the underlying loans 
the cds we entered into provides protection for losses in excess of basis points  but not to exceed approximately basis points 
in addition  our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of this transaction because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to an unaffiliated third party 
defined as borrowers with fico scores less than at time of origination

deposits increased billion to billion at december  compared to december   driven by a billion increase in money market and savings accounts 
deposits generally provide us the benefit of lower interest costs  compared with wholesale funding alternatives 
during the first three quarters of  the deposits balance increased billion  primarily the result of the growth in our complete savings account 
this product created measurable growth in cash from new and existing customers  however  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a disruption in our customer base and the customer deposit balances began to decline 
we believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment 
while we continue to anticipate credit related losses  primarily in our home equity loan portfolio  we believe our retail customer base has stabilized  and will return to growth in the deposits balance is a component of the total customer cash and deposits balance reported as a customer activity metric of billion for the year ended december  the total customer cash and deposits balance is summarized as follows dollars in thousands december  variance vs

the increase in other borrowings of billion during the year ended december  was due primarily to an increase in fhlb advances 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase coupled with fhlb advances are the primary wholesale funding sources of the bank 
during the first and second quarters of  the bank used these wholesale sources along with deposit growth to fund the increase in loans receivable 
we expect total other borrowings to decline in future periods as we focus on replacing this funding with growth in retail deposits 
corporate debt corporate debt is summarized as follows dollars in thousands december  variance vs

corporate debt increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase is related to the billion of springing lien notes issued to citadel at a discount of million in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources we have established liquidity and capital policies 
the objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a disruption in our customer base  which caused a significant decline in customer deposits 
we believe this disruption was due to the uncertainty surrounding the company in connection with the credit related losses in our institutional segment 
deposits are the primary source of liquidity for e trade bank  so this sudden and rapid decline created a substantial amount of liquidity risk 
we followed our existing liquidity policies and contingency 
table of contents plans and successfully met our liquidity needs during this extraordinary period 
we believe that our ability to meet liquidity needs during this time validates the effectiveness of the liquidity policies and contingency plans 
capital is generated primarily through our business operations and our capital market activities 
during the second half of  our institutional segment incurred a significant amount of losses as a result of its exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets 
consequently  this segment required a significant capital infusion during the fourth quarter 
the company raised billion in cash from the citadel investment  the majority of which was used to provide capital to the intuitional segment 
while this segment continues to have exposure to the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets  we believe that the proceeds from the citadel investment as well as capital generated in our retail segment will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
changes in cash and equivalents in  the consolidated cash and equivalents balance increased to billion for the period ended december  cash and equivalents at e trade financial corporation  on a standalone holding company basis  increased million to million due primarily to an increase in cash provided by operating activities of million and by financing activities of billion offset by a decrease in net cash used in investing activities of billion

in addition to converging arrows  brokerage and banking subsidiaries may provide liquidity to the parent  however  they are restricted by regulatory guidelines 
e trade bank is prohibited by regulations from lending to the parent company 
at december   e trade bank had approximately million of capital above the well capitalized level 
in the current credit environment  we plan to increase the excess capital at e trade bank in order to increase our ability to absorb credit losses while still maintaining well capitalized status 
therefore  we do not expect to dividend this excess capital to the parent during the foreseeable future 
e trade bank is also required by office of thrift supervision ots regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least of tangible assets 
e trade bank satisfied this requirement at december  and however  events beyond management s control  such as a continued deterioration in residential real estate and credit markets  could adversely affect future earnings and e trade bank s ability to meet its future capital requirements 
brokerage subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of  or of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions 
at december  and  all of our significant brokerage subsidiaries met their minimum net capital requirements
