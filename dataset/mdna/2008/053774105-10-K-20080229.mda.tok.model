item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we operate two of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental industry through avis rent a car system  llc and budget rent a car system  inc we provide car and truck rentals and ancillary services to businesses and consumers in the united states and internationally 
we operate in the following business segments domestic car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services in the united states 
international car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services primarily in argentina  australia  canada  new zealand  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
truck rental provides truck rentals and related services to consumers and light commercial users in the united states 
our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  and iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of gps navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals 
we also earn royalty revenue from our franchisees in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
car rental volumes are closely associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements 
because we operate primarily in the united states and generate a significant portion of our revenue from our on airport operations  we expect that our ability to generate revenue growth will be somewhat dependent on increases in domestic enplanements 
we have also experienced significant per unit fleet cost increases on model year and vehicles  which have negatively impacted our margins 
accordingly  our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods remains dependent on our ability to successfully reflect corresponding changes in our pricing programs 
our vehicle rental operations are seasonal 
historically  the third quarter of the year has been our strongest quarter due to the increased level of leisure travel and household moving activity 
any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the third quarter could have a disproportionately adverse impact on our results of operations 
we have a predominantly variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size and  therefore  the cost of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 
however  certain expenses  such as rent  are fixed and cannot be reduced in response to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
we believe that the following trends  among others  may affect and or have impacted our financial condition and results of operations domestic enplanements  which increased compared to and are expected to increase modestly in  assuming there are no major disruptions in travel  rising per unit car fleet costs  which we began to experience in and anticipate will continue with model year vehicles  
table of contents pricing increases  which we instituted throughout in response to rising fleet costs and intend to continue to pursue  where appropriate  our continued expansion in off airport  or local markets  including insurance replacement rentals  legislative changes in certain states that enable us to recover a greater percentage of airport concession and vehicle licensing fees  which favorably impacted our year over year results throughout  and decreased demand for truck rentals  which has been impacted by household moving activity 
in  we undertook a strategic realignment to simplify our business model through exiting non core businesses or businesses that produced volatility to our earnings inconsistent with our business model and the remainder of our core businesses 
in october  the strategic realignment was completed and our management team and board of directors  with the aid of financial and legal advisors  performed a comprehensive review of the growth opportunities and estimated market valuations for each of our core businesses 
as a result of this review  from october to july  our board of directors approved a plan to separate cendant into four independent companies realogy corporation encompasses our former realogy segment  which is now presented as a discontinued operation 
wyndham worldwide corporation encompasses our former hospitality services and timeshare resorts segments  which are now presented as discontinued operations 
travelport  inc encompasses our former travel distribution services segment  which is now presented as a discontinued operation 
avis budget group  inc encompasses our vehicle rental operations 
on july   we completed the spin offs of realogy corporation realogy and wyndham worldwide corporation wyndham in tax free distributions of one share each of realogy and wyndham common stock for every four and five shares  respectively  of then outstanding cendant common stock held on july  on august   realogy and wyndham stock began regular way trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbols h and wyn  respectively 
prior to the completion of the spin offs  we received special cash dividends of  million and  million from realogy and wyndham  respectively  and utilized such proceeds to fund a portion of the repayment of our outstanding debt  as discussed below 
on august   we completed the sale of travelport for proceeds of approximately billion  net of closing adjustments  of which approximately billion was used to repay indebtedness of travelport 
the spin offs of realogy and wyndham and the sale of travelport are referred to as the cendant separation 
pursuant to the separation agreement  during third quarter  we distributed  million and million of the proceeds of the travelport sale to realogy and wyndham  respectively 
in connection with executing our plan  we incurred costs of million and million during and  respectively 
these costs consist primarily of legal  accounting  other professional and consulting fees and various employee costs  and for include costs associated with the retirement of corporate debt 
in connection with the cendant separation  we entered into the separation agreement  a tax sharing agreement and a transition services agreement with realogy  wyndham and travelport 
on august   our stockholders approved certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation  including a change in our name from cendant corporation to avis budget group  inc and a for reverse stock split of our common stock  each of which became effective on the new york stock exchange at the opening of the market on september  and  at that time  our ticker symbol changed to car 

table of contents results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to segregate and report as discontinued operations  for all periods presented  the account balances and activities of phh  wright express  our former marketing services division  realogy  wyndham and travelport 
prior to completion of the realogy spin off  we could not classify our former mortgage business as a discontinued operation due to realogy s participation in a mortgage origination venture that was established with phh in connection with our january spin off of phh 
however  due to the spin off of realogy on july   this business is classified as a discontinued operation 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual usage of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  any goodwill impairment charge  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

the growth in our car rental operations was partially offset by a reduction in truck rental days and an reduction in truck t m revenue per day 
ancillary revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  rentals of gps navigation units  and sales of loss damage waivers and insurance products 
in addition  the total revenue increase includes million related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our international operations results into us dollars 

table of contents total expenses increased million due to i a  million charge recorded for the impairment of goodwill at each of our reporting units to reflect the decline in their fair value as evidenced by a decline in the market value of our common stock  ii a million increase in operating expense largely due to the increase in car rental days  iii an increase in vehicle depreciation and lease charges of million resulting from higher per unit vehicle costs and growth in our average car rental fleet and iv the adverse impact from foreign exchange currency rates of million 
the increase in expenses was offset by decreases principally due to the million charge for early extinguishment of debt incurred during and a million decrease in separation related costs 
the separation costs related primarily to severance  retention and legal  accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the cendant separation 
we also experienced i a million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses resulting mainly from unallocated corporate expense in related to the discontinued operations treatment of our former subsidiaries and ii million lower interest expense related to corporate debt  resulting from the repayment of approximately billion of such debt in third quarter as a result of these items and a million reduction in our benefit from income taxes  our loss from continuing operations increased million 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations were benefits of and for and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for was primarily due to the non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge

domestic car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with we experienced increased demand for car rentals and significantly increased our ancillary revenues 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in rental days 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  million of which was offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities  ii a million increase in rentals of gps navigation units  sales of loss damage waivers and insurance products and other items  and iii an million increase in gasoline sales 
the favorable effect of incremental revenues was offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges primarily resulting from increased per unit fleet costs in and a increase in average fleet size 
ebitda also reflected a million increase in operating expenses including i million of additional expenses associated with increased car rental volume and fleet size  primarily related to credit card fees and agency operator commissions and ii million of incremental expenses  primarily representing inflationary increases in salaries and wages and off airport rental expense 
we incurred million more vehicle related interest expense during compared to  primarily due to the loss of intercompany interest income recorded in prior to the cendant separation 
ebitda also benefited from a million decrease in separation related costs  primarily related to accelerated vesting of stock based compensation awards incurred in international car rental revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared with  primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  increased car rental pricing and higher demand for car rentals 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in t m revenue per day and a increase in the number of days a car was rented 
the total growth in revenue includes a million increase related to the translation of foreign currency exchange rates  which increased t m revenue per day by and was largely offset in ebitda by the opposite impact on expenses and provided a net benefit of million year over year 
the million increase in ancillary revenues was due primarily to i a million increase in counter sales of insurance and other items  and ii a million increase in airport concession and vehicle licensing revenues  which was more than offset in ebitda by higher airport concession and vehicle licensing expenses remitted to airport and other regulatory authorities 
the favorable effect of incremental t m revenues was partially offset in ebitda by million of increased fleet depreciation and lease charges principally resulting from an increase of in the average size of our international rental fleet and increased per unit fleet costs including the effects of foreign exchange

ebitda also reflects million of incremental operating expenses including i million in inflationary increases in salaries and wages  rents and other costs  ii million in additional expenses associated with increased car rental volume  primarily related to license and registration fees and other vehicle costs  and iii million in increased gasoline expenses 
we incurred million more interest expense during than in due to increased borrowings for international operations and higher interest rates 
truck rental revenues and ebitda declined million and million  respectively  in compared with  primarily reflecting decreases in rental day volume and t m revenue per day 
ebitda was also impacted by increased fleet costs 
substantially all of the revenue decrease was due to a decline in t m revenue  which reflected a reduction in rental days and an decrease in t m revenue per day 
the reduction in rental days resulted primarily from declines in one way consumer and commercial volumes  and a reduction in the average size or our rental fleet 
we believe these decreases reflect a soft housing market and heightened competition for commercial rentals 
despite the reduction in the average size of our truck rental fleet  we incurred million of incremental fleet depreciation  interest and lease charges primarily due to higher per unit fleet costs  including a reduction in expense of million due to a change in projected vehicle hold periods 
these items were offset by million in reduced operating expenses  including i a decrease of million in operating commission expense primarily reflecting the decrease in t m revenue  ii a million decrease in maintenance and damage costs  and iii an million reduction in insurance expense as a result of favorable claims experience and the reduction in rental days 
ebitda also reflected a million reduction in restructuring charges compared to and a year over year reduction of million in costs related to the cendant separation 
corporate and other revenues decreased million and ebitda increased from a loss of million in to an income of million in revenues were lower in due to i the absence of million in revenue associated with a credit card marketing program under which we earned fees based on a percentage of credit card spending through the date of the cendant separation  ii a million decrease in revenues earned for information technology service contracts with realogy  wyndham and travelport as the contracts expire and services are no longer being provided and iii a million reduction primarily related to dividend income and gains on the sale of marketable securities in ebitda increased primarily due to i a million reduction in selling and general expenses resulting from the spin offs of realogy and wyndham and the sale of travelport in third quarter  ii a million reduction in separation related expenses  including unallocated corporate costs  iii a million reduction in legal fees for litigation related to the former cuc business units and iv a million decrease in intercompany interest expense prior to the cendant separation

our ebitda margins were negatively impacted by higher fleet and interest costs 
the revenue increase of million was comprised of a million increase in car rental t m revenue and a million increase in ancillary revenues 
the increase in t m revenue was principally driven by a increase in the number of days a car was rented which includes organic growth and a increase in t m revenue per day

these programs are distinct from our other activities as the assets are generally funded through the issuance of debt that is collateralized by such assets 
assets under vehicle programs are funded through borrowings under asset backed funding or other similar arrangements 
the income generated by these assets is used  in part  to repay the principal and interest associated with the debt 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of such assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our vehicle programs

table of contents liquidity risk we believe that access to our existing financing arrangements is sufficient to meet liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
our primary liquidity needs include the payment of operating expenses  corporate and vehicle related debt and procurement of rental vehicles to be used in our operations 
our primary sources of funding are operating revenue  cash received upon sale of vehicles  borrowings under our vehicle backed borrowing arrangements and our revolving credit facility 
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry or the asset backed financing market 
additionally  our liquidity as it relates to vehicle programs could be adversely affected by i the deterioration in the performance of the underlying assets of such programs  ii increased costs associated with the principal financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries if general motors corporation or ford motor company is not able to honor its obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related vehicles  iii any disruption in our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market and iv default by any of the financial guarantee firms that have insured a portion of our outstanding vehicle backed debt 
our liquidity may also be negatively impacted if either realogy or wyndham is unable to meet its indemnification and other obligations under the agreements among us  realogy  wyndham and travelport entered into in connection with the cendant separation 
access to our credit facilities may be limited if we were to fail to meet certain financial ratios or other requirements 
additionally  we monitor the maintenance of required financial ratios and  as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facilities

accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and or events that are outside of our control 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management s projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among three reporting units 
a  million charge was recorded for the impairment of goodwill at each of our reporting units to reflect the decline in the fair value as evidenced by a decline in the market value of our common stock 
domestic car rental operations recorded million of the goodwill impairment  international car rental recorded million and truck rental recorded million 
following the goodwill impairment charge  the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was approximately billion and million  respectively  at december  vehicles 
we present vehicles at cost  net of accumulated depreciation on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record the initial cost of the vehicle net of incentives and allowances from manufactures 
we acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs 
for rental vehicles purchased under such programs  we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values 
for vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
public liability  property damage and other insurance liabilities  net 
insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include additional liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents and changes in the ultimate cost per incident

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our debt 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we also use derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure at december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio and interest rate derivative portfolios 
the primary assumption used in this model is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
