table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading national radio broadcast company whose business is acquiring  developing and operating radio stations located throughout the united states 
cox enterprises indirectly owns approximately of our common stock and has approximately of the voting power of cox radio 
the primary source of our revenues is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
for the year ended december   and of our net revenues were generated from local and national advertising  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  and of net revenues  respectively  were generated from local advertising and of net revenues were generated from national advertising 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  our stations also exchange advertising time for goods  services or programming  which can be used by the stations in their business operations 
the use of such barter transactions is generally confined to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
barter transactions for programming are used to supplement station program offerings 
advertising spots given up under these arrangements are based on contractual terms 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees salaries and benefits  commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are generally lowest in the first quarter 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
critical accounting estimates use of estimates our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the radio broadcasting industry 
an accounting estimate would be a critical accounting estimate for purposes of the disclosure in this report only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  contingencies and litigation  income taxes and fair value of financial instruments as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates that require the most significant judgments and assumptions and are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the preparation of the financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of fcc broadcast licenses  but also include goodwill and certain other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
we evaluate our fcc licenses for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
fcc licenses are evaluated for impairment at the market level using the direct method 
if the carrying amount of fcc licenses is greater than their estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of fcc licenses in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value 
based on our annual impairment test as of december   we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax to reduce the carrying value of our fcc licenses in the birmingham  greenville  honolulu  houston  jacksonville  louisville  richmond and southern connecticut markets to their estimated fair value 
we also evaluate goodwill in each of our reporting units markets for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain circumstances are present  using the residual method 
if the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit is greater than its implied value  determined from the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit is reduced to its estimated fair value 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the tulsa market to its estimated fair market value 

table of contents we utilize independent appraisals in testing fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment 
these appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
we evaluate amortizing intangible assets for recoverability when circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  using an undiscounted cash flow methodology 
if the future undiscounted cash flows for the intangible asset are less than net book value  net book value is reduced to the estimated fair value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific party s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other parties  the evaluation considers the balance of aged receivables  the nature and volume of the portfolio  specific problem accounts and notes receivable  and economic conditions that may affect the debtor s ability to repay  and such other factors as  in our judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
accounts and notes receivable are charged off to the allowance when  in our opinion  such receivables are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
in addition  we consider the customer s creditworthiness prior to revenue recognition 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income tax estimates the provision for income taxes is based on current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  changes in our operations in various jurisdictions  income tax rates and tax positions taken on returns 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the application and interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations 
in the normal course of business  our filed tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
these examinations could result in challenges to tax positions that we have taken 
these challenges could arise from a variety of tax issues such as the deductibility of certain expenses  the timing of the recognition of income and expense  allocations of income and expense between states  the tax basis of certain assets and the taxation of acquisitions and disposals 
ultimately  the results of these challenges could require us to pay additional taxes and could also require the payment of interest assessments 
cox radio adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

table of contents libor plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt  or the federal funds borrowing rate plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt 
the credit facility includes commitment fees on the unused portion of the total amount available  which fees range from to depending on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long term debt 
the credit facility contains  among other provisions  specified leverage and interest coverage requirements  the terms of which are defined within the credit facility

in august  we amended this agreement to increase the guarantee to up to million and to extend the expiration to june if our signal upgrade is approved by the fcc  then we are likely to purchase the stations and performance under the guarantee will not be necessary 
if the signal upgrade is not approved  our guarantee will be extinguished either through sale of the stations or through new financing arranged by the owner of the stations

however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse impact on our operating results 
transactions with affiliated companies we receive certain management services from  and have entered into certain transactions with  cox enterprises 
costs of the management services that are allocated to us are based on actual direct costs incurred or on cox enterprises estimate of expenses relative to the management services provided to other subsidiaries of cox enterprises 
we believe that these allocations were made on a reasonable basis  and that receiving these management services from cox enterprises creates cost efficiencies  however  there has been no study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what the cost of obtaining such services from third parties would have been 
the services and transactions described below have been reviewed by our audit committee  which has determined that such services and transactions are fair and in our best interest 
we receive day to day cash management services from cox enterprises  with settlements of outstanding balances between us and cox enterprises occurring periodically at market interest rates 
as a part of these services  cox enterprises transfers funds to cover our checks presented for payment and we record a book overdraft  which is classified as accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheets

in connection with these management services  we reimburse cox enterprises for payments made to third party vendors for certain goods and services provided to us under arrangements made by cox enterprises on behalf of cox enterprises and its affiliates  including cox radio 
we believe such arrangements allow us to receive such goods and services at more attractive pricing than we would be able to secure separately 
such reimbursed expenditures include insurance premiums for coverage through cox enterprises insurance program  which provides coverage for all of its affiliates  including cox radio 
rather than self insuring these risks  cox enterprises purchases insurance for a fixed premium cost from several insurance companies  including an insurance company indirectly owned by descendants of governor james m

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
we have examined exposures to these risks and concluded that none of the exposures in these areas are material to cash flows or earnings  however  our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to changes in interest rates 
we have historically engaged in several strategies to manage these market risks 
we had one interest rate swap agreement for purposes of managing borrowing costs which expired in september pursuant to that interest rate swap agreement  we exchanged our floating rate interest obligations on million in notional principal amount of debt for a fixed annual interest rate of 
concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in january  we formally designated the agreement as a cash flow hedge as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of the swap agreement  based on then current market rates  approximated a net payable of million at december  we estimated fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies that we believed to be appropriate 
considerable judgment  however  is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimate of fair value 
accordingly  the estimate was not necessarily indicative of the amount that we would realize or pay in a current market exchange 
the estimated fair values of debt instruments are based on discounted cash flow analyses using our borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations 
the revolving credit facilities and cox enterprises borrowings bear interest based on current market rates and  thus  approximate fair value 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to these variable rate debt instruments 
if the libor borrowing rates were to increase above the current rates at december   our interest expense on the revolving credit facility would increase approximately million on an annual basis
