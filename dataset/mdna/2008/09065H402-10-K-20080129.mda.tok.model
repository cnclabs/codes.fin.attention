overview since its founding in  biopure has been primarily a research and development company focused on developing hemopure  the company s oxygen therapeutic for human use  and obtaining regulatory approval in the united states and other markets 
the company s research and development expenses have been devoted to basic research  product development  process development  preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory activity 
in addition  the company s development expenses in the past included the design  construction  validation and maintenance of a large scale pilot manufacturing plant in cambridge  massachusetts 
a manufacturing facility is a necessary part of developing a product like hemopure 
the fda classifies hemopure as a biologic because it is derived from animal source material 
unlike drugs that are chemical compounds  biologics are defined by their manufacturing process and composition 
under fda regulations  any change in the manufacturing process could be considered to produce an altered  possibly different product 
therefore  it is necessary to demonstrate manufacturing capability at greater than laboratory scale for an application for regulatory approval of a biologic to be accepted for review 
this requirement has resulted in high manufacturing research and development costs in the development of our products relative to other types of drugs 
prior to  the company only manufactured product for use in preclinical and clinical trials  and production costs were charged wholly to research and development 
as an offshoot of the research and development for hemopure  oxyglobin  a similar product  gained marketing approval for veterinary use in the us in and in the european union in following the us approval  oxyglobin was produced for sale in the pilot manufacturing plant that was built and maintained primarily for the development of hemopure 
because of this marketing approval  costs of production of oxyglobin for sale and an allocation of manufacturing overhead based on capacity used for oxyglobin are charged to inventory and to cost of revenues 
since marketing approval of hemopure for human use was granted in south africa in  costs of production of hemopure for sale and an allocation of manufacturing overhead based on capacity used for hemopure have been charged to inventory and to cost of revenues 
a substantial majority of our costs comprise research and development and cost of revenues 
the revenues from products we now market defray some of the manufacturing costs we must incur to keep our substantial plant operational as we manufacture hemopure for clinical trials and maintain readiness for greater volume manufacturing 
we also receive governmental reimbursements of research and development costs for development of hemopure for use in trauma 
our research and development activities in include the clinical trials described under business 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the application of our critical accounting policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require us to make subjective judgments in determining estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following critical accounting policies meet these characteristics and are considered most significant inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method or market 
inventories consist of raw material  work in process and hemopure and oxyglobin finished goods 
inventories 
table of contents are reviewed periodically to identify expired units and units with a remaining life too short to be commercially viable  based on projected sales activity  or for use in the proposed resus clinical trial 
inventories are also subject to internal quality compliance investigations 
inventory that is not expected to be utilized based on projected demand or fails quality assessment is written off 
the inventory of hemopure finished goods represents the units the company expects to sell in south africa or use in preclinical and clinical studies where payment is received for the trial material 
the company has been and expects to continue to be reimbursed for the cost of units to be used in a proposed trauma trial to be conducted by or on behalf of the nmrc 
any units expected to be consumed by the company in its own preclinical or clinical trials are expensed to research and development when manufactured 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas r  beginning november   using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires us to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date the award is made and to recognize cost over the requisite service period 
under the modified prospective transition method  financial statements for periods prior to the date of adoption are not retrospectively adjusted 
however  compensation expense is recognized for a all share based payments granted after the effective date under sfas r  and b all awards granted under sfas to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
we recognize compensation expense on fixed awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
prior to november   we used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
consequently  we did not recognize compensation expense in association with options granted at or above the market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
as of october   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense  net of forfeitures  related to non vested market based share awards  that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and analysis of the impact of adoption in our statement of operations 
long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our investments in property and equipment  such as construction in progress  real property license rights related to the source  supply and initial processing of our major raw material  and the asset related to expenditures on engineering and plans for a large scale manufacturing facility we plan to build in south carolina have been the principal long lived assets subject to such a review 
pursuant to sfas  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed our long lived assets for potential impairment 
regarding the design and engineering asset related to the planned south carolina manufacturing facility  we have experienced continued delays in obtaining financing for this facility and in our plans to construct this facility 
in addition  we have experienced significant delays in our activities  including clinical and us regulatory delays  toward marketing authorization for hemopure in the united states or another jurisdiction with a sizeable market 
we have also modified our clinical development strategy and are focusing increasing efforts on the approval of hemopure in european countries 
we are unable to reliably project the timing of a need for a new plant given the continued delays  uncertainties in drug development and uncertainties about our ability to gain regulatory approval in a major market 
consequently  pursuant to sfas  we recorded a one time  non cash impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal to fully impair the design and engineering asset 
however  if hemopure is approved for an indication with broad application in a major market  we believe that at some point in the future we would ultimately exceed our existing plant capacity and require the construction of a facility using these designs 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of hemopure and oxyglobin upon shipment  provided that there is evidence of a final arrangement  there are no uncertainties surrounding acceptance  title has passed  collectability is probable and the price is fixed or determinable 
hemopure marketing in south africa is directed toward doctors in hospitals in both the private and government sectors 
we sell oxyglobin directly to veterinarians in the united states and to a distributor in the united kingdom for resale in the european union 
collectability is reasonably assured once pricing arrangements are established  as these arrangements establish the distributor s intent to pay 
our customers do not have a right to return product 
we monitor creditworthiness on a regular basis and believe collectability of product revenues is reasonably assured at the time of sale 
we recognize revenue from the us military upon invoicing for reimbursable expenses incurred in connection with developing hemopure for a trauma indication 
amounts received for future inventory purchases  recorded as deferred revenue  will be recognized as sales upon shipment in accordance with the provisions discussed above 
results of operations as we generate net losses  the key drivers of the losses are cost of revenues  research and development and other expenses consisting of sales and marketing and general and administrative 
inflation and changing prices have not had a significant impact on our revenues or loss from operations in the three years ended october  for fiscal  and  these items were as follows in thousands percent of percent of percent of amount total costs amount total costs amount total costs revenues product revenues research and development revenue cost of revenues oxyglobin hemopure total cost of revenues research and development impairment charge engineering and design asset  n a sales and marketing oxyglobin hemopure total sales and marketing general and administrative total costs other than a one time  non cash impairment charge 
fiscal years ended october  and our revenues consisted of sales of oxyglobin and hemopure and funds received from the us government 
revenues from sales of oxyglobin increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to an increase in the sales price of oxyglobin and to a change in arrangements between biopure and its european distributor 
in we accounted for european sales on a consignment basis 
now the distributor purchases the product outright 

table of contents revenues from sales of hemopure were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  due to our marketing efforts and increasing use of the product 
during fiscal and  we received  and  respectively  from past congressional appropriations to reimburse us for certain trauma development expenses 
we have recorded these funds as revenue in connection with research and development activities 
these payments vary relative to the amount of reimbursable activity we are conducting 
cost of revenues includes costs of both oxyglobin and hemopure 
hemopure cost of revenues  which includes the allocation of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs  was  less in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily because of higher inventory write offs in charged to cost of revenues  partially offset by higher spending in fiscal oxyglobin cost of revenues increased in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal primarily due to higher unit sales in the united kingdom 
research and development expenses include preclinical studies  clinical trials and clinical trial materials 
in we began to focus on developing hemopure for a potential indication in cardiovascular ischemia and on supporting the us navy s government funded efforts to develop a potential out of hospital trauma indication 
prior to that time  our primary focus was on one major project the final phases of hemopure development for its use in patients undergoing surgery 
during fiscal  we applied in the uk for regulatory approval of a proposed orthopedic surgical anemia indication 
a breakdown of our research and development expenses by major activity is as follows in thousands ischemia program trauma program ischemia and trauma programs the ischemia program is in early clinical trials 
the nmrc is seeking fda authorization to conduct a phase trial in trauma patients with our support  but its proposed application to begin the trial is on clinical hold 
cumulative ischemia project expenditures of million as of october   consist of the costs of preparing and carrying out pilot clinical trials in europe and south africa 
cumulative trauma expenditures of million as of october   consist of costs primarily associated with preclinical trials  protocol and study design for the proposed nmrc sponsored out of hospital trauma trial 
of these expenses  million has been reimbursed to date by payments administered by the us army 
additional expenses for either an ischemia indication or for a trauma indication cannot be estimated with precision at this time 
the risks and uncertainties associated with the early stage of planning and execution of the ischemia and trauma clinical development programs include  among other things  uncertainties about results that at any time could require us to abandon or greatly modify either project 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the period in which material net cash inflows for either of these two projects might commence  if ever 
expenses the increase in research and development in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a  increase in salaries expense and an increase in spending on trauma and ischemia related preclinical studies 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in expenses related to the filing of a marketing application in the united kingdom in fiscal  for which there were no comparable expenses in the  in army reimbursements recorded as revenue during fiscal  as explained above  related to research and development activities and preclinical studies 
the impairment charge shown above represents a one time  non cash charge  recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of engineering and design of a planned large scale manufacturing facility 
the company determined this asset was impaired pursuant to sfas  primarily due to continued delays and uncertainties of future estimates  and recorded the impairment charge accordingly 
see notes  and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents hemopure and oxyglobin related sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from  in the increase was primarily due to market research and public affairs activities in the united kingdom 
expenses in south africa increased by  in fiscal compared to mostly due to a charge for product donated in south africa to promote adoption and use of hemopure 
we expect oxyglobin sales and marketing expenses to be consistent in fiscal with those in fiscal general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreases of  in insurance premiums   in legal expenses and  in severance expenses 
fiscal years ended october  and our revenues consisted primarily of sales of oxyglobin and funds received from the us army 
revenues from sales of oxyglobin increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal  mostly due to an increase in the sales price of oxyglobin 
in fiscal  we recorded the first sales of hemopure  representing the first sales ever of a hemoglobin based oxygen therapeutic for human use 
revenues from these sales totaled  for the fiscal year 
biopure attributes the low level of sales to the high cost of hemopure compared with allogenic red blood cells rbcs  when available  the fact that allogenic rbcs are considered safe in south africa  and the lack of private medical insurer or governmental reimbursement for the product 
we had anticipated low sales before we began to market  because hemopure marketing is limited to use in surgery 
during fiscal and  we received  and  respectively  from past congressional appropriations administered by the us army to reimburse us for certain trauma development expenses 
we have recorded these funds as revenue in connection with research and development activities supporting the trauma program 
the payments from the government vary relative to the amount of reimbursable activity we are conducting 
cost of revenues includes costs of both oxyglobin and hemopure 
hemopure cost of revenues  which includes the allocation of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs  decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal oxyglobin cost of revenues also decreased in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal these decreases for both hemopure and oxyglobin cost of revenues were primarily due to an impairment charge  in fiscal  of million 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we revised the projected start date of the us navy s proposed resus clinical trial of hemopure due to the fda s clinical hold placed on this proposed trial 
this revision in turn delayed the expected need for expanded production facilities 
as a result  we determined that impairment existed on certain specific manufacturing equipment and recorded a one time  non cash write down of million on this equipment 
there was no comparable impairment charge in fiscal research and development expenses include preclinical studies  clinical trials and clinical trial materials 
in we changed our corporate strategy to focus on developing hemopure for a potential indication in cardiovascular ischemia and on supporting the us navy s government funded efforts to develop a potential out of hospital trauma indication 
prior to that time  our primary focus was on one major project the final phases of hemopure development for its use in patients undergoing surgery 
in addition  during fiscal  we applied in the uk for regulatory approval of a proposed orthopedic surgical anemia indication 
a breakdown of our research and development expenses by major activity is as follows in thousands ischemia program trauma program ischemia and trauma programs both the ischemia and the trauma programs are in early stages ie  safety clinical trials and preclinical animal studies although the nmrc is seeking fda authorization to conduct a phase trial in trauma patients 
regulatory agency requirements for additional clinical trials and any further preclinical studies that might be necessary for either an ischemia indication or for use in trauma patients cannot be estimated at this time 
the risks and uncertainties associated with the early stage of planning and execution of the ischemia and trauma clinical 
table of contents development programs include  among other things  uncertainties about results that at any time could require us to abandon or greatly modify either project 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the period in which material net cash inflows for either of these two projects might commence  if ever  and we do not expect to obtain marketing approval of a potential ischemia indication or trauma indication for several years 
expenses the increase in research and development in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as shown in the table above  was primarily due to a million increase in salaries expense  expenses related to the filing of a marketing application in july in the united kingdom  for which there were no comparable expenses in  and  in stock based compensation expense recorded under sfas r 
these increases were partially offset by lower spending on trauma and ischemia related preclinical studies 
the  in reimbursements recorded as revenue during fiscal  as explained above  related to research and development activities and preclinical studies 
hemopure and oxyglobin related sales and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to expenses for a sales agent for hemopure in south africa  which were partially offset by lower salary expenses 
we did not have a sales agent in south africa during fiscal we agreed in late to an early termination of the agreement with the sales agent in south africa 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreases of million in severance expenses   in outside services   in insurance premiums and  in audit and tax related expenses in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we expensed  relating to a contract termination  and  for restructuring costs associated with vacated office space 
general and administrative cost increases in comprise stock based compensation expense  explained above  and higher legal fees and expenses arising out of the pending derivative litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
since october   we have raised approximately million  before expenses of approximately million  in additional financing see note  to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect this funding  in addition to the cash and cash equivalents at october   to be sufficient to fund operations into july we expect to continue to explore opportunities to raise capital  through sales of equity securities and  if appropriate  to consider strategic collaborations 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each year was primarily attributable to our recurring net losses 
in fiscal  financing activities provided us with million in cash  primarily from the sale of common stock and warrants 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at october  payments due by period less than year years years total in thousands operating leases as explained above  in we entered into a crada with the nmrc 
as part of the crada the navy paid approximately million for future inventory purchases  recorded in the accompanying financial statements as current portion of deferred revenue and deferred revenue  net of current portion 
if the navy were to decide not to continue to pursue the resus project described in the crada  we could be required to return the million 
as of october   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal and state taxable income through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate realization of such prior losses  no benefit has been recognized in our financial statements as of october  net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities and to provide additional information that will help investors and other financial statement users to easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
additionally  sfas no 
requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  beginning with the company s fiscal year 
early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
 but does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation requires that the company recognize in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning with the company s fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its financial statements  but does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fas  fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   beginning with the company s fiscal year although earlier application is encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on its financial statements  but does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
in sfas r  the fasb retained the fundamental requirements of statement no 
to account for all business combinations using the acquisition method formerly the purchase method and for an acquiring entity to be identified in all business combinations 
however  the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for annual periods beginning on or after december  beginning with the company s fiscal year 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that sfas r will have on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange risks  with the exception of minimal exchange fluctuations associated with expenses for clinical trial  regulatory and sales and marketing activities outside of the united states and minimal sales in south africa 
we sell oxyglobin in europe in us dollars 
the customers bear the risk of foreign currency exchange fluctuation 
we sell hemopure in south africa in local currency 
fluctuations in revenues in south africa are offset by fluctuations in our local expenses 
dramatic fluctuations in exchange rates could result in either increases or decreases in unit sales  as the effective unit price to the customer would vary 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that the interest rate risk exposure is not material
