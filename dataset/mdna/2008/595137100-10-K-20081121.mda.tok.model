in fiscal year  we recorded  in additional severance 
the increase in severance relates to additional payments expected to be made due to a closing schedule that extended beyond initial estimates 
other restructuring related expenses  primarily for travel  planning and equipment relocation  were recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities sfas 

table of contents the consolidation of broomfield is expected to result  subsequent to its completion  in annual cost savings of million to million from the elimination of redundant resources and related expenses and employee reductions 
costs associated with the consolidation of broomfield are estimated to range from million to million  excluding any gain or loss from future dispositions of the plant and property 
broomfield has approximately employees and occupies a  square foot owned facility 
broomfield shipped approximately  and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we currently anticipate that broomfield will cease operations in fiscal year the following table reflects the activities related to the consolidation of broomfield and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the date below amounts in thousands employee severance other related costs total balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  in february  advanced power technology  inc apt announced the planned closure of its facility in montgomeryville  pennsylvania and the relocation of remaining manufacturing activities to its santa clara  california facility 
microsemi acquired apt  which was renamed microsemi corp 
power products group ppg  in july and determined that the fair value of the restructuring liability at the time of acquisition was  we did not substantially modify the restructuring plan subsequent to the acquisition 
in fiscal year  we recorded  in additional severance expense in accordance with sfas and  in lease termination fees 
the lease termination was not contemplated at the time of the acquisition of ppg 
there were no ppg facility closures in fiscal year the following table reflects restructuring activities at ppg and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance other related costs total balance at october  provisions cash expenditures balance at september  in may  we announced that that we will retain our manufacturing operations in ennis  ireland to meet the increasing demand for our high reliability defense and commercial air satellite products

 chapter sfas  as applicable 
acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal year  we acquired substantially all the assets of microwave device technology corporation and all the common stock of tsi microelectronics corporation for million in cash  net of cash acquired 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we acquired substantially all the assets of semicoa for approximately million  including million in cash consideration to semicoa and certain creditors  the assumption of approximately million in liabilities  million related to a lease agreement with a party related to semicoa shareholders and million in estimated transaction fees and expenses 
we funded these acquisitions with cash on hand 
other than a million charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year for in process research and development  these transactions did not significantly impact results of operations and on a pro forma basis would not be material to our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  on october   we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with powerdsine ltd 
powerdsine  an israeli corporation  and pinnacle acquisition corporation  ltd  an israeli corporation that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi 
the merger agreement provided for a merger of our subsidiary into powerdsine 
we completed the acquisition of powerdsine on january  and under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued of a share of microsemi common stock and paid in cash for each powerdsine ordinary share  resulting in the issuance in the aggregate of approximately million shares with a fair market value of approximately million  based on microsemi s average closing price between october  and october  and a cash payment of approximately million 
we converted equity awards issued by powerdsine and valued vested awards at million 
direct transaction fees and expenses were million and an additional million was placed into escrow for the cash consideration on converted unvested powerdsine restricted share awards 
this amount will be paid to employees as their restricted share awards vest 
an additional million in transaction costs were accrued by powerdsine prior to the acquisition and subsequently paid by microsemi 
we financed this transaction with cash on hand and through additional borrowings of approximately million on our credit line 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained herein 

table of contents revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we recognize revenue to all customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenues are recognized at the time the product is shipped to customers 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors and these contracts permit very limited stock rotation returns 
we provides an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenues have been within management s expectations 
we generally provide a one year product defect warranty from the date of sale 
historically  warranty costs have been nominal and have been within management s expectations 
investment in available for sale securities we invest cash balances in excess of projected liquidity needs primarily in money market funds and auction rate securities 
all of our investments to date have maintained triple a ratings  however  recent credit market disruptions  particularly related to auction rate securities  may adversely affect the ratings of our investments 
at september   our investment in auction rate securities consisted of auction rate preferred shares and auction rate bonds whose principal and interest are federally guaranteed by the family federal education loan program 
we previously had a practice of investing in auction rate securities and selling the securities prior to our interim and year end reporting periods 
we purchased the auction rate securities held at september  in january and began to experience auction failures beginning in mid february that have impacted the liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities 
auction failures do not represent a default of the security 
while some issuers of auction rate securities have announced intentions to call these securities at par plus accrued interest  there remains a high degree of uncertainty as to when complete liquidity may be restored 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with the financial institution where we hold our investments in auction rate securities and per the terms of the settlement agreement a on november   the financial institution repurchased our million investment in auction rate preferred shares at par plus accrued interest  b we hold rights to sell our million investment in auction rate bonds back to the financial institution at par plus accrued interest beginning june   and c we are permitted to borrow at no net cost the full par value of our investment in auction rate bonds 
based on the no net cost loan feature of the settlement  we have the ability to convert the auction rate bonds to cash within our normal operating cycle  and as such  we have classified these investments in current assets 
should credit market disruptions continue or increase in magnitude  we may be required to record an impairment on our investments or consider that an ultimate liquidity event may take longer than currently anticipated 
at september   we concluded that any potential other than temporary impairment in the fair value of our auction rate securities would be offset substantially by the value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement 
however  given that there is currently no active secondary market for our investment in auction rate securities  the determination of fair market value in the future could be negatively impacted by factors including  but not limited to  failure of the financial institution to perform  continuing illiquidity in the market for auction rate securities for an extended period of time  a lack of action by the issuers to establish different forms of financing to replace or redeem these securities  changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities and in market interest rates above contractual maximum interest rates on the underlying 
table of contents auction rate securities 
we currently do not anticipate additional impairment of our investments  however  if we had to record any impairment  for every decline in principal  a pre tax decrease in value of approximately million would occur 
while it is our current assessment that this financial institution is well capitalized and able to meet its obligations with regards to the settlement  given the current uncertainty in the financial services sector  we are subject to counterparty risk with regards to the settlement 
should this financial institution be unable to meet its obligation with regards to the settlement agreement  neither the credit ratings nor the guarantee of the family federal education loan program would be directly affected  however  we may not be able to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities until after june  or at all 
at september   all of our marketable securities were classified as available for sale and accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
unrealized gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income unless the decline in the fair values is below cost and deemed to be other than temporary  in which case the adjustment is recorded to earnings 
if fair values were to decrease below cost for a prolonged period of time  we would consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an other than temporary impairment charge  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below the cost basis  the current financial condition of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amounts shown in the balance sheet are trade account receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for possible returns and doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience and specifically identified accounts 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
with the exception of one distributor who entered into bankruptcy and for whom we charged off approximately million against the allowance for doubtful accounts in fiscal  actual bad debt has been within our expectations and the provisions established  and has been consistent with experience of prior years  however  any unexpected significant adverse change in the financial position of any of our major customers or any group of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
the total evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of our products  and market and economic conditions 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if we are unable to meet our sales expectations  or if market conditions 
table of contents deteriorate from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of our inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
an evaluation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will recognize an impairment loss which equals to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenues and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas at the beginning of fiscal year  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  while those intangible assets with known useful lives have continued to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings  which equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its then fair value  and a reduction in goodwill on our balance sheet 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we performed our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed 
accounting for income taxes in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas income tax positions must meet a 
table of contents more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
we adopted fin effective october   and the provisions of fin will be applied to all income tax positions commencing from that date 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we file us federal  state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitation 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
we establish liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including  but not limited to  international tax issues and certain tax credits 
we do not believe the results of these audits will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
share based payment fas r to account for stock based compensation under the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  fair value of new and previously granted but unvested stock options are recognized as compensation expense in the income statement  and prior period results are not restated 
under fas r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments 
results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales increased million or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands commercial air satellite defense industrial semicap medical mobile connectivity notebook lcd tv display 
table of contents net sales in the commercial air satellite end market increased million from million in to million in the increase was primarily driven by demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  as well as growing electronic content in current aircraft 
we believe that announced delays in certain commercial aircraft programs will be offset by higher production of other aircraft types to replace aging and less fuel efficient models  as well as increased refurbishment programs 
additionally  we believe that there is demand for commercial satellites and radar systems  especially with higher planned launch levels and expansion of airports in asia 
net sales in the defense end market increased million from million in to million in net sales in this end market continued to be solid with high historical demand  increasing electronic content in defense equipment and continual funding of new programs 
we believe that growth areas include military avionics  ground transportation  surveillance equipment  joint service communications systems  naval vessels  radars  missiles and advanced combat unit electronics 
based on our backlog and anticipated increases in both domestic and international defense spending  we expect to see increasing sales in this end market 
net sales in the industrial semicap market decreased million from million in to million in  with the decrease primarily attributable to a decrease in sales for use in semicap applications 
net sales in our fiscal fourth quarter grew modestly  due to higher sales of industrial applications 
we believe this market will be stable in the upcoming quarters with emerging alternative energy applications contributing to potential growth 
net sales in the medical end market increased million  from million in to million in increasing functionality and device integration in implantable medical devices  such as defibrillators and pacemakers  have resulted in increases in both dollars per unit and unit content per device 
we received a large purchase order related to implantable medical components that we expect to fill over approximately the twelve months of fiscal year that will contribute to growth in this end market 
based on our current bookings  we expect continuing strength in the implantable medical business in upcoming quarters 
net sales in the mobile connectivity end market increased million  from million in to million in net sales in this end market have grown due primarily to the addition of contributions from powerdsine  which we acquired in the second quarter of we expect to see strong demand for our wlan power amplifier products  especially with the ongoing ramp up of n networking solutions and an increase in our customer base 
however  as enterprise demand has waned in the current economic environment  net sales of power over ethernet products are expected to decline and contribute to lower net sales in the upcoming quarters 
net sales in the notebook lcd television display end market increased million  from million in to million in compared to  we gained market share in our lcd tv business for ccfl with notable design win strength with tier customers in japan and korea 
we also saw strong interest in our next generation backlighting solutions and notebook design wins 
lcd tv remains the largest component of this end market and leading lcd tv manufacturers and panel suppliers have noted slowing demand 
in total  we expect a decline in this end market in the upcoming quarters 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia total 
table of contents between fiscal years and  net sales originating from the united states decreased million while net sales originating from europe and asia increased million and million  respectively 
this shift in originating geographic area was due primarily to our decision to shift the fulfillment of some customer orders directly from our locations in europe and asia rather than through our locations in the united states 
net sales originating in asia also increased due to the contributions of powerdsine  ltd  which we acquired in the second quarter of gross profit increased million  from million of sales for to million of sales for the increase in gross profit was due to higher sales 
gross profit percentage increased primarily due to progress in our facility rationalization  which has reallocated production  particularly to our ireland manufacturing facility  based on manufacturing costs  efficiencies and capabilities at each of our facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million for to million for the changes were an million increase in stock based compensation and a million increase primarily related to higher selling costs to support increased sales 
research and development expense increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to the addition of research and development expense incurred at powerdsine 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  poe  ccfl and led drivers  class d audio amplifiers  ingap rf power amplifiers for wireless lan applications  development and adoption of silicon carbide technology  vdmos products for high frequency communications and s band products for rf applications 
we incurred a million charge from the powerdsine acquisition in and million charge from the ppg acquisition in for in process research and development ipr d 
we incurred a further ipr d charge of million in related to our acquisition of microwave device technology corporation 
ipr d represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technologies that  as of the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility  and was thus immediately expensed 
the ipr d projects associated with the powerdsine acquisition were valued through the application of discounted cash flow analyses  taking into account key characteristics of each technology including its future prospects  the rate of technological change in the industry  product life cycles  risks specific to the project  and the project s stage of completion 
stage of completion was estimated by considering the time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition  versus the project s overall expected cost  effort and risks required for achieving technological feasibility 
in the application of the discounted cash flow analyses  powerdsine s management provided a revenue forecast for each ipr d project 
the projection was based on the expected date of market introduction  an assessment of customer needs  the expected pricing and cost structure of the related products  product life cycles  and the importance of existing technology relative to the in process technology 
in addition  the costs expected to complete the project were added to the operating expenses to calculate the operating income for each ipr d project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the assets being valued  returns to these other assets were calculated and deducted from the pre tax operating income to isolate the economic benefit solely attributable to each of the in process technologies 
the present value of ipr d was calculated based on discount rates recommended by the american institute of certified public accountants ipr d practice aid  which depends on the stage of completion and the additional risk associated with the completion of the ipr d project 
the earnings associated with the incomplete technologies were discounted at a rate of  two percentage points higher than the powerdsine s cost of capital 

table of contents interest expense was million lower in versus in  we incurred interest expense on borrowings from our credit facility for temporary funding of the powerdsine acquisition 
interest income was million lower in versus primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments 
the effective income tax rate was in  primarily due to the non deductibility of acquisition related charges such as in process research and development and other transactions related to the powerdsine acquisition 
these charges increased the income tax rate by percentage points 
the effective income tax rate was in the effective tax rate was impacted by a shift of income earned to lower tax rate jurisdictions 
capital resources and liquidity in  we financed our operations with cash from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million from million in to million in significant factors that increased net cash provided by operating activities included higher net income of million  which included a higher stock based compensation charge of million  and lower gain on disposition of assets of million  offset by lower charges for in process research and development of million 
in addition  net cash from operating activities increased million due higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million due to lower inventories  million due to higher long term liabilities primarily related to fin  million due to higher income taxes payable and million due to lower other current assets  and decreased million due to higher accounts receivable  million due to lower deferred income taxes 
we invest cash balances in excess of projected liquidity needs primarily in money market funds and auction rate securities 
all of our investments to date have maintained triple a ratings  however  recent credit market disruptions  particularly related to auction rate securities  may adversely affect the ratings of our investments 
at september   our investment in auction rate securities consisted of auction rate preferred shares and auction rate bonds whose principal and interest are federally guaranteed by the family federal education loan program 
we previously had a practice of investing in auction rate securities and selling the securities prior to our interim and year end reporting periods 
we purchased the auction rate securities held at september  in january and began to experience auction failures beginning in mid february that have impacted the liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities 
auction failures do not represent a default of the security 
while some issuers of auction rate securities have announced intentions to call these securities at par plus accrued interest  there remains a high degree of uncertainty as to when complete liquidity may be restored and there is currently no active secondary market 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with the financial institution where we hold our investments in auction rate securities and per the terms of the settlement agreement a on november   the financial institution repurchased our million investment in auction rate preferred shares at par plus accrued interest  b we hold rights to sell our million investment in auction rate bonds back to the financial institution at par plus accrued interest beginning june   and c we are permitted to borrow at no net cost the full par value of our investment in auction rate bonds 
based on the no net cost loan feature of the settlement  we have the ability to convert the auction rate bonds to cash within our normal operating cycle  and as such  we have classified these investments in current assets 
there can be no assurance that the financial institution will have sufficient assets in the future to repurchase our auction rate bonds if and when we exercise our right to sell such bonds to the financial institution 
while it is our current assessment that this financial institution is well capitalized and able to meet its obligations with regards to the settlement  given the current uncertainty in the financial services sector  we are subject to counterparty risk with regards to the settlement 
should this financial institution be unable to meet its obligation with regards to the settlement agreement  neither the credit ratings nor the guarantee of the family federal education loan program would be directly affected  however  we may not be able to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities until after june  or at all 

table of contents accounts receivable increased million from million at september  to million at september  the increase in receivables was due primarily to an increase in net sales 
inventories increased million from million at september  to million at september  inventories increased primarily due to higher inventory levels to support higher net sales  offset by the filling of backlog on high reliability parts and improvements in operational efficiencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in credit risk  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates or the stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  which are related to credit risks  changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and changes in certain interest rates 

table of contents we invest cash balances in excess of projected liquidity needs primarily in money market funds and auction rate securities 
all of our investments to date have maintained triple a ratings  however  recent credit market disruptions  particularly related to auction rate securities  may adversely affect the ratings of our investments 
at september   our investment in auction rate securities consisted of auction rate preferred shares and auction rate bonds whose principal and interest are federally guaranteed by the family federal education loan program 
we previously had a practice of investing in auction rate securities and selling the securities prior to our interim and year end reporting periods 
we purchased the auction rate securities held at september  in january and began to experience auction failures beginning in mid february that have impacted the liquidity of our investment in auction rate securities 
auction failures do not represent a default of the security 
while some issuers of auction rate securities have announced intentions to call these securities at par plus accrued interest  there remains a high degree of uncertainty as to when complete liquidity may be restored 
we have entered into a settlement agreement with the financial institution where we hold our investments in auction rate securities and per the terms of the settlement agreement a on november   the financial institution repurchased our million investment in auction rate preferred shares at par plus accrued interest  b we hold rights to sell our million investment in auction rate bonds back to the financial institution at par plus accrued interest beginning june   and c we are permitted to borrow at no net cost the full par value of our investment in auction rate bonds 
based on the no net cost loan feature of the settlement  we have the ability to convert the auction rate bonds to cash within our normal operating cycle  and as such  we have classified these investments in current assets 
should credit market disruptions continue or increase in magnitude  we may be required to record an impairment on our investments or consider that an ultimate liquidity event may take longer than currently anticipated 
at september   we concluded that any potential other than temporary impairment in the fair value of our auction rate securities would be offset substantially by the value recognized for the rights provided to us in the settlement agreement 
however  given that there is currently no active secondary market for our investment in auction rate securities  the determination of fair market value in the future could be negatively impacted by factors including  but not limited to  failure of the financial institution to perform  continuing illiquidity in the market for auction rate securities for an extended period of time  a lack of action by the issuers to establish different forms of financing to replace or redeem these securities  changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities and in market interest rates above contractual maximum interest rates on the underlying auction rate securities 
we currently do not anticipate additional impairment of our investments  however  if we had to record any impairment  for every decline in principal  a pre tax decrease in value of approximately million would occur 
while it is our current assessment that this financial institution is well capitalized and able to meet its obligations with regards to the settlement  given the current uncertainty in the financial services sector  we are subject to counterparty risk with regards to the settlement 
should this financial institution be unable to meet its obligation with regards to the settlement agreement  neither the credit ratings nor the guarantee of the family federal education loan program would be directly affected  however  we may not be able to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities until after june  or at all 
we conduct a relatively small portion of our business in a number of foreign currencies  principally the european union euro  british pound  israeli shekel and chinese rmb 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 

table of contents we did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or to hedge exposure to interest rate risks 
our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
accordingly  we have not engaged in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement dated as of december  with comerica bank the revolving credit agreement with maximum available borrowing amounts set at million  million and million in the agreement s first  second and third years  respectively

as of september   we were in compliance with the financial covenants required by the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement is subject to our satisfaction and performance of various affirmative and negative covenants 
the negative covenants include  among others  limitations on material corporate transactions  borrowing  the creation of liens  sales of assets  acquisitions  mergers  and investments 
there is no assurance possible that such restrictions will be waived 
these covenants might  unless waived  deter some strategic corporate transactions or acquisitions that could have otherwise possibly enhanced value for our stockholders 
any real or alleged default by us under any of our obligations under the revolving credit agreement could have material adverse consequences for our business and could materially adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
the revolving credit agreement is unsecured  which means that each of our assets is not subject to a lien  security interest or other encumbrance 
however  we are subject to restrictions under the revolving credit agreement against asset dispositions or financings  without the lender s prior written consent  or waiver  which may be granted or denied in the lender s discretion 
in addition to our corporate parent company  microsemi corporation  several of our subsidiaries are also parties to the revolving credit agreement  as follows microsemi corp 
power products group  microsemi corp 
integrated products  microsemi corp 
massachusetts and microsemi corp 
scottsdale 
the obligations of each company are joint and several under the revolving credit agreement 
unless we are in compliance with the terms of the revolving credit agreement  our subsidiaries cannot pay us any dividends 
the position of the lender is and always shall be superior to our position as a stockholder of the subsidiaries 
a sale or transfer of any of the parties to the revolving credit agreement is subject to the lender s consent and approval 
this may  depending on the circumstances  possibly impede a strategic corporate transaction that otherwise might have been possible and might have been in the best interest of our stockholders 
in the future  other persons may from time to time become parties to the revolving credit agreement  as lenders or otherwise
