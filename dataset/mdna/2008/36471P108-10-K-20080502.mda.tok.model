overview gander mountain company operates the nation s largest retail network of stores specializing in hunting  fishing  camping  marine and outdoor lifestyle products and services 
we have expanded our store base to conveniently located gander mountain outdoor lifestyle stores  providing approximately million square feet of retail space in states alabama  arkansas  colorado  florida  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky  maryland  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  new york  north carolina  north dakota  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas  virginia  west virginia and wisconsin 
we anticipate opening five new stores in  including one relocation and the consolidation of two smaller format stores into one large format store 
our core strategy is to provide our target customers with a unique and broad assortment of outdoor equipment  accessories  related technical apparel and footwear  expert services  convenient locations and value pricing 
our stores feature an extensive selection of leading national and regional brands as well as our company s owned brands 
we tailor our merchandise assortments to take advantage of our customers seasonal and regional or local preferences 
we seek to combine this broad product offering with superior customer service based on our store associates extensive product knowledge and outdoor related experience 
since its origin in  our brand name has developed a strong appeal and relevance to consumers who participate in outdoor sports and recreation activities 
our customers value our we live outdoors culture and theme 
from to  our predecessor operated a nationwide catalog business that  by  included retail stores 
in and  holiday companies  which at the time owned and operated a group of retail sporting goods stores  acquired these gander mountain retail stores  formed our company and began to build a new outdoor lifestyle business utilizing the historic gander mountain brand 
in march  we began transforming our market position from a traditional specialty store to a large format  category focused store 
we did this by opening new stores in a large format and increasing the selling space within our original  small format stores 
prior to march  our typical store was approximately  square feet 
our large format stores range from approximately  to  square feet  with our current focus primarily upon stores of  to  square feet plus an outside selling area 
our large format stores are generally located with convenient access to a major highway and have an open style shopping environment characterized by wide aisles  open bar joist ceilings and high density racking 
to further build upon our brand s reputation for high quality and exceptional value  we are outfitting certain stores and our new stores with additional features such as brick and stone accents  log wrapped columns  and improved branding  fixture  flooring and signage elements 
as of february   of our stores were in our large format 
the larger format enables us to offer more products and services to our customers 
in we began offering the arctic cat brand of all terrain vehicles atvs in our large format stores 
in spring we began to feature the popular tracker marine group boat brands in our stores  including tracker and fisher fishing boats  sun tracker and fisher pontoon boats  nitro and procraft high performance fishing boats  tahoe runabout deck boats  mako offshore inshore fishing boats  and kenner bay boats 
to support these efforts we began to offer power shop services in our larger stores  including maintenance and repairs for atvs  boats and other small engines 
we have learned that we can be most successful offering atvs  boats and related power shop services in selected markets based on market demand  competitive conditions and customer preferences 
as of fiscal year end  we had reduced the number of our large format stores offering atvs and tracker brand boats to and  respectively 
our large format stores offer other unique features and specialized services  including a full service gunsmith shop  a full service archery pro shop and archery target lanes 
some of the large format stores also include a bait shop that opens early for the convenience of our customers 
we utilize outside selling areas adjacent to most of our large format stores to display additional offerings of larger items such as atvs  boats  kayaks  trailers and canoes 
nearly all of our stores have a gander mountain lodge  which is an in store meeting room available for public use  where we provide hunter safety classes  outdoor skills seminars and other community focused activities 
on december  we acquired overton s  inc  a leading internet and catalog marketing company targeting recreational boaters and water sports enthusiasts 
overton s product line is extensive  ranging from water skis  wakeboards and apparel to electronics  boat covers  boat seats and other marine accessories 
overton s products are sold under two principal brands  overton s and consumers marine  through a multi channel approach that includes catalogs  websites www 
overtons 
com and www 
consumersmarine 
com and three retail showrooms 
overton s is a wholly owned subsidiary of gander mountain headquartered in greenville  north carolina 
we are utilizing several strategic and operating initiatives aimed at improving our merchandise offerings  enhancing profitability and expanding the number and geographic diversity of our stores 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as comparable store sales  sales per square foot  gross margin percentage and store operating expenses  with a focus on labor  as a percentage of sales 
we also measure and evaluate investments in our retail locations  including inventory and property and equipment 
inventory performance is primarily measured by inventory per square foot and by inventory turns  or the number of times store inventory turns over in a given period  and amounts of owned inventory at various times based on payment terms from our vendors 
the most significant investments in property and equipment are made at the time a store is opened by us 
we believe that the overall growth of our business will allow us to generally maintain or increase our product gross margins 
increased merchandise volumes should enable us to improve our purchasing leverage and achieve greater support throughout the supply chain 
the mix of merchandise in our total sales also influences our product gross margins 
as we continue sales and store growth  a number of other factors may impact  positively or negatively  our product gross margin percentage  including the introduction of new product categories with varying gross margin percentage characteristics  changes in the merchandise mix at our current locations  differences in merchandise mix by geographic location  price competition  clearance activities in connection with seasonal inventory management  closeout sales in connection with store relocations and consolidations  sourcing of products from locations outside the united states  vendor programs  and supply chain enhancements 
in addition  our gross margin is impacted by store occupancy and distribution costs 
we monitor these costs in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the most significant store operating expenses are labor and related employee benefits and advertising 
our employee benefits include health insurance  the cost of which continues to increase faster than the general rate of inflation 
we continually monitor this cost and review strategies to effectively control increases  but we are subject to the overall trend of increases in health care costs 
advertising costs are monitored as a percentage of sales 
these costs are largely variable  which allows us to actively manage them to facilitate achieving our sales  gross margin percentage and store operating contribution objectives 
store operating contribution  which is calculated by deducting a store s operating expenses from its gross margin  is used to evaluate overall performance on an individual store basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses are monitored and controlled as a percentage of sales 
we have made significant investments in infrastructure  including our information systems  distribution capabilities and personnel 
our current infrastructure facilitates our planned opening of stores 
we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales over time 
pre opening expenses will continue to be related to store openings  including relocations 
these expenses will fluctuate based on the number and timing of new store openings 
inventory turns are based on cost of sales and average inventory for the applicable period 
we recognize that our inventory turns may be lower than those of other retailers  which we believe is due  in part  to the categories of merchandise we carry  including firearms  and the large quantities of merchandise we use in our in store displays 
we believe we have the opportunity to enhance our supply chain to improve our inventory turns 
additionally  in merchandise categories that experience slower inventory turns  we continue to work with vendors to increase our trade credit terms to reduce our investment in owned inventory 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve our inventory turns or inventory investment 
identification of appropriate new store sites is essential to our growth strategy 
we believe our focus on our larger store size and our ability to utilize either recycled  or second use  facilities or build to suit locations provides us with increased opportunities to find optimal real estate locations on attractive terms 
we evaluate and invest in new stores based on site specific projected returns on investment 
since the acquisition of overton s  we now have two reportable segments retail and direct 
the retail segment sells its outdoor lifestyle products and services through its retail stores located in states 
the direct segment is the internet and catalog operations of overton s  offering primarily boating and watersports accessory products through numerous direct mail catalogs and its e commerce websites 
we evaluated our operating and reporting segments in accordance with sfas no 
and considered the discrete financial information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding allocation of resources and in assessing performance 
reporting in this format provides management with the financial information necessary to evaluate the success of the segments and the overall business 
prior to december   we operated under one segment  retail

pre opening expenses consist primarily of payroll  rent  recruiting  advertising and other costs incurred prior to a new store opening 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from sales of million from fiscal and fiscal new stores not included in the comparable store sales base  a comparable store sales decrease of million and an million sales decrease from stores closed during but open in as well as changes in other revenue 
overton s sales for two months in fiscal also contributed million of the increase 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  including three relocated stores  and added  square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
we also closed two underperforming stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we opened eight new stores  including one relocated store  and added  square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
our comparable store sales declined for fiscal  as compared to a comparable store sales decline of for fiscal for fiscal  the decline is calculated by comparing the weeks of fiscal to weeks  not the actual weeks  for fiscal the fiscal decline is due to weak sales in the second half of fiscal comparable store sales in our fiscal third quarter decreased and our fiscal fourth quarter decreased  eroding the comparable store sales increase in the first half of fiscal the sales decline was impacted by worsening overall economic conditions  including credit concerns  housing market foreclosures  rising fuel and food prices  and decreased consumer confidence 
we believe these conditions negatively impacted many specialty retailers especially in the fourth quarter 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we believe sales were negatively impacted by our decision to reduce advertising expenditures 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal with no product category changing its sales mix more than basis points  except the powersports category 
powersports continued to gain market share with a significant increase in comparable stores sales and increased sales penetration of basis points  driven largely by increased penetration of boat sales 
the apparel category experienced a decline in its share of the sales mix  driven by less clearance sales in fiscal and less traffic in our stores during our third and fourth quarter prime seasons 
the fishing category increased its penetration due partly to store expansion into the south and southeast where fishing participation is year round  while footwear increased penetration due to store merchandising changes and new products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the more significant factors affecting gross margin during fiscal year were an initial product margin increase of basis points as a result of continued benefits from increasing scale  the positive impact of our everyday low price strategy on our pricing structure  higher penetration of our owned brand merchandise  and lower clearance inventory coupled with better management of clearance merchandise and pricing  a basis point negative impact on initial margin from the change in our product mix  largely due to increased lower margin power sports sales and decreased higher margin apparel sales  and a basis point negative impact from increased store occupancy costs as a result of reduced leverage from lower comparable store sales and lower sales per square foot at our newer  less mature stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary factors in this increase were i labor costs in the retail stores that accounted for basis points of the increase  as labor costs could not be adjusted commensurate with the sales decline  ii increased depreciation at the retail store level that resulted in a basis points negative impact  and iii other selling  general and administrative costs which were negatively impacted basis points from de leverage due to weak sales 
overton s also added basis points in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal during a seasonally slow two month sales period for overton s 
exit costs  impairment and other charges 
during the latter half of fiscal  in response to changes in economic and retail industry conditions  management began efforts to streamline operating activities and took further actions designed to improve profitability 
this included closing two unprofitable stores  a reduction in the stores and markets that sold our powersports products and reductions in workforce at our headquarters location in st 
paul 
in addition  we recorded severance costs earlier in fiscal relative to two executive terminations 
also  as a result of the overton s acquisition in december  we wrote off certain assets  whose use was discontinued  related to capitalized web site development costs that began earlier in fiscal these charges in the aggregate were million for fiscal with million incurred in the fourth quarter 
for fiscal  these charges were  and represented exit costs for closed stores and severance costs only 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened new stores in fiscal and eight new stores in fiscal  including relocated stores in both periods 
pre opening expenses on a per store basis declined slightly in fiscal due to continued efficiencies in store opening processes and cost control 
gain on insurance settlement 
during our third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a gain of million in connection with an insurance settlement resulting from flood damage at one of our stores 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average outstanding borrowings used to fund our growth and operating loss 
average outstanding borrowings during fiscal increased  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to increased cash used to fund our growth and operating loss  for capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores and the overton s acquisition 
higher average borrowings were substantially offset by an approximately basis points decrease in average interest rates due to general interest rate declines and as a result of the february  amendment to our credit facility 
average interest rates on our outstanding borrowings were basis points lower in fiscal than in fiscal the average effective interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings as of february  and february  was and  respectively 
debt conversion charge 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of our common stock 
the purchase price was paid with million in cash and the tender of our outstanding million convertible note in exchange for  shares of common stock 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non cash charge of million in fiscal representing the fair value of the common shares issued in excess of the shares that were issuable under the original convertible note agreement executed in august income tax provision 
our fiscal tax provision primarily represents minimum or net worth taxes due in various states 
certain states have adopted an adjusted gross receipts tax 
we have no provision for federal income tax for fiscal or fiscal due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net loss 
our net loss was million for fiscal  as compared to net loss of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from sales of million from fiscal and fiscal new stores not included in the comparable store sales base  a comparable store sales increase of million and a million sales decrease from stores closed during but open during and changes in other revenue

during fiscal  we opened new stores  including two relocated stores  and added million square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
comparable store sales decreased for fiscal primarily from weak sales in our first half of fiscal comparable store sales in our fiscal third quarter increased and were approximately flat in our fiscal fourth quarter at 
our fiscal fourth quarter was negatively impacted by particularly warm weather in our northern states in december  which adversely affected apparel and footwear 
the slower first half of fiscal is primarily reflective of i reduced spending in advertising and promotions  ii our focus on our everyday low price strategy that resulted in fewer promotions to drive customer traffic  and iii lower levels of clearance merchandise available to customers 
cannibalization from some of the new store openings and new competition entering some of our markets continues to reduce our overall level of comparable store sales 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal with no product category changing its sales mix more than  except the firearms ammunition category 
our firearms ammunition category continues to gain market share with a significant increase in comparable stores sales and increased sales penetration of basis points 
the power sports category increased its sales penetration by basis points  driven largely by atv sales at new large format stores and increased penetration of boat sales in our second year with this category 
the apparel footwear category experienced a decline in its share of the sales mix  primarily driven by weather factors 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the more significant factors primarily affecting gross margin during fiscal year were an initial product margin increase of approximately basis points as a result of continued benefits from increasing scale  the positive impact of our everyday low price strategy on our pricing structure  higher penetration of our owned brand merchandise  and lower clearance inventory coupled with better management of clearance merchandise and pricing  an approximately basis point negative impact from the change in our product mix  an approximately basis point favorable impact from increased co branded credit card revenues  an approximately basis point favorable impact from improved leverage from distribution costs  an approximately basis point negative impact from increased store occupancy costs as a result of reduced leverage from lower comparable store sales and lower sales per square foot at our newer  less mature stores  an approximately basis point negative impact from reduced vendor discounts for new stores as a result of opening fewer new stores with lower inventories for those new stores  and an approximately basis point negative impact from the continuation in the trend toward higher freight in costs as fuel prices increased 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal advertising expense decreased basis points due to our decision to reduce advertising in the first half of the fiscal year and shift a portion of advertising expenditures from print media to local radio in the second half of the fiscal year 
exit costs  impairment and other charges 
exit costs  impairment and other charges decreased by million  or  to  in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred minimal charges for stores that were closed for relocation and a minimal amount for severance 
in fiscal  we incurred million in charges for stores that were closed for relocation  one with a significant remaining lease commitment and an additional million in severance costs  primarily at the executive and corporate level 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened eight new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal  including relocations 
pre opening expenses on a per store basis declined slightly due to continued efficiencies in store opening processes and cost control  with the exception of costs related to one significantly larger store 
gain on insurance settlement

debt conversion charge 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of our common stock 
the purchase price was paid with million in cash and the tender of our outstanding million convertible note in exchange for  shares of common stock 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non cash charge of million representing the fair value of the common shares issued in excess of the shares that were issuable under the original convertible note agreement executed in august income tax provision 
we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal or fiscal due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset was uncertain and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net loss 
our net loss was million for fiscal  as compared to net loss of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new store openings and related expenses  profitability of new stores  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuation  with the highest sales activity normally occurring during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  which are primarily associated with the fall hunting seasons and the holiday season 
in recent years  the second half of our fiscal years have generated approximately to of our annual sales  including new store sales 
in addition  our customers demand for our products and therefore our sales can be significantly impacted by unseasonable weather conditions that affect outdoor activities and the demand for related apparel and equipment 
our grand opening activities surrounding our new store openings can also cause fluctuations in sales when compared to operating periods in later months 
it is for this reason we include a new store in our comparable store sales base in its fifteenth full month to minimize the effect of grand opening activities 
this seasonality also impacts our inventory levels  which tend to rise beginning approximately in april  reach a peak in november  and decline to lower levels after the december holiday season 
the recently acquired overton s business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations  with its highest sales activity normally occurring during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year  which is the primary season for boating  marine and watersports related products 
historically  overton s has generated approximately to of its sales during the first half of our fiscal year and approximately during the second quarter of our fiscal year 
our pre opening expenses have and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  primarily due to the timing of store openings 
we typically incur most pre opening expenses for a new store during the three months preceding  and the month of  it s opening 
in addition  our labor and operating costs for a newly opened store can be greater during the first one to two months of operation than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new store openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs and store labor and operating expenses 
due to these factors  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year 
see note summary of quarterly results to our financial statements included in this report for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  property and equipment and pre opening expenses to support our new store growth plans and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses 
until the completion of our initial public offering  our main sources of liquidity were equity investments by  and advances from  holiday companies and its affiliated entities  and borrowings under our credit facility

pursuant to the agreements we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at per share for an aggregate purchase price of million 
gratco purchased  shares for a purchase price of million and holiday purchased  shares for a purchase price of million 
the net proceeds were used to partially fund the purchase price of overton s 
the shares were not registered under the securities act of upon issuance 
we offered and sold the shares to the purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by rule promulgated under regulation d 
we relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the purchasers in the stock purchase agreements 
we provided customary registration rights to the purchasers under the stock purchase agreements 
under the stock purchase agreements  we agreed to file a shelf registration statement on form s for resales of the shares within days of the closing date of december  we are further obligated to use our best efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to become effective under the securities act of within days after the closing date days in the event of a full review of the shelf registration statement by the securities and exchange commission 
each of gratco and holiday have confirmed to us their long term investment focus and represented to us in their respective stock purchase agreement that they are purchasing the shares for their own account and have no present intent to resell or distribute the shares 
the shares may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements 
unregistered sale of equity securities and conversion of convertible subordinated note on december   we agreed with the holder of our million floating rate convertible subordinated note due august  to amend and restate the note in order to i eliminate the right to convert the note into shares of our common stock and to ii eliminate the floating rate feature of the note and fix the interest rate at per year  a reduction of basis points 
the holder of the note was a trust  the annual income beneficiary of which is our chairman  david c 
pratt 
following the amendment of the note  the trust assigned the note to a newly formed limited liability company managed by mr 
pratt and comprised of certain pratt family trusts  the current beneficiaries of which are mr 
pratt or members of his immediate family 
on december   we entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares of common stock to the limited liability company for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
the per share price of the stock purchase was equal to the closing bid price per share of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on december  the purchase price for the shares was paid by surrendering the note for cancellation of the million in principal due thereunder and by delivering million in cash for the balance of the purchase price 
the net proceeds from the stock purchase  after deducting the expenses incurred to complete the deal  were approximately million  and were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the modifications to the note and subsequent tendering and cancellation of the note in a short time period were deemed to be an in substance conversion and  in effect  represented a modification to the conversion price 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash debt conversion charge in fiscal in the amount of million 
this charge was required because the note was tendered as consideration for equity shares and we issued additional shares beyond the number of shares issuable in the original note agreement 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that the resulting incremental million shares issued  valued at the fair value  be reflected as a debt conversion charge in our statement of operations 
the  shares were not registered under the securities act of upon issuance  but we are required to register these shares 
other financings during fiscal  we entered into agreements with two banks that allowed us to finance capital expenditures of certain of our new stores under long term  secured financing arrangements 
in june  in exchange for million  we issued a promissory note carrying a fixed interest rate of and a five year repayment term 
in september  in exchange for million  we issued a promissory note carrying a fixed interest rate of and a four year repayment term 
monthly payments of principal and interest are made under these notes  which are secured by certain property and equipment of new stores we opened in fiscal  and during july  we completed the purchase of an aircraft and financed million of the million purchase price with a term note 
the term note matures in seven years and has a fixed annual interest rate 
the note is collateralized by the aircraft 
we received million in proceeds from the sale of the aircraft we replaced 
during fiscal and fiscal  we purchased information technology equipment totaling million and million  respectively  financed through capital lease transactions 
these capital lease purchases are excluded from the caption purchases of property and equipment in our statements of cash flows for fiscal and fiscal  as they did not require the use of cash 
the deferred payments in connection with the aquisition of overton s require a  payment in each june and june the liability was discounted using a long term borrowing rate with an adjustment for risk premium 
income taxes net operating losses 
our tax provision in fiscal primarily represents minimum or net worth taxes due in various states 
certain states have recently adopted an adjusted gross receipts tax 
we have no provision for federal income tax for the three fiscal years ending february  due to accumulated operating losses 
due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss carry forwards  we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
in  we determined that a change in ownership  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  occurred effective february  this change in ownership imposes a limitation on the amount of our net operating losses that we may deduct for tax purposes in any given year 
we have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million expiring between and the amount of our net operating loss carry forwards subject to the section limitation was million at february  unrestricted net operating losses carry forwards were million 
we do not expect this limitation to materially impact our future tax provision for financial reporting purposes 
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the growth and success of our direct marketing business  the number of new stores we open  the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year and the need to fund operating losses 
these requirements will include costs directly related to opening new stores and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure  including technology and distribution capabilities  is able to support our store base and expected growth in our retail stores and internet and catalog business 
we opened  and new stores in each of fiscal years  and  respectively  including one to three relocated consolidated stores in each year 
our cash used in investing activities  for property and equipment purchases  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we currently plan to open five new stores in fiscal  including one relocation and the consolidation of two smaller format stores into one large format store and expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately to million  including capital expenditures to improve certain existing stores 
however  business conditions  business strategy or other factors may cause us to adjust these plans 
we believe that we will be able to service our business from our existing distribution facilities through fiscal we believe the timing of any expansion of our distribution capabilities will depend on the number of new stores we open  the growth of our internet and catalog business and the ability to finance an expansion 
the number of new stores we open will depend on the success of our business in fiscal and fiscal in december  we expended million to acquire overton s  a direct to consumer marketing company 
this acquisition enables us to leverage the value of our retail store distribution network and develop strategies to reach our customers through other channels catalog and internet based selling 
as overton s is a company with existing fulfillment and business capacity that is a close match with our seasonal needs  we do not anticipate our capital investment in the overton s business in fiscal to exceed million to million 
in  we began a significant effort to upgrade our merchandise and information systems that will provide enhanced efficiencies in buying  receiving  payables management and provide better and more detailed operating information for decision making and continued supply chain improvement 
we expect to continue to update our information systems over the next several years 
we intend to satisfy our capital requirements in fiscal with cash flows from operations  funds available under our credit facility and equipment financing leases 
however  if capital requirements for our business strategy change  or if sales and cash flows from operations do not meet anticipated levels  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets 
beyond fiscal  we anticipate needing additional financing to grow our business 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in borrowing additional funds at reasonable rates of interest or issuing equity at a favorable valuation  or at all 
interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
our floating rate indebtedness was million at february  and million at february  if short term floating interest rates on our average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding for each of the respective fiscal years 
we have not contracted for any derivative financial instruments 
we have no international sales  however  we import certain items for sale in our stores 
substantially all of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended february  we cannot assure you that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in future periods 
inflation in particular commodities  for example gasoline and food  that impact the general economic well being of consumers does impact consumer confidence and therefore may negatively impact our sales  depending on the severity of price increases and negative changes in economic conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments the following table contains information regarding our total contractual obligations  including off balance sheet arrangements  as of february  payments due by pay period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases     purchase obligations    capital lease obligations     long term debt      total      includes store operating leases  which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs  primarily common area costs and real estate taxes  in addition to rent 
these obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude direct operating costs 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery 
because these purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled  they are not included in this table of contractual obligations 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements 
these obligations include standby and documentary letters of credit outstanding in connection with the importing of merchandise  as well as for insurance purposes 
also includes other obligations for miscellaneous goods and services acquired  related primarily to marketing  advertising and information technology obligations

the payment obligation is reflected herein with interest to be paid 
this obligation will be reduced by allowable sales tax credits as defined in the related development agreement 
we can not estimate the amounts of these future credits  and accordingly  have not reduced payment obligations by any allowable credits 
these obligations also include capital leases for certain information technology equipment 
includes the million term loan b  various secured equipment notes payable and a deferred payment obligation in connection with the overton s acquisition

this statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after december   however  the guidance in this standard regarding the treatment of income tax contingencies is retrospective to business combinations completed prior to january  we adopt sfas r for any business combinations occurring at or subsequent to january  critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and readers should review those policies for additional information 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
inventory valuation we maintain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reduce inventory costs for estimates of vendor allowances  as described below 
valuation reserves are established based primarily on forecasted consumer demand  inventory aging and obsolescence 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or other changes impact demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we also establish inventory shrink reserves 
we estimate a provision for these losses based on independent  periodic physical inventory counts 
we accrue for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis  based on a number of factors  including historical results 
if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation is not in compliance with our policy 
vendor allowances we receive allowances in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to volume rebates  new store purchases  cooperative advertising allowances and other purchase discounts 
amounts to be received from a vendor are estimated on a monthly basis and are recognized as a reduction of costs of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on actual and estimated volumes of merchandise purchased from these vendors 
the majority of these vendor allowances are based on specific contract terms with our vendors 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future  undiscounted net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values and to determine the useful lives of the assets 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates regarding these factors  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
costs associated with exit activities the calculation of our location closing liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the timing and duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income 
when making these assumptions  we consider a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
financial accounting standards require that we estimate the potential value of sub lease income for store locations slated to be closed in our calculation of lease termination charges 
estimated sub lease income can be of material amounts 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to additional charges that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would require calculation of a location closing liability at this time  except as we have recorded and disclosed in our current financial statements 
insurance we retain a portion of the risk related to certain general liability  workers compensation  property loss and employee medical and dental claims 
liabilities associated with these losses are calculated for claims filed  and claims incurred but not yet reported  at our estimate of their ultimate cost  based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
our floating rate indebtedness was million at february  and million at february  if short term floating interest rates on the average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding for each of the respective fiscal years 
we have not contracted for any derivative financial instruments 
we have no international sales  however  we import certain items for sale in our stores 
substantially all of our purchases are denominated in us dollars
