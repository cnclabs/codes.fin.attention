yum s business consists of three reporting segments united states  the international division and the china division 
the china division includes mainland china  thailand and kfc taiwan and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations 
the china and international divisions have been experiencing dramatic growth and now represent over half of the company s operating profits 
the us business operates in a highly competitive marketplace resulting in slower profit growth  but continues to produce strong cash flows 
strategies the company continues to focus on four key strategies build leading brands in china in every significant category the company has developed the kfc and pizza hut brands into the leading quick service and casual dining restaurants  respectively  in mainland china 
additionally  the company owns and operates the distribution system for its restaurants in mainland china which we believe provides a significant competitive advantage 
given this strong competitive position  a rapidly growing economy and a population of billion in mainland china  the company is rapidly adding kfc and pizza hut casual dining restaurants and testing the additional restaurant concepts of pizza hut home service pizza delivery and east dawning chinese food 
our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual system sales growth of in mainland china driven by at least new restaurants each year  which we expect to drive annual operating profit growth of in the china division 
drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere the company and its franchisees opened over new restaurants in in the company s international division  representing straight years of opening over restaurants 
the international division generated million in operating profit in up from million in the company expects to continue to experience strong growth by building out existing markets and growing in new markets including india  france  russia  vietnam and africa 
our ongoing earnings growth model includes annual operating profit growth of driven by new restaurant openings annually for the international division 
new unit development is expected to contribute to system sales growth of at least to unit growth and to same store sales growth each year 
dramatically improve us brand positions  consistency and returns the company continues to focus on improving its us position through differentiated products and marketing and an improved customer experience

significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results the following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended december   december  and december  and could impact comparability with our results in mainland china commodity inflation china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales declined to during from in this decline was driven by rising chicken costs in mainland china  which make up approximately of mainland china s cost of food and paper  and higher restaurant labor costs in mainland china 
rising chicken costs are resulting from both lower than expected availability and increased demand in the market 
the increased costs were partially offset in by strong same store sales growth  including the impact of menu pricing increases 
in mainland china  we expect that high commodity inflation including higher chicken costs will continue into the first half of and moderate later in the year 
us restaurant profit our resulting us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points in and increased percentage points in our us restaurant profit was impacted in and by several key events and trends 
these include the negative impact on the taco bell business of adverse publicity related to a produce sourcing issue in the fourth quarter of and an infestation issue in one franchise store in february  fluctuations in commodity costs  and lower self insured property and casualty insurance reserves 
taco bell experienced significant sales declines at both company and franchise stores in the fourth quarter and for almost all of  particularly in the northeast us where both issues originated 
for the full year  taco bell s company same store sales were down 
taco bell s company same store sales were flat in the fourth quarter of and we believe that taco bell will fully recover from these issues 
however  our experience has been that recoveries of this type vary in duration 
in  we experienced significant increases in commodity costs resulting in approximately million of commodity inflation 
this inflation was primarily driven by meats and cheese products 
we expect these unfavorable commodity trends to continue in resulting in commodity inflation of approximately for the full year  with the majority of this impact seen in the first half of the year 
in  restaurant profits were positively impacted versus by a decline in commodity costs  principally meats and cheese  of approximately million 
the sizeable february beef recall in the us had no impact on our results though the impact  if any  on beef prices going forward is not yet known 
self insurance property and casualty insurance expenses were down million versus the prior year in both and  exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchising stores 
the favorability in insurance expenses was the result of improved loss trends  which we believe are primarily driven by safety and claims handling procedures we implemented over time  as well as workers compensation reforms at the state level 
we anticipate that given the significant favorability in  property and casualty expense in will be significantly higher in comparison 
the increased expenses are currently expected to be most impactful to our second quarter of pizza hut united kingdom acquisition on september   we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom uk unconsolidated affiliate from our partner  paying approximately million in cash  including transaction costs and net of million of cash assumed 
additionally  we assumed the full liability  as opposed to our fifty percent share  associated with the pizza hut uk s capital leases of million and short term borrowings of million 
this unconsolidated affiliate operated more than restaurants in the uk prior to the acquisition  we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
thus  we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate 
since the date of the acquisition  we have reported company sales and the associated restaurant costs  g a expense  interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income 
we no longer record franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate  nor do we report other income under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of this acquisition  company sales and restaurant profit increased million and million  respectively  franchise fees decreased million and g a expenses increased million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of this acquisition  company sales and restaurant profit increased million and million  respectively  franchise fees decreased million and g a expenses increased million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the impacts on operating profit and net income were not significant in either year 
extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a rd week every five or six years 
fiscal year included a rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period  as opposed to a monthly  basis 
in the us  we permanently accelerated the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december  and thus  there was no rd week benefit for this business 
additionally  all china division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a rd week 
the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease of the rd week on fiscal year revenues and operating profit us international division unallocated total revenues company sales franchise and license fees total revenues operating profit franchise and license fees restaurant profit general and administrative expenses equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates operating profit mainland china business issues our kfc business in mainland china was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late march as well as consumer concerns related to avian flu in the fourth quarter of as a result of the aforementioned issues  the china division experienced system sales growth in of  excluding foreign currency translation which was below our ongoing target of at least 
during the year ended december   the china division recovered from these issues and achieved growth rates of for both system sales and company sales  both excluding foreign currency translation 
during  we entered into agreements with the supplier of the aforementioned ingredient 
as a result  we recognized recoveries of approximately million in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  significant gains and charges in  we expect that our results of operations will be significantly impacted by several events  including the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan and refranchising gains and charges related to our us business 
in december  we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan for million in cash includes the impact of related foreign currency contracts that were settled in december 
our international subsidiary that owned this interest operates on a fiscal calendar with a period end that is approximately one month earlier than our consolidated period close 
thus  consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period  the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of approximately million will be recorded in the first quarter of we also anticipate pre tax gains from refranchising in the us of million to million in we expect  that together these gains will be partially offset by charges relating to g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources  as well as investments in our us brands to drive stronger growth 
the net impact of all of the aforementioned gains and charges is expected to generate approximately million in operating profit in while we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both kfcs and pizza huts in japan  it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate 
excluding the one time gain  we do not expect that the sale of our interest in our japan unconsolidated affiliate will have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in and beyond as the other income we recorded representing our share of earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate has historically not been significant million in 
future tax legislation mainland china on march   the national people s congress in mainland china enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on january  upon enactment  which occurred in the china division s second fiscal quarter  the deferred tax balances of all chinese entities  including our unconsolidated affiliates  were adjusted 
the impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended december  were not significant 
we currently estimate that these income tax rate changes will positively impact our net income between million and million compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted 
mexico value added tax vat exemption on october   mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to vat payments 
beginning on january   we will be required to remit vat on all company restaurant sales resulting in lower company sales and restaurant profit 
as a result of this new legislation  we estimate that our international division s company sales and restaurant profit will be unfavorably impacted by approximately million and million  respectively 
additionally  the international division s system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales will be negatively impacted by approximately and percentage points  respectively 
china reporting issues we have historically not consolidated an entity in china in which we have a majority ownership interest  instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting 
our partners in this entity are essentially state owned enterprises 
we have not consolidated this entity due to the historical effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business as addressed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights 
concurrent with a decision that we made on january  regarding top management of the entity  we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business 
accordingly  we will begin to consolidate this entity in the change will result in higher company sales  restaurant profit  g a expenses and income tax provision  as well as lower franchise and license fees and other income 
had this change occurred at the beginning of  our china division s company sales  restaurant profit and g a expenses would have increased approximately million  million and million  respectively  and our franchise and license fees and other income would have decreased million and million  respectively 
the net impact of these changes and the resulting minority interest would have resulted in operating profit increasing by million with an offsetting increase in income tax provision such that net income would not have been impacted 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets 
in the us  we are targeting company ownership of restaurants potentially below by year end  down from its current level of 
consistent with this strategy  company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in and in the international division  we expect to refranchise approximately pizza huts in the uk over the next several years reducing our pizza hut company ownership in that market from approximately currently to approximately 
refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
additionally  g a expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities 
the timing of such declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals 
g a expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct g a that we are no longer incurring as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year 
the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax in addition to our refranchising program  from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing  we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively store closures

our effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of tax reserves in connection with our regular us audit cycle as well as certain out of year adjustments to reserves and accruals that lowered our effective income tax rate by percentage points

thus  consistent with our historical treatment of events occurring during the lag period  the pre tax gain on the sale of this investment of approximately million will be recorded in the first quarter of however  the cash proceeds from this transaction were transferred from our international subsidiary to the us in december and are thus reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  the offset to this cash on our consolidated balance sheet at december  is in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million versus million in the increase was driven by the acquisitions of the remaining interest in our pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate and the rostik s brand and associated intellectual properties in russia 
the lapping of proceeds related to the sale of our fifty percent interest in our former poland czech republic unconsolidated affiliate also contributed to the increase 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from refranchising in net cash used in financing activities was million versus million in the increase was driven by higher share repurchases and higher dividend payments  partially offset by an increase in net borrowings 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million versus million in the decrease was driven by an increase in net borrowings and lower share repurchases  partially offset by a reduction in the excess tax benefits from share based compensation and higher dividend payments 
consolidated financial condition the increase in short term borrowings at december  was primarily due to the classification of million in senior unsecured notes as short term borrowings due to their may maturity date  partially offset by the repayment of two term loans in the international division during the year ended december  the increase in long term debt was primarily due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are due march  and million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes that are due november  liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last six fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we estimate that refranchising proceeds  prior to income taxes  will total at least million in our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized 
however  we believe our ability to reduce discretionary spending and our borrowing capacity would allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
discretionary spending during  we invested million in our businesses  including approximately million in the us  million for the international division and million for the china division 
for  we estimate capital spending will be between and million 
we returned approximately billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends in this is the third straight year that we returned over billion to our shareholders 
under the authority of our board of directors  we repurchased million shares of our common shares for billion during at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under an october authorization by our board of directors that allowed us to repurchase billion of the company s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through october subsequent to the company s year end  our board of directors authorized additional share repurchases of up to an additional billion of the company s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through january in october  the company announced that we plan to substantially increase the amount of share buybacks over the next two years  buying back a total of up to billion of the company s outstanding common stock  helping to reduce our diluted share count by as much as 
since the announcement of this plan  the company has repurchased million of our outstanding common stock through december  we expect this two year share repurchase program will be funded by a combination of the company s ongoing free cash flow  additional debt and refranchising proceeds 
the completion of this plan will depend on the company s cash flows  credit rating  proceeds from our refranchising efforts and availability of other investment opportunities  among other factors 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved cash dividends of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  for  we expect to return over billion to shareholders through both cash dividends and significant share repurchases 
we are now expecting a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately for and an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of of net income 
borrowing capacity on november   the company executed an amended and restated five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility totaling billion which replaced a five year facility in the amount of billion that was set to expire on september  the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens  and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit or banker s acceptances  where applicable 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or is determined by an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
on november   the company executed an amended and restated five year revolving credit facility the international credit facility or icf totaling million  which replaced a five year facility also in the amount of million that was set to expire on november  the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum and by yum s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the credit facility 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at the end of there were borrowings of million and available credit of million outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
in  we executed two short term borrowing arrangements the term loans on behalf of the international division 
there were borrowings of million outstanding at the end of under the term loans  both of which expired and were repaid in the first quarter of the majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  this amount includes million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due march  and million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due november   both of which were issued in october we are using the proceeds from these notes to repay outstanding borrowings on our credit facility  for additional share repurchases and for general corporate purposes 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates 
excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 
we have included in the contractual obligations table million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in cash in the next year 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
our most significant plan  the yum retirement plan the us plan  is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain full time us salaried employees 
our funding policy with respect to the us plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements  including requirements of the pension protection act of  plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the us plan s funded status 
the us plan s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of us plan assets 
based on current funding rules  we do not anticipate being required to make minimum pension funding payments in  but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the us plan s expected december  funded status 
during  we did not make a discretionary contribution to the us plan 
at our september  measurement date  our pension plans in the us  which include the us plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan  had a projected benefit obligation of million and plan assets of million 
the funding rules for our pension plans outside of the us vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates  performance of plan assets  local laws and tax regulations 
our most significant plans are in the uk  including a plan for which we assumed full liability upon our purchase of the remaining fifty percent interest in our former pizza hut uk unconsolidated affiliate 
since our plan assets approximate our projected benefit obligation for our kfc uk pension plan  we did not make a significant contribution in and we do not anticipate any significant further  near term funding 
the projected benefit obligation of our pizza hut uk pension plan exceeds plan assets by approximately million at our november  measurement date 
we anticipate taking steps to reduce this deficit in the near term  which could include a decision to partially or completely fund the deficit in however  given the level of cash flows from operations the company anticipates generating in  any funding decision would not materially impact our ability to maintain our planned levels of discretionary spending 
our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made postretirement benefit payments of million in see note for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured  including workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we had provided a partial guarantee of approximately million of a franchisee loan pool related primarily to the company s historical refranchising programs and  to a lesser extent  franchisee development of new restaurants at december  in support of this guarantee  we have provided a standby letter of credit of million  under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of the franchisee loan pool 
the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were approximately million at december  the loan pool is funded by the issuance of commercial paper by a conduit established for that purpose 
a disruption in the commercial paper markets may result in the company and the participating financial institutions having to fund commercial paper issuances that have matured 
any company funding under its guarantee or letter of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral 
we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities 
these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising gain loss 
new loans added to the loan pool in were not significant 
our unconsolidated affiliates do not have significant amounts of debt outstanding as of december  new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for further details of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
impairment evaluations for individual restaurants that we are currently operating and have not offered for sale are performed on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant 
our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant  which can be for a period of over years  and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted after tax cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate used is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and  therefore  perform such impairment evaluations at the group level 
these impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale 
forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds 
expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated using either discounted expected future cash flows from operations or the present value of the estimated future franchise royalty stream plus any estimated sales proceeds from refranchising 
any estimated sales proceeds are based on relevant historical sales multiples 
the discount rate used in determining fair value is our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium where deemed appropriate 
we have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions 
these include trademark brand intangible assets for kfc  ljs and a w 
we believe the value of a trademark brand is derived from the royalty we avoid  in the case of company stores  or receive  in the case of franchise stores  due to our ownership of the trademark brand 
we have determined that the kfc trademark brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized 
our impairment test for the kfc trademark brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
future sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the kfc trademark brand 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the kfc trademark brand  we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth  margin improvement and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans 
for  there was no impairment of goodwill or the kfc trademark brand 
we have certain intangible assets  such as the ljs and a w trademark brand intangible assets  franchise contract rights  reacquired franchise rights and favorable unfavorable operating leases  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
we base the expected useful lives of reacquired franchise rights over a period for which we believe it is reasonable that we will operate a company restaurant in the trade area 
we base the expected useful lives of our favorable unfavorable operating leases on the remaining lease term 
our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
allowances for franchise and license receivables lease guarantees we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 
such guarantees are subject to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
if payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with approximately million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had projected benefit obligations pbo of million and fair values of plan assets of million in december the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbo using a discount rate of at september  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement dates 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to decrease approximately million to million in the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss of million in a basis point change in our weighted average discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets at september  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our us pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our us plan assets have experienced  along with a decrease in discount rates over time  have largely contributed to an unrecognized net loss of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december  for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of this loss in net periodic benefit cost 
we will recognize approximately million of such loss in see note for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  under sfas no 
revised  share based compensation sfas r we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
we have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans 
historically  approximately of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 
grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by sfas r 
we revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
based on the results of this analysis  we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives 
upon each stock award grant we revaluate the expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income tax valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits at december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of million  as well as our other deferred tax assets  to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
effective december   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  the americas and europe 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  project  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
accordingly  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  changes in effective tax rates  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities  our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  unexpected disruptions in our supply chain  effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the company  the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing  advertising and promotional efforts  our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  the success of our refranchising strategy  the success of our strategies for international development and operations  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate  including effects of war and terrorist activities  new legislation and governmental regulations or changes in laws and regulations and the consequent impact on our business  new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors  changes in competition in the food industry  publicity which may impact our business and or industry  severe weather conditions  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the company and or our competitors  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates  and the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate
