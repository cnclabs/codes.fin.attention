the following discussion provides information with respect to our results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources on a comparative basis for the years ended june  and and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we operate a chain of pharmacies and provide pharmacy management services to various not for profit entities pharmacy

year ended june  compared to june  net revenues 
total revenues for the year ended june  increased  to  or from  for year ended june  increase pharmacy dispensing fees total total revenues increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the main reason was due to a increase in the number of prescriptions dispensed at stores open more than one year  the acquisition of a pharmacy in july  the addition of three new pharmacies in april and december  and february  respectively 
stores open more than one year experienced a growth in revenue 
the growth in the number of prescriptions dispensed did not correlate to a commensurate growth in revenue due to an increased number of generic medications as a percentage of total number of prescriptions dispensed 
generic medications typically have a lower selling price than brand name medications 
daw recognizes revenue both from the sale of prescription medications and other products as well as through dispensing fee revenue derived through the dispensing of prescriptions with inventory owned by fqhcs pursuant to pharmacy management services contracts entered into between daw and various fqhcs 
the pharmacy sales revenues other than dispensing fees increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to the acquired store  the opening of three new pharmacies  and a increase in sales at locations opened more than one year 
the increase in prescription dispensing at stores open more than one year can be attributed to greater drug utilization on the part of an aging population  an overall increase in market share within certain communities and an increased utilization of pharmacy services by patients of fqhcs with whom the pharmacies have contracts to provide services 
the pharmacies manage two pharmacies owned by fqhcs and additionally have contracts to provide pharmacy services to patients of five other fqhcs 
the pharmacies maintain a segregated inventory owned by the fqhcs for the purpose of dispensing prescriptions to health center patients 
dispensing fee revenue increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  two locations which opened in february and april  accounted for  of the increase 
the remainder of the increase can be attributed to an expanded number of and increased demand for covered medications effectuated during the fiscal year by the massachusetts health safety net office  an increased number of prescription benefit management contracts entered into by the fqhcs contracted with daw and marketing initiatives targeting the patients of the fqhcs 
gross profit margins 
pharmacy overall gross profit margins increased by 
to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  dispensing fee revenue is excluded from the calculation as there is no correlating inventory cost associated with the services provided 
the following is a table of gross profit margin percentages for the two years ended june increase the increase in gross profit margins was due to increased purchase volume discounts as well as increased dispensing of generic medications which carry higher gross profit margins 
each helped to offset lower insurance reimbursements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a for the year ended june  increased  to  or from  for year ended june  the following table shows the breakdown for the two years ended june increase s  g a at the pharmacies increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the pharmacies increase was primarily due to increased payroll costs of approximately  increased labor costs consisted of the following  of the increase occurred at stores open more than one year and is predominately the result of market pressures on salary and benefit packages for pharmacists 
the balance of the increase is attributable to the pharmacy acquired in july  as well as the four pharmacies opened between february  and february  the additional pharmacies also added approximately  in additional overhead 
the increase in non labor costs was due primarily to increases in rent expense  lifo increase due to rising prices and equipment rental and  to a lesser degree  by increased legal expense related to the acquisition of the remaining of daw and other operating costs 
corporate overhead increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  due to a combination of the following increased officer salaries of  principally due to a  charge attributable to the non renewal of the former chief executive officer s employment contract and  for the addition of the new chief executive officer s salary  increased legal expenses of  principally due to the purchase of the minority interest in daw  increased investment banker fees of  due to fees incurred for finding a source to buy the remaining of daw  increased stock option expense of  due to the election of two directors  an officer and the issuance of stock options to the management team of daw in connection with their three year renewal of employment agreements  increased annual meeting expenses of  due to additional matters voted upon  increased accounting expense of  due to additional fees for the review of sec filings  and increased extension fees of  paid to the minority shareholders prior to the february transaction described below

deemed dividend on redemption of preferred stock 
in february  we redeemed the then outstanding series a and b preferred stock series a and b preferred stock for  the excess over the carrying value of was recorded as a deemed dividend and increased the net loss applicable to common shareholders 
earnings per share 
basic loss earnings per share is computed by dividing loss earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share considers the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that shared in the loss earnings of the entity 
the dilutive effect of the series stock shall be reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the if converted method in accordance with sfas no 
for the twelve months ended june   due to their anti dilutive effect   common shares of stock options   common shares underlying convertible notes and  common shares underlying convertible preferred stock were excluded from the computation of dilutive loss earnings per share 
fasb emerging issue task force topic d  the effect on the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption or induced conversion of preferred stock  provides among other things  that any excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to the holders of preferred stock redeemed over the carrying amount of preferred stock  should be subtracted from net earnings to determine net loss income available to common shareholders in the calculation of earnings per share 
for the year ended june   this resulted in  being subtracted from net earnings

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory shrinkage  impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
for all pharmacy sales other than third party pharmacy sales and those described below  we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise at the time of the sale 
for third party pharmacy sales  revenue is recognized at the time the prescription is dispensed 
we record third party revenues and related receivables  net of provisions for contractual and other adjustments 
we also recognize revenues sales from non cash transactions wherein the pharmacy dispenses pharmaceuticals from its inventory provided to non profit organizations through certain governmental programs treating needy patients 
we receive a dispensing fee  a percentage of the costs of the medication and the replacement of the pharmaceuticals 
the dispensing fee and the percentage of the prescription cost are recorded as sales 
replacement of the pharmaceuticals received are recorded at cost 
we recognize dispensing fee revenue when it dispenses prescriptions for non profit agencies on a per prescription basis and receives a dispensing fee for each prescription dispensed 
in one contract  we also receive a stipulated monthly amount per patient 
our estimate of uncollectible amounts are based on our historical collection experience and current economic and credit conditions 
inventories 
included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrinkage  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we considered historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates upon which our reserves were based  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment 
we evaluate long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment in the fourth quarter and annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by estimating the expected future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and comparing this amount to the carrying value 
goodwill impairment 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our tests during the fourth quarter of fiscal years and resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our companies 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes 
we have significant deferred tax assets 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability considering our historical profitability  projected taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
we will establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments
