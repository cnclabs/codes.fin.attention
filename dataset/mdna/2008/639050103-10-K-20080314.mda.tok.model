item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained in this report 
third party reimbursement in the us  health care providers generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid  and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures they perform 
third party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement these payors provide for services 
in general  reimbursement for newborn screening is included in the lump sum payment for the newborn s birth and hospitalization 
for this reason  we are not able to measure a reimbursement success rate for our screening products 

table of contents customer service and support we provide a one year warranty on all medical device products 
we also sell extended service agreements on our medical device products 
service  repair  and calibration services for our domestic customers is provided by company owned service centers and our employee field service specialists 
service for our international customers is provided by a combination of our company owned authorized service centers and third party vendors on a contract basis 
manufacturing other companies manufacture a significant portion of the components used in our products  however  we perform final assembly  testing  and packaging of most of the devices ourselves to control quality and manufacturing efficiency 
we also use contract vendors to manufacture some of our disposable supply and medical device products 
we perform regular quality audits of these vendors 
we purchase materials and components from qualified suppliers that are subject to our quality specifications and inspections 
we conduct quality audits of our key suppliers  several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices  or supplies for use with medical devices 
most of our purchased components are available from more than one supplier 
our manufacturing  service  and repair facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state  and foreign regulatory authorities 
our quality assurance system is subject to regulation by the fda and other state government agencies 
we are required to conduct our product design  testing  manufacturing  and control activities in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations and to maintain our documentation of these activities in a prescribed manner 
in addition  our production facilities have received iso certification 
iso certification standards for quality operations have been developed to ensure that medical device companies meet the standards of quality on a worldwide basis 
we have also received the ec certificate pursuant to the european union medical device directive eec  which allowed us to place a ce mark on our products after assembling appropriate documentation 
research and development we are committed to introducing new products and supporting current product offerings in our markets through a combination of internal as well as external efforts that are consistent with our corporate strategy 
internal product development capabilities 
we believe that product development capabilities are essential to provide our customers with new product offerings 
we plan to leverage our core technologies by introducing product line extensions as well as new product offerings 
partnerships that complement our expertise 
we continue to seek strategic partners in order to develop products that may not otherwise be available to us 
by taking advantage of our core competencies  we believe that we can bring products to market in an efficient manner  and leverage our distribution channels 
new opportunities through technology acquisition 
we continue to evaluate new  emerging  and complementary technologies in order to identify new product opportunities 
with our knowledge of our current markets we believe that we can effectively develop technologies into successful new products 
our research and development expenses were million or of total revenue in  million or of total revenue in and million or of total revenue in proprietary rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and 
table of contents products we develop 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  and corporate partners  and seek to control access to our intellectual property  distribution channels  documentation  and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
the intellectual rights to some of the original patents for technology incorporated into our products are now in the public domain 
however  we do not consider these patents  or any currently viable patent or related group of patents to be of such importance that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business 
we capitalize the cost of purchased technology and intellectual property  as well as certain costs incurred in obtaining patent rights  and amortize these costs over the estimated economic lives of the related assets 
competition we sell our products in competitive and rapidly evolving markets 
we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small  privately held companies to multinational corporations and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our medical devices 
in the us  we sell our supply products in a mature market 
because these products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening supply products  could face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 
we believe the principal factors that will draw clinicians and other buyers to our products  include level of specificity  sensitivity  and reliability of the product  time required to obtain results with the product  such as to test for or treat a clinical condition  relative ease of use of the product  depth and breadth of the products features  quality of customer support for the product  frequency of product updates  extent of third party reimbursement of the cost of the product or procedure  extent to which the products conform to standard of care guidelines  and price of the product 
we believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the functionality and reliability of our products 
different competitors may have competitive advantages in one or more of the categories listed above and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products 
government regulation fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  the medical devices we sell  with the exception of some disposable products in our newborn care products  must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations under the food  drug  and cosmetics act  as amended clearance via section k  or 
table of contents premarket approval via section if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval via section is much more costly  lengthy  and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take longer 
we cannot be sure that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
the fda decides whether a device must undergo either the k clearance or premarket approval process based upon statutory criteria 
these criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives to be associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is substantially equivalent to devices that are already legally marketed 
the fda places devices deemed to pose relatively less risk in either class i or class ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting k clearance  unless an exemption applies 
the premarket notification under section k must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a previously cleared k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may  for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications 
the fda places devices deemed to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate device  in its class iii classification 
the fda requires these devices to undergo the premarket approval process via section in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device 
a premarket approval application must provide extensive pre clinical and clinical trial data 
the fda may require results of clinical trials in support of a k submission and generally requires clinical trial results for a premarket approval application 
in order to conduct a clinical trial on a significant risk device  the fda requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain  in advance  an investigational device exemption 
the investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results 
if the fda and the institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites approve the investigational device exemption application for a significant risk device  the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial 
an investigational device exemption approval provides for a specified clinical protocol  including the number of patients and study sites 
if the manufacturer deems the product a non significant risk device  the product will be eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements 
if the institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites concur with the non significant risk determination  the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial 
we received approval for our olympic cool cap product as a class iii device from the fda through the premarket approval process 
most of our other products in our newborn hearing screening  diagnostic hearing  eeg monitoring  polysomnography  and newborn care product lines have been approved by the fda as class ii devices 
some of our disposable products and newborn care products  such as our neonatal headshields and oxygen delivery systems  have received fda approval as class i devices 
fda regulation numerous fda regulatory requirements apply to our marketed devices 
these requirements include fda quality system regulations which require manufacturers to create  implement  and follow design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures  medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda certain types of adverse and other events involving their products  and fda general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses 

table of contents class ii and class iii devices may also be subject to special controls applied to them  such as performance standards  post market surveillance  patient registries  and fda guidelines that may not apply to class i devices 
we believe we are in compliance with the applicable fda guidelines  but we could be required to change our compliance activities or be subject to other special controls if the fda changes its existing regulations or adopts new requirements 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to adequately comply  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for k clearance or pre market approval of new products  withdrawal of k clearance or pre market approval already granted  or criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to require us to repair  replace  or refund the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
other us regulations we also must comply with numerous additional federal  state  and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  biohazards  fire hazard control  and hazardous substance disposal 
we believe we are currently in compliance with applicable safety  quality  environmental protection  biohazard  and hazardous substance disposal regulations 
foreign regulation in the foreign countries in which we sell or plan to sell our fda regulated products  these products are also regulated as medical devices  and are subject to regulatory requirements by foreign governmental agencies similar to those of the fda 
our manufacturing facilities are audited and have been certified to be isol en compliant  which allows us to sell our products in europe 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to ce mark and iso inspection by t v rheinland 
we plan to seek approval to sell our products in additional countries 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from fda requirements 
employees on december   we had approximately full time employees worldwide 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors we have completed a number of acquisitions and expect to complete additional acquisitions in the future 
there are numerous risks associated with acquisitions and we may not achieve the expected benefit of any of our acquisitions our acquisitions of products  technology assets  or businesses may have a negative impact on our business if we fail to achieve the anticipated financial  strategic  and other benefits of acquisitions or investments  and our operating results may suffer because of this 
we acquired intellectual property assets and technology patents from pemstar pacific consultants during  we acquired the assets of neometrics inc and affiliated entities during  and we acquired fischer zoth in we completed the acquisitions of bio logic  deltamed and olympic medical  and of certain assets from nascor in in november we completed the acquisition of xltek 
we expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses in future periods 
the acquisitions that we have completed may not result in improved operating results for us  or in our achieving a financial condition superior to that which we would have achieved had we not completed them 
our results of operations may be adversely impacted by costs associated with our acquisitions  including one time charges associated with restructurings or in process research and development assets 
our acquisitions could fail to produce the benefits that we anticipate  or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
in addition  some of the assumptions that we have relied upon  such as achievement of operating synergies  may not be realized 
in this event  one or more of the acquisitions could result in reduced earnings of natus as compared to the earnings that would have been achieved by natus if the acquisition had not occurred 
if we fail to successfully manage the combined operations of natus and the businesses we have acquired  we may not realize the potential benefits of the acquisition 
our corporate headquarters are located in san carlos  
table of contents california 
bio logic s primary offices are located in illinois  olympic medical s operations are in washington  xltek s operations are located in ontario  canada  neometrics operations are located in new york  deltamed s operations are in france  and fischer zoth s operations are in germany 
the geographical distance between our various facilities may further adversely affect our ability to manage these operations 
if we fail to manage these disparate operations effectively  our results of operations could be harmed  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave  and customers could cancel existing orders or choose not to place new ones 
in addition  we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits of the acquisition that we anticipate 
we may encounter the following additional difficulties  costs  and delays involved in integrating and managing these operations  and the operations of companies we may acquire failure of customers to continue using the products and services of the combined company  failure to successfully develop the acquired technology into the desired products or enhancements  assumption of unknown liabilities  failure to understand and compete effectively in markets and with products or technologies with which we have limited previous experience  impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  generated as a result of the acquisition  decreased liquidity  restrictive bank covenants  and incremental financing costs associated with debt we may incur to complete future acquisitions  and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 
indicative of the types of risks associated with our acquisitions  on october  we received a warning letter from the united states food and drug administration the fda related to the operations of our olympic medical manufacturing facility in seattle  washington 
the letter focused on process deficiencies that were identified during an fda inspection in april in november we instituted a voluntary suspension of operations at the olympic medical facility in order to better enable us to continue to address the findings identified by the fda in its warning letter 
we responded to the fda s warning letter in late november 
we have not had further communication from the fda since we responded to their warning letter 
however  we do not know what the ultimate outcome of the fda s action will be or that our business will not be adversely affected by these or similar actions 
a more comprehensive discussion of the risks associated with fda oversight of our business and our regulatory environment is contained in this item a  risk factors 
in november we completed the acquisition of xltek for cash and used substantially all of our available cash and entered into a credit facility to fund the acquisition we used virtually all of our existing cash resources to complete the acquisition of xltek  and also incurred indebtedness under a new bank facility for a portion of the purchase price 
this usage of cash had an adverse impact on our liquidity and forces us to place more reliance on cash flow from operations for our liquidity 
if our cash flow from operations is not sufficient for our needs  our business could be adversely affected 
if we are required to seek additional external financing to support our need for cash  we may not have access to financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
alternatively  we may feel compelled to access additional financing on terms that are dilutive to existing holders of our common stock or that include covenants that restrict our business  or both 
the senior secured borrowing facility that we established to obtain a portion of the funds needed to complete the acquisition of xltek contains various covenants that directly or indirectly restrict our ability to engage in activities that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interest of the company 
the loan is secured by the assets of the company  and this security interest may also negatively impact our flexibility to engage in financing or other activities in future periods 

table of contents our growth in recent years has depended substantially on the completion of acquisitions and we may not be able to complete acquisitions of this nature or of a relative size in the future to support a similar level of growth the acquisitions that we have completed have been the primary source of our growth in revenue over the last four years 
we expend considerable effort in seeking to identify attractive acquisition candidates and  upon doing so  to convince the potential target to consider a sale to us and  ultimately  to negotiate mutually agreeable acquisition terms 
if we are not successful in these efforts in the future  our growth rate will not increase at a rate corresponding to that which we have achieved in recent years 
further  as we grow larger it will be necessary to complete the acquisition of larger companies and product lines to support a growth similar to that which we have achieved in the past 
the market for attractive acquisitions is competitive and others with greater financial resources than we have may be better positioned than we are to acquire desirable targets 
further  we may not be able to negotiate acquisition terms with target companies that will allow us to achieve positive financial returns from the transaction 
following our acquisitions we have implemented integration and restructuring activities that could be disruptive to our operations  and we could fail to achieve the synergies and cost savings the activities are designed to produce following our acquisition of xltek we initiated an integration plan that resulted in a reduction in force and realignment of our domestic sales force 
in addition  in february  we adopted an integration and restructuring plan that is designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisitions and to improve efficiencies in operations 
this plan will be implemented over the first three quarters of the realignment of our domestic sales organization could be disruptive to our sales efforts while this new structure is implemented  and once implemented may not be effective 
in addition  our integration and restructuring activities may not result in the acquisition synergies or cost savings these activities are designed to produce and could  among other things  impair new products development and our support of existing products 
future changes in technology or market conditions could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets  including goodwill  resulting in additional charges that could significantly impact our operating results at december   we had significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets might be hindered by events over which we have no control 
due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions that adversely affect the competitiveness of our products 
any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their fair value could result in substantial impairment charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
our acquisitions have included in process research and development assets ipr d assets for which we hope to generate future cash flows  our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to bring these assets to market through our acquisitions of other businesses  we have acquired ipr d assets from which we hope to generate future cash flows 
there is inherent risk in bringing these ipr d assets to market and we may be unable to realize the full value we have assigned to them 
we may be unable to complete the development of these ipr d assets within a timely manner  or we may encounter technological difficulties that prevent us from completing their development 
if we are unable to derive future revenue from our ipr d assets  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

table of contents we may not be able to preserve the value of our intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to it or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ  other medical device companies could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management s attention and resources 
failing to enforce our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of those rights 
if health care providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our devices or supplies  or if reimbursement policies change adversely  we may not be successful marketing and selling products or technologies clinicians  hospitals  and government agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if clinicians are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our devices or supplies 
unless a sufficient amount of conclusive  peer reviewed clinical data about our products has been published  third party payors  including insurance companies and government agencies  may refuse to provide reimbursement 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is provided  it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals 
some third party payors may impose restrictions on the procedures for which they will provide reimbursement 
if health care providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for our products or the screenings conducted with our products  we may not achieve significant market acceptance of our products 
acceptance of our products in international markets will depend upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement  funding  and health care payment systems vary significantly by country 
we may not obtain approvals for reimbursement in a timely manner or at all 
adverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business 
we are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors  particularly those in countries and regions outside the us for example  some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
in a managed care system the cost of our products may not be incorporated into the overall payment for patient care or there may not be adequate reimbursement for our products separate from reimbursement for other procedures 
if we fail in our efforts to educate clinicians  government agency personnel  and third party payors on the effectiveness of our products  we will not achieve future sales growth it is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians  hospital administrators  and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use 
the commercial success of our products depends upon clinician  government agency and other third party payor confidence in the economic and clinical benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the efficacy  reliability  sensitivity and specificity of our products 
we believe that clinicians will not use our products unless they determine  based on published peer reviewed journal articles and experience  that our products provide an accurate and cost effective alternative to other means of testing or treatment 
our customers may choose to use competitive products  which may be less expensive or may provide faster results than our devices 
clinicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products  testing practices and clinical treatments  partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
if clinicians  government agencies and hospital administrators do not adopt our products  we may not maintain profitability 
factors that may adversely affect the medical community s acceptance of our products include publication of clinical study results that demonstrate a lack of efficacy or cost effectiveness of our products  
table of contents changing governmental and physician group guidelines  actual or perceived performance  quality  price  and total cost of ownership deficiencies of our products relative to other competitive products  our ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physicians  physician organizations  hospitals  state laboratory personnel  and third party payors  changes in state and third party payor reimbursement policies for our products  and repeal of laws requiring universal newborn hearing screening and metabolic screening 
increased sales through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which would reduce our revenue and gross profits we have entered  and expect in the future to enter into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts from our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenue and profits to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of gpos  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to gpo members  the gpo members receive volume discounts from our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us 
sales to members of all gpos accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue during  and  respectively  and sales to members of one gpo  novation llc  accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
other of our existing customers may be members of gpos with which we do not have agreements 
our sales efforts through gpos may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new gpos and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those gpos  our revenue and profits could decline 
demand for some of our products depends on the capital spending policies of our customers  and changes in these policies could harm our business a majority of customers for our products are hospitals  physician offices  and clinics 
many factors  including public policy spending provisions  available resources  and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities and therefore the amount that they can spend on our equipment products 
if budget resources limit the capital spending of our customers  they will be unlikely to either purchase any new equipment from us or upgrade to any of our newer equipment products 
these factors can have a significant adverse effect on the demand for our products 
our markets are very competitive and in the united states we sell certain of our products in a mature market we face competition from other companies in all of our product lines 
our competitors range from small  privately held companies to multinational corporations and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth 
we do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines 
the markets for certain of our products in the us  including the newborn hearing screening and eeg monitoring markets  are mature and we are unlikely to see significant growth for such products in the us in the us we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our hearing screening devices 
because these disposable supply products can generate high margins  we expect that our products  particularly our hearing screening disposable supply products  could face increasing competition  including competitors offering lower prices  which could have an adverse affect on our revenue and margins 
we believe that our primary competitive strengths relate to the functionality and reliability of our products  our recognized brands  and our developed sales channels 
our competitors may have certain competitive 
table of contents advantages  which include the ability to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products 
consequently  we may need to increase our efforts  and related expenses for research and development  marketing  and selling to maintain or improve our position 
we expect recurring sales to our existing customers to generate a majority of our revenue in the future  and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us  our revenue may decline 
our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional products or improving our existing products we intend to develop additional products and technologies  including enhancements of existing products  for the screening  detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical ailments 
developing new products  and improving our existing products  to meet the needs of current and future customers requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to successfully sell new products  update our existing products  or timely react to changes in technology  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 
our plan to expand our international operations will result in increased costs and is subject to numerous risks  if our efforts are not successful  this could harm our business we have expanded our international operations through acquisitions and plan to expand our international sales and marketing efforts to increase sales of our products in foreign countries 
we may not realize corresponding growth in revenue from growth in international unit sales  due to the lower average selling prices we receive on sales outside of the us even if we are able to successfully expand our international selling efforts  we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the us our international operations are subject to other risks  which include impact of possible recessions in economies outside the us  political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the us and abroad  contractual provisions governed by foreign law  such as local law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors  decreased health care spending by foreign governments that would reduce international demand for our products  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that could make our products less competitive because most of our international sales are denominated in the us dollar  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions  difficulty in obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approval  and attitudes by clinicians  and cost reimbursement policies  towards use of disposable supplies that are potentially unfavorable to our business 
if guidelines mandating universal newborn hearing screening do not continue to develop in foreign countries and governments do not mandate testing of all newborns as we anticipate  or if those guidelines have a long phase in period  our revenue may be adversely impacted we estimate that approximately of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing impairment prior to discharge from the hospital 
to date  there has been only limited adoption of newborn 
table of contents hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments  and the phase in period generally spans several years 
the widespread adoption of guidelines depends  in part  on our ability to educate foreign government agencies  neonatologists  pediatricians  third party payors  and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn hearing screening as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring 
our revenue from our newborn hearing screening product lines may not grow if foreign governments do not require universal newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge  if physicians or hospitals are slow to comply with those guidelines  or if governments provide for a lengthy phase in period for compliance 
because we rely on distributors or sub distributors to sell our products in most of our markets outside of the us  our revenue could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us  or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated we currently rely on our distributors or sub distributors for a majority of our sales outside the us our reliance on international distributors has increased because of our decisions in and to close our japanese and uk sales subsidiaries and sell through distributors in those countries  and because of our acquisition of fischer zoth  which sells its products through distributors in europe and asia 
we may also sell deltamed products through distributors in countries outside of france and germany 
some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of clinicians and government agencies 
we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in europe  japan  and other developed countries 
if we fail to sell our products through our international distributors  we would experience a decline in revenues unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors to market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors  the rate of growth of our revenue could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products 
none of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products 
we may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our international distributors 
these laws may require us to make payments to our distributors if we terminate our relationship for any reason  including for cause 
some countries require termination payments under local law or legislation that may supersede our contractual relationship with the distributor 
any required payments would adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may suffer because of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and may require us to engage in foreign currency hedging substantially all of our sales contracts with our us based customers provide for payment in us dollars 
in addition  sales to most of our international distributors provide for payment in us dollars 
however  substantially all of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
to date we have not undertaken any significant foreign currency transactions to hedge these currency risks and  as a result  our future revenue and expenses may be subject to volatility due to exchange rate fluctuations that could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
if we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities  our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products 
some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
we have relatively few sources of supply for some of the components used in our products and in some cases we rely entirely on sole source suppliers 
in addition  the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
for example  during  we relied on a single supplier of cables used in our algo hearing screening devices to help us complete a field replacement program of those cables 
if our suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with components meeting our requirements  it might be 
table of contents difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner  or at all 
this would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenue and operating results to suffer 
replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional employees  we cannot grow or maintain profitability our products and technologies are complex  and we depend substantially on the continued service of our senior management team 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development process 
our future success also will depend  in part  on the continued service of our key management personnel  software engineers  and other research and development employees and our ability to identify  hire  and retain additional personnel  including customer service  marketing  and sales staff 
hiring research and development  engineering  sales  marketing and customer service personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our product technologies 
we may be unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
our ability to market and sell products depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations 
our failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and compliance could negatively affect our business our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by similar regulatory agencies in many other countries in which we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we propose to market in the us must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations clearance via section k of the food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended  or premarket approval via section of the food  drug  and cosmetics act if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s section k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval via section is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
the fda may not grant either section k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
the fda may impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
domestic regulation of our products and manufacturing operations  other than that which is administered by the fda  includes the environmental protection act  the occupational safety and health act  and state and local counterparts to these acts 
our business would be harmed if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations or we do not pass an inspection we are subject to market surveillance by the fda concerning compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  
table of contents recall or seizure of our products  issuance of public notices or warnings  imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of production  refusal of our requests for section k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawal of section k clearance or premarket approvals already granted  or criminal prosecution 
our facilities are subject to inspection by the fda 
upon completing these inspections  the fda may take a variety of actions  including issuing observations on form fda or issuing a warning letter 
the issuance of a warning letter by the fda could result in regulatory action being initiated by the fda without further notice  and these actions could include seizure  injunction  and or civil money penalties 
in the past  we have cooperated fully with the fda in their inspections and have responded to their observations on form in the ordinary course of business  and to the warning letter received in october to date  these inspections and observations have not resulted in a significant adverse impact on the operations of the company  however  they could have a significant adverse impact in the future 
we have received clearance from the fda to market a new product that will potentially expose us to greater products liability exposure and fda regulation in december we received clearance from the fda to market the olympic cool cap  a product designed to lower the cerebral temperature of newborns born with a particular medical condition 
this product is a class iii minimally invasive medical device  and as such we may be subject to an increased product liability risk relative to our other class i and class ii non invasive products 
in addition  this type of product is subject to greater fda oversight than our other products and there is greater risk that sales of the product could be interrupted due to the premarket approval processes of the fda and other regulatory bodies 
our business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials  or the fda takes an enforcement action against us for off label uses we are prohibited by the fda from promoting or advertising our medical device products for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals  or from making unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products 
if the fda determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances  or are unsupported  it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us 
if we were subject to such an action by the fda  our sales could be delayed  our revenue could decline  and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed 
if we  or our suppliers  fail to comply with applicable regulations  sales of our products could be delayed and our revenue could be harmed every manufacturer of a finished medical device  including natus and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers  is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation and comparable regulations of states and other countries 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through periodic inspections 
for example in october we received a warning letter from the fda that focused on process deficiencies at our olympic facility in seattle  washington 
as a result  we initiated a voluntary plant shutdown of the olympic facility for the month of november after reviewing processes at the facility  we responded to the fda s warning letter in late november to date  the fda has not further communicated with us concerning this matter  but they could decide that we undertook insufficient remedial actions  which could have an adverse impact on the operations of the company 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to take adequate corrective action in a timely fashion in response to a quality system regulation inspection  the fda could shut down our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations or require us  among other things  to recall our products  either of which would harm our business 

table of contents our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim the medical technology industry has  in the past  been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights 
we expect that medical screening and diagnostic products may become increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
third parties such as individuals  educational institutions or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could have any of the following negative consequences result in costly litigation and damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or suspensions  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of infringement against us could result in a substantial damage award and materially harm our financial condition 
our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  or design and build non infringing products  could prevent us from selling our products and adversely affect our business and financial results 
we license intellectual property rights from third parties and would be adversely affected if our licensors do not appropriately defend their proprietary rights or if we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others we license rights from third parties for products and technology that are important to our business 
if our licensors are unsuccessful in asserting and defending their proprietary rights  including patent rights and trade secrets  we may lose the competitive advantages we have through selling products that we license from third parties 
additionally  if it is found that our licensors infringe on the proprietary rights of others  we may be prohibited from marketing our existing products that incorporate those proprietary rights 
under our licenses  we are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  or otherwise breach a license agreement  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages  and an increase in our insurance rates the sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of a product liability claim by someone claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business reputation or financial condition 
our product liability insurance may not protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 
we have experienced seasonality in the sale of our products we experience seasonality in our revenue 
for example  our sales typically decline from our fourth fiscal quarter to our first fiscal quarter  due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers  many of which are government agencies 
we may also experience declining sales in the third fiscal quarter due to summer holiday and vacation schedules 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience these seasonal fluctuations  which may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results

our revenue is generated almost exclusively from sales of devices and systems  which are generally non recurring  and related supplies and services  which are generally recurring 
we sell our products in the united states primarily through a direct sales organization and also sell certain products through distributors and under private label agreements 
we sell our products outside the us primarily through a distributor sales channel  which consists of distributors selling natus products into more than countries  however  we sell some of our products in france and germany through a direct sales organization 
we previously had direct sales organizations in japan and the united kingdom uk 
in we ceased selling through a direct sales force in japan and began to sell through a distributor  and in february we ceased selling through a direct sales force in the uk and began to sell through a distributor 
we intend to continue expansion of our international operations because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
international sales made to distributors are characterized by lower gross profits due to the discount from our list prices that the distributors receive 
international sales contributed to of our revenue during  compared to of our revenue during the increase in international sales as a percent of total sales in compared to was attributable to our acquisition of olympic and strong sales from fischer zoth 
we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percent of revenue in the future 
we estimate that approximately of the children born in the us are currently being tested for hearing impairment prior to discharge from the hospital 
as such  the us market is mature and competitive 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our screening devices 
because these products can generate high margins  we may face increasing competition 
we believe that our primary competitive advantage relates to the functionality and reliability of our products and that other suppliers may compete against us by offering lower prices 
our net income or loss can be markedly impacted by our decisions regarding the level of resources applied to our business 
management and our board of directors make these decisions on the basis of sales forecasts  expected customer orders  economic conditions  and other factors 
these costs are primarily personnel and facilities costs that are relatively fixed in the short term and directly impact net income 
year overview in the first quarter of  we began marketing the olympic cool cap  a class iii medical device 
the cool cap system  which is the only fda approved device for the treatment of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy hie in term newborns  provides selective head cooling to prevent or reduce the severity of neurologic injury associated with hie 
in june we put a hold on domestic shipments of cool cap units in order to update some of the components used in its manufacture and submitted a pma supplement to the fda in october seeking approval of the component updates 
the fda approved the pma supplement on february   however  we were unable to ship any cool cap units in the us during the second half of our inability to ship cool cap units in the us also affected our sales of the olympic cerebral function monitor  as the cool cap and cfm are sold into level three nicu s together as a system 

table of contents in october we received a warning letter from the fda that focused on process deficiencies at our olympic facility in seattle  washington 
as a result  we initiated a voluntary plant shutdown for the month of november after reviewing processes at the facility  we responded to the fda s warning letter in late november to date  the fda has had no further communication with us concerning this matter 
on november  we acquired excel tech ltd 
xltek for million 
xltek  based in oakville  ontario  canada and which was publicly traded on the toronto exchange  develops and markets computer based electrodiagnostic systems and disposable supplies used by medical practitioners to aid in the detection  diagnosis  and monitoring of neurologic and sleep disorders 
xltek reported revenue of approximately million during its fiscal year ended january  shortly after the acquisition of xltek we initiated integration and restructuring activities at their facility that resulted in an immediate reduction of employees  with further cost synergies expected later in the second half of application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates of america gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective and  consequently  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material affect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  from sales of medical devices and supplies  including sales to distributors  when a purchase order has been received  when title transfers  when the selling price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of certain eeg and psg systems is recognized in accordance with fasb statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  wherein revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
terms of sale for most domestic sales are fob origin  reflecting that title and risk of loss are assumed by the purchaser at the shipping point  however  terms of sale for some neurology and sleep diagnostic systems are fob destination  reflecting that title and risk of loss are assumed by the purchaser upon delivery 
terms of sales to international distributors are exw  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 
revenue from extended service and maintenance agreements  for both medical devices and data management systems  is recognized ratably over the service period 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as otherwise described above 
we generally do not provide rights of return on products 
we accept trade ins of our own and competitive medical devices 
trade ins are recorded as a reduction of the replacement medical device sale 
provisions are made for initial standard warranty obligations of one year  and post sale training and customer support at the time the related revenue is recognized 
negotiated pricing and discounts for sales subject to gpo contract terms are recognized as a reduction of the selling price of our products 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we must exercise judgment when assessing the sufficiency of our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimates are based on our historical collection experience within the markets in which we operate  assessment of our average accounts receivable aging days  and any other specific information of which we may be aware  such as bankruptcy filings or liquidity problems of our customers 
based on the results of our analyses  activity associated with our provision for doubtful accounts has historically been within our expectations 
any future determination that our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is not properly stated could result in a change in our operating expenses and results of operations 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value as a medical device manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or being held in quantities that exceed anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable salvage value 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
carrying value of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives or any determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their estimated fair value could result in additional charges 
we carry goodwill and any other intangible assets with indefinite lives at original cost but do not amortize them 
any future determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their estimated fair value could result in additional charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
we test our definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  appropriate discount rates  and operating margins 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually as of october st  this assessment is also performed whenever there is a change in circumstances that indicates the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to the basis of the underlying net assets of such reporting unit 
to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units  we utilize subjective valuations based upon discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and costs  and appropriate discount rates  as use of a higher rate will result in a lower estimate of fair value 
in performing the discounted cash flow analysis  we use discount rates consistent with the risk adjusted discount rates utilized in our valuation analyses pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
use of discount rates that were of the rates we utilized would have had no impact on the conclusions we reached in our impairment analysis 

table of contents liability for product warranties our medical device products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our medical device products during these service periods 
we base the liability in part upon our historical experience  however  estimates of the costs to honor our warranties are often difficult to determine due to uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new products will require servicing and the costs that will be incurred to service those products 
until we have historical experience of the cost to honor warranties on new products  we base additions to the reserve on a combination of factors including the standard cost of the product  experience with similar products  and other judgments  such as the degree to which the product incorporates new technology 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and reductions in our operating profits and results of operations 
share based compensation on january   we adopted sfas r  share based compensation  using the modified prospective approach 
with the adoption of sfas r  the company now records the fair value of share based compensation awards as expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  expected term  and forfeiture rate 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  expected stock price volatility  expected life  and forfeiture rate assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
if we used different assumptions  we would have recorded different amounts of share based compensation 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
percent of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and selling research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes income tax provision net income loss 
table of contents acquisitions we completed four significant acquisitions during and  and the timing of these acquisitions had an impact on the comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and xltek 
this acquisition was completed on november  xltek reported revenue of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition 
olympic medical 
this acquisition was completed on october  olympic reported revenue of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition 
deltamed 
this acquisition was completed on september  deltamed reported revenue of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition 
bio logic 
this acquisition was completed on january  bio logic reported revenue of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition 
comparison of and operating results we analyze our revenue from two perspectives 
because our acquisitions have been significant  we measure the contribution to consolidated revenue of the businesses we acquire 
we also analyze our revenue as coming from two sources sales of devices and systems  and sales of related supplies and services 
we report freight revenue separate from these two sources 
our revenue increased  or million  to million in  from million in xltek contributed to million of our revenue in olympic and deltamed contributed to million of the increase

at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the revolving credit facility and there was an outstanding balance of million under the term loan and million under the revolving line of credit 
the company has granted wells fargo a security interest in all of the assets of the company 
as a result of our acquisition of xltek  our cash reserves and working capital have been significantly reduced 
however  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue to acquire additional technologies  products or businesses  and these acquisitions could be significant 
these actions would likely affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships  or other arrangements

future liquidity our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue  extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  extent to which we make acquisitions  cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  cost and timing of marketing and selling activities  and availability of borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments result primarily from firm  noncancellable purchase orders placed with contract vendors that manufacture some of the components used in our medical devices and related disposable supply products  as well as commitments for leased office  manufacturing  and warehouse facilities 
on november  we entered into a million revolving credit facility and million term loan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the u 
s  canada  and europe and sell those products primarily in the us  europe  and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
most of our sales in europe and asia are denominated in us dollars and euros and with the acquisition of xltek in november  a small portion of our sales are now denominated in canadian dollars 
as our sales in currencies other than the us dollar increase  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
in addition  changes in exchange rates also may affect the end user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors  who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing 
these factors may make our products less competitive in some countries 
if the us dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net income would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments and cash equivalents 
however  as substantially all of our short term investments carry a fixed rate of interest  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  through the date of maturity on those investments 
the fair value of our short term investments and cash equivalents is also sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  and the fair value of our portfolio will fall if market interest rates increase 

table of contents however  since we generally have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
at december  we did not hold any short term investments or cash equivalents with maturities greater than days 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio  and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
off balance sheet arrangements under our bylaws  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director s serving in such capacity 
we have a directors and officers liability insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid resulting from the indemnification of our officers and directors 
in addition  we enter into indemnification agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business 
in some cases we have obtained liability insurance providing coverage that limits our exposure for these other indemnified matters 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and have not recorded a liability for these agreements as of december  we had no other off balance sheet arrangements during any of fiscal  or that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity
