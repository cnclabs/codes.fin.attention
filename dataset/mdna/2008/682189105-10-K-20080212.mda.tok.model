table of contents manufacturing operations we operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture 
five of these facilities are front end wafer sites located in japan  slovakia  the czech republic  malaysia and the united states  and three of such facilities are assembly and test sites located in china  malaysia and the philippines 
in addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations  our facility in roznov  czech republic manufactures silicon wafers that are used by a number of our facilities 
the table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture  as well as the reporting segments that use these facilities

this facility is owned by a joint venture company  leshan phoenix semiconductor company limited leshan  of which we own a majority of the outstanding equity interests 
our investment in leshan has been consolidated in our financial statements 
our joint venture partner  leshan radio company ltd  is formerly a state owned enterprise 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture 
each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder  provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity in lieu of satisfying the commitment 
we committed to purchase of leshan s production capacity in and in both and and are currently committed to purchase approximately of leshan s expected production capacity in in and  we did not incur any underutilization charges 
in  we incurred million in underutilization charges 
as part of our manufacturing agreements with leshan  we supply die used in the production process 
the leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations  and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility 
in june  we obtained approval from the chinese government for the leshan joint venture to invest up to million in semiconductor operations  
table of contents which is in addition to the million originally approved 
in  we committed to make capital contributions of approximately million to this joint venture by  subject to market conditions 
we have the ability to time these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand 
in  we acquired an additional interest in our investment in leshan for million  for which the incremental interest in the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets had an estimated fair value of million resulting in million of goodwill 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods 
our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts 
in some cases  longer term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship 
these contract manufacturers  including ait  ase  kec  magnachip  phenitec and psi  accounted for approximately  and of our manufacturing costs in  and  respectively 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use many raw materials  including silicon wafers  gold  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources generally on a just in time basis  and material agreements with our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations are reflected in our table showing commitments  contingencies and indemnities in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this report 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
sales  marketing and distribution as of december   our global sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately professionals operating out of approximately offices which serve customers in countries 
we support our customers through logistics organizations and just in time warehouses 
global and regional distribution channels further support our customers needs for quick response and service 
we offer efficient  cost effective internet based applications support from our laboratories in the czech republic  china and the united states 
through on line connectivity  applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions 
since  our cost structure related to freight  shipping and logistical services has been improved as a result of our newest global distribution centers in the philippines and shanghai  china  which also resulted in improved domestic shipping and customs clearance operations 
we continue to monitor our freight and logistical support operations for potential cost savings 
patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights we market our products under our registered trademark on semiconductor and our on logo 
we own rights to a number of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business 
in connection with our recapitalization  motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us  as the case may be  certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business 
as of january   we had approximately us and foreign patents and approximately patent applications pending worldwide 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from to none of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business 
additionally  we have rights to more than registered and common law trademarks 
our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate 

table of contents as part of the recapitalization  motorola assigned to us approximately us patents and patent applications  approximately foreign patents and patent applications  rights to over trademarks not including the motorola name previously used in connection with our products  rights in know how relating to at least semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials 
in addition  motorola licensed on a nonexclusive  royalty free basis other patent  trademark  copyright and know how rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our long range plans 
we have perpetual  royalty free  worldwide rights under motorola s patent portfolio and other intellectual property  existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter the five year period existing only with respect to patents  as necessary to manufacture  market and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines 
additionally  motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization  which assisted us in developing our own patent position and licensing program 
through these arrangements  we have the right to use a significant amount of motorola owned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer 
seasonality our revenues have been affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the seasonal trends of related end markets 
in  and  this pattern has shifted to more of a seasonally soft first half with a stronger second half as our products have increasingly become more consumer driven 
backlog our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders or customer agreements that are booked as far as weeks in advance of delivery 
generally  prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking 
backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our electronic data interface customers  in each case scheduled to be shipped over the week period following such date 
backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
because we record revenues on a sell through basis  backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered 
during  our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between and of actual revenues during such quarter 
as manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases  customers tend to order products further in advance and  as a result  backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase 
in the semiconductor industry  backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs 
agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or  as a matter of industry practice  are often not enforced 
therefore  a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable 
for these reasons  the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results 
we sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just in time principles while shortening the cycle times required for producing ordered products 
however  these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations 
competition the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for general purpose semiconductor products like ours  is highly competitive 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies  as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
because our components are often building block 
table of contents semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
see part i  item a risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business elsewhere in this report 
we compete with respect to our four primary operating segments automotive and power regulation  computing products  digital and consumer products and standard products in the following manner automotive and power regulation the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation  technical performance  quality  service and price 
our competitive strengths in this group are our strong technology and design resources  our industry recognition in applications  such as automotive and computing  and our market share 
our significant competitors in this market include fairchild  linear technology  maxim  national semiconductor  st microelectronics and texas instruments 
several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
a competitive challenge in this group is our small market share with certain japanese automotive customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs 
if we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase  in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase 
computing products the principal methods of competition in this group are technical performance  total cost of solution ownership  quality and assurance of supply 
our dual edge architecture for our microprocessor and ddr memory controllers offers a competitive cost of ownership and performance position to compete with incumbent suppliers 
in addition  the breadth of our portfolio in other support functions dc dc converters  over voltage protection fets and analog give us the opportunity to serve multiple requirements and allow customers to control their vendor lists more easily 
our significant competitors in this market include intersil  international rectifier  fairchild  and infineon 
several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
digital and consumer products the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation  especially in packaging  technical performance  price  quality and assurance of supply 
our competitive strengths in this group are our ability to put rf and emi filters and fets products in ever smaller packages without significantly degrading performance 
our significant competitors in this market include national  maxim  fairchild  infineon  international rectifier  philips  st microelectronics and vishay 
several of these competitors are larger in scale and size  have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
standard products our competitive strength in this area is the breadth of our portfolio  our low cost structure  high quality and our supply chain management which ensures supply to key customers 
the principal methods of competition in this group are new product innovation and constantly introducing new packages and performance spins on existing products 
of particular importance are our over voltage protection portfolios esd protection  tvs 
table of contents zeners and our clock management and distribution portfolios where we enjoy significant performance advantages over our competition 
our significant competitors in this market include fairchild  diodes  nxp  international rectifier  vishay  micrel  idt ics  st microelectronics  texas instruments and semtech 
research and development company sponsored research and development costs in  and were million of revenue  million of revenue and million of revenues  respectively 
our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
during  research and development spend increased due to the porting of existing products  development of new products and expansion of our digital production capabilities in our gresham fab 
it is our practice to regularly re evaluate our research and development spending  to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly 
we deploy people and capital with the goal to maximize our investment in research and development and to position us for continued growth 
as such  we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity analog  standard component  mos power and clock and data management products 
we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 
government regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances  the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites  and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination 
our manufacturing facility in phoenix  arizona is located on property that is a superfund site  a property listed on the national priorities list and subject to clean up activities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of on site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the state of arizona 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter 
during the fourth quarter  we entered into an agreement to sell the wafer fabrication facility and associated land at our phoenix site 
the sale is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of during the second quarter of we entered into an agreement to sell three parcels of land at our phoenix site totaling approximately acres 
these sales are expected to be finalized by the end of additionally  one of our unused buildings at our phoenix site is currently being marketed for sale 
manufacturing facilities in slovakia and the czech republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by government owned entities 
in each matter  these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on site and off site with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations 
the governments of the czech republic and slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries  subject to specified limitations  for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination 
based upon the information available  we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material 
our design center in east greenwich  rhode island is located on property that has localized soil contamination 
when we purchased the east greenwich facility  we entered into a settlement agreement and covenant not to sue with the state of rhode island 
this agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property 
based on the information available  we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material 

table of contents we believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
we do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and liability for currently known environmental conditions  to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
it is possible  however  that future developments  including changes in laws and regulations  government policies  customer specification  personnel and physical property conditions  including currently undiscovered contamination  could lead to material costs 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
we do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees  except for those arrangements  such as workers councils  that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law

if any of the following trends  risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected  the trading prices of our securities could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to the potential merger and reorganization of amis with and into orange acquisition corporation  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company merger sub the issuance of shares of our common stock to amis stockholders in the potential merger will substantially dilute the interest held by our stockholders prior to the merger 
as soon as practicable  a special meeting of our stockholders will be held to vote on the merger between amis and us  as well as other items further elaborated on in amendment no 
to the form s filed with the sec on february  if the merger is completed  we will issue up to approximately million shares of our common stock in the merger 
based on the number of shares amis common stock outstanding and our common stock outstanding on the respective record dates  amis stockholders will own in the aggregate  approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after the merger on a fully diluted basis 
the issuance of shares of our common stock to amis stockholders in the merger and to holders of assumed options and restricted stock unit awards to acquire shares of amis common stock will cause a 
table of contents significant reduction in the relative percentage interest of our current stockholders in earnings  voting  liquidation value and book and market value 
the uncertainty about the completion of the merger and the diversion of management could harm us  whether or not the merger is completed 
in response to the announcement of the potential merger with amis  our existing or prospective customers may delay or defer their purchasing or other decisions  or they may seek to change their existing business relationship 
in addition  as a result of the merger  current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with us  and we could lose key employees as a result 
in addition to retention  these uncertainties may also impair our ability to recruit or motivate key personnel 
completion of the merger will also require a significant amount of time and attention from management 
the diversion of management attention away from ongoing operations could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships 
failure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock price  future business  and financial results 
completion of the merger is conditioned upon  among other things  the receipt of certain antitrust approvals under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions  and approval of our stockholders and of amis s stockholders 
there is no assurance that we will receive all of the necessary approvals or satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger 
failure to complete the proposed merger could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger 
we will also remain liable for significant transaction costs  including legal  accounting and financial advisory fees 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether the merger will occur 
consequently  the completion of  or failure to complete  the merger could result in a significant change in the market price of our common stock 
the ability to complete the merger with amis is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities  which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or could cause us to abandon the merger 
in deciding whether to grant antitrust and competition approvals  the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the merger on competition within their relevant jurisdictions 
the terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted  if accepted  may impose requirements  limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business following the merger 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals or that any other conditions  terms  obligations or restrictions sought to be imposed  and if accepted  would not have a material adverse effect on us following the merger 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that these conditions  terms  obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger 
for additional information  see note pending acquisition of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion 
the anticipated benefits of the merger with amis  including anticipated costs savings  may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations 
due to legal restrictions  we are able to conduct only limited planning regarding the integration of amis with us prior to completion of the merger 
we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two companies 
delays in this process could adversely affect our business  financial results  financial condition and stock price following the merger 
we estimate that approximately million in pre tax savings in may be achieved through the integration of amis into our business and rationalization of our combined infrastructure with amis 
as with any 
table of contents estimate  it is possible that the estimates of the potential cost savings could turn out to be incorrect 
moreover  even if we were able to integrate amis s business operations successfully  there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  cost savings  innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 
additionally  as a condition to their approval of the merger  regulatory agencies may impose requirements  limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our combined business with amis 
if we were able to agree to these requirements  limitations  costs  divestitures or restrictions with amis and the regulatory agencies  then our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be impaired 
we will incur significant transaction and merger related costs in connection with the merger with amis 
we expect to incur significant costs associated with completing the merger and combining the operations ami with our business 
the exact magnitude of these costs is not yet known 
in addition  there may be unanticipated costs associated with the integration 
although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and other efficiencies may offset incremental transaction and merger related costs over time  these benefits may not be achieved in the near term  or at all 
resales of shares of our common stock following the merger with amis  additional obligations to issue shares of our common stock and repurchases of our common stock may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 
as of february   we had approximately  million shares of common stock outstanding and approximately  million shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and other rights to purchase or acquire its shares 
we currently expect that we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with the merger 
the issuance of these new shares of our common stock and the sale of additional shares of our common stock that may become eligible for sale in the public market from time to time upon exercise of options including a substantial number of our options that will replace existing amis options and other equity linked securities could have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock 
in connection with the announcement of the merger agreement and the merger with amis  we also announced that we have increased the number of shares of our common stock authorized for repurchase under our share repurchase program from million shares to million shares 
any repurchases could have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock above levels that would have otherwise prevailed or preventing or slowing a decline in the market price of our common stock 
see later in this report risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business for risks associated with a purported stockholder class action lawsuit against amis and others in connection with the proposed merger between amis and us  and risk factors trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness for risks associated with the repayment or refinancing of amis s debt concurrent with the completion of the proposed merger between amis and us 
trends  risks and uncertainties related to other aspects of our business we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and operating losses in the future 
at times our historical financial results have been subject to substantial fluctuations and during those times we have experienced declines in revenues and operating losses 
although  recently  we have experienced some strength in our results over the course of the past couple fiscal years  reduced end user demand  price declines  excess inventory  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our 
table of contents business  and we may experience declines in revenue and operating losses in the future 
in order to remain profitable  we must continue to successfully implement our business plan  including our cost reduction initiatives 
we also currently face an environment of uncertain demand and pricing pressure in the markets our products address 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our recent profitability 
we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles for semiconductors and for the end user products in which they are used and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
in some ways  we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future 
we can not accurately predict the timing of future downturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these downturns might be 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to fully recover from downturns  could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience difficulties in operating the gresham manufacturing facility  including the inability to utilize this additional capacity in a cost efficient manner and to successfully develop new products which can be manufactured in this facility 
on may   we acquired the gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility and hired substantially all of the manufacturing and engineering employees working at the gresham facility 
our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipated from the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility depend in large part upon whether we are able to operate this facility in an efficient and cost effective manner 
if we are unable to operate this facility successfully  we may be unable to realize the cost savings  revenue growth  gross margin improvement  earnings growth and other anticipated benefits we expected to achieve as a result of the acquisition and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in connection with the acquisition of the gresham manufacturing facility  we entered into a supply contract with lsi  the previous owner of the facility  which is due to expire on may  at the end of  lsi will no longer have any obligation to purchase a minimum commitment under this supply contract  and their purchases may decrease significantly 
thereafter  our ability to generate operating profits in the gresham manufacturing facility will likely depend upon our successful development of new products that can be produced using the technology of the gresham manufacturing facility  as well as our ability to transfer existing products to the gresham manufacturing facility 
failure to successfully develop or integrate new products into the gresham manufacturing facility or to successfully market those new products could result in a loss of market share in the industry or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and ultimately could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
our gross profit is dependent on a number of factors  including our level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit was for  compared to for  and for gross profit improved in and as a result of increased sales volume and or cost savings from our profitability enhancement programs 
the lower gross profit rate in is attributable to lower manufacturing services revenue in and a full year of operating expenses 
increased competition and other factors may lead to price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 

table of contents the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of  our profitability enhancement programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives in response to  among other things  significant downturns in our industry 
these initiatives have included accelerating our manufacturing moves into lower cost regions  transitioning higher cost external supply to internal manufacturing  working with our material suppliers to further lower costs  personnel reductions  reductions in employee compensation  temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead 
we recorded net restructuring charges of million in  million in  and million in to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives over the past three years 
these costs were primarily comprised of employee separation costs and asset impairments as well as gains on the sale of assets and insurance recoveries 
on january   we announced that we intend to accelerate our stand alone cost reduction programs including a continued focus on the consolidation of our manufacturing operations 
over the course of the next to months or so  we have identified a total of over million in annualized savings through actions that we have already taken and actions we expect to take 
the rate of these savings is expected to increase over that period to greater than million per quarter 
however  we cannot assure you that these cost reduction initiatives will be successfully implemented  or will sufficiently help us sustain our profitability 
because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the cost reductions could adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseeable factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
our present business strategy to build upon our position as a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components includes  without limitation  plans to continue to aggressively manage  maintain and refine our product portfolio  continue to develop leading edge customer support services  further expand our just in time delivery capabilities  increase our die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner  further reduce the number of our product platforms and process flows  rationalize our manufacturing operations  relocate manufacturing operations or outsource to lower cost regions  reduce selling and administrative expenses  manage capital expenditures to forecasted production demands  actively manage working capital  develop new products in a more efficient manner  and focus on the development of power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
in particular  we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential  increase our volume or revenue  rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses 
our business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products and the new products and applications that we are developing and on our ability to produce our products profitably 
each of these factors depends on our ability  among other things  to finance our operating and product development activities  maintain high quality and efficient manufacturing operations  relocate and close manufacturing facilities and reduce operating expenses as part of our ongoing cost restructuring with minimal disruption to our operations  access quality raw materials and contract manufacturing services in a cost effective and timely manner  protect our intellectual property portfolio and attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and finance personnel 
several of these and other factors that could affect our ability to implement our business strategy  such as risks associated with international operations  the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict and terrorist activities  increased competition  legal developments and general economic conditions  are beyond our control 
in addition  circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy 

table of contents we may be unable to make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
we are committed to maintaining spending on new product development in order to stay competitive in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could adversely affect our business 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we routinely purchase inventory based on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers  or both  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
furthermore  short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers 
an inability to introduce new products could adversely affect us  and changing technologies or consumption patterns could reduce the demand for our products 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries that are currently the primary end users of semiconductors 
as these industries evolve and introduce new products  our success will depend on our ability to predict and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by designing  developing  manufacturing  marketing and providing customer support for our own new products and technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify changes in the product markets and requirements of our customers and end users and adapt to such changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
nor can we assure you that products or technologies that may be developed in the future by our competitors and others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end users could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the semiconductor industry  particularly the market for semiconductor components  is highly competitive 
as a result of the recent economic downturn  competition in the markets in which we operate has intensified  as manufacturers of semiconductor components have offered reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines  we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
the semiconductor components industry has also been undergoing significant restructuring and consolidations that could adversely affect our competitiveness 
many of our competitors  particularly larger 
table of contents competitors resulting from consolidations  may have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products  longer independent operating histories and presence in key markets  patent protection  and greater name recognition 
because our components are often building block semiconductors that  in some cases  are integrated into more complex integrated circuits  we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits  application specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits  as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products 
we compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price  quality  technical performance  product features  product system compatibility  customized design  strategic relationships with customers  new product innovation  availability  delivery timing and reliability and customer sales and technical support 
gross margins in the industry vary by geographic region depending on local demand for the products in which semiconductors are used  such as personal computers  industrial and telecommunications equipment  consumer electronics and automotive goods 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity  if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we could be required to incur significant capital expenditures for manufacturing and information technology and equipment to remain competitive  the failure  inadequacy or delayed implementation of which could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 
semiconductor manufacturing has historically required  a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
we have made substantial capital expenditures and installed significant production capacity to support new technologies and increased production volume 
we also may incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies to increase our productivity and efficiency 
any such implementation  however  can be negatively impacted by failures or inadequacies of the new manufacturing or information technology and unforeseen delays in its implementation  any of which may require us to spend additional resources to correct these problems or  in some instances  to conclude that the new technology implementation should be abandoned 
in the case of abandonment  we may have to recognize losses for amounts previously expended in connection with such implementation that have been capitalized on our balance sheet 

table of contents ultimately  we may be required to increase our future capital expenditures to meet our operational needs in  among other areas  manufacturing  information technology and equipment 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in these or other areas 
in addition  our principal credit agreement limits the amount of our capital expenditures which may restrict our ability to make expenditures we feel are necessary to be operationally successful 
if we were to lose one of our large customers our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
product sales to our ten largest customers have traditionally accounted for a significant amount of our business 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries  and  in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered 
generally  our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products 
we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future or that the loss of one or more of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
the loss of our sources of raw materials or manufacturing services  or increases in the prices of such goods or services  could adversely affect our operations and productivity 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of our raw materials increase significantly or their quality deteriorates 
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials  including polysilicon  silicon wafers  gold  copper lead frames  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
generally  our agreements with suppliers impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations  and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just in time basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of raw materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 
in addition  for some of our products  we are dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized suppliers for required components and materials 
the number of qualified alternative suppliers for these kinds of technologies is extremely limited 
we cannot assure you that we will not lose our suppliers for these key technologies or that our suppliers will be able to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules 
disruption or termination of our limited supply sources for these components and materials could delay our shipments of products utilizing these technologies and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
we also use third party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities  primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods 
our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts  and in some cases require longer term commitments in the early stages of the relationship 
our operations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated  the cost of such services increased significantly  the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasts proved to be materially incorrect 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties  including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses  incurring additional debt  assuming contingent liabilities or diluting our existing stockholders 
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities  we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions  mergers and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require  among other things  efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
among other concerns  successful 
table of contents acquisitions and alliances are subject to the following risks and uncertainties the difficulty of integrating  aligning and coordinating organization  which will likely be geographically separated and involve separate technologies and corporate cultures  the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  the risk of diverting the attention of senior management and other key employees from our day to day operations and key research and development  marketing or sales efforts  the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience  risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems  difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses  and future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business 
in addition  key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change in control agreements  acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity based compensation rights 
in addition  we may also issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or alliances  which could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions and alliances  which could harm our operating results 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our results of operations 
a significant amount of our total revenue is derived from the asia pacific region and europe including the middle east  respectively 
we maintain significant operations in seremban  malaysia  carmona  the philippines  aizu  japan  leshan  china  roznov  the czech republic  and piestany  the slovak republic 
in addition  we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia pacific region 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets 
risks inherent in doing business on an international level include  among others  the following economic and political instability including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  transportation delays  power supply shortages and shutdowns  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other labor problems  currency convertibility and repatriation  taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel  and other risks relating to the administration of or changes in  or new interpretations of  the laws  regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
our activities outside the united states are subject to additional risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
while our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  worldwide semiconductor pricing is influenced by currency rate fluctuations 
if we fail to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  our results of operations and competitive position could deteriorate 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and financial personnel 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
for example  
table of contents analog component designers are difficult to attract and retain  and the failure to attract and retain analog component designers could compromise our ability to keep pace with our competitors in the market for analog components 
we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time 
we have also issued restricted stock units with time based vesting 
our stock price at times has declined substantially  reducing the effectiveness of these incentives 
loss of the services of  or failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel  including senior managers and design engineers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we use a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
some of that intellectual property is currently subject to disputes with third parties  and litigation could arise in the future 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications and we cannot assure you that any of the substantial number of us and foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business  including those that motorola assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization  will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  the license rights granted by motorola in connection with our recapitalization will provide competitive advantages to us  the license rights granted by adi in connection with the ptc business will provide competitive advantage to us  the license rights granted by lsi in connection with our acquisition of its gresham  oregon semiconductor manufacturing facility will provide competitive advantage to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  any of the trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  know how or mask works that motorola has assigned  licensed or sublicensed to us in connection with our recapitalization will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  abandoned or licensed to others  or any of our pending or future trademark  copyright  or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in the united states and in foreign countries 
also  we may from time to time in the future be notified of claims that we may be infringing third party patents or other intellectual property rights 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
litigation could cause us to incur significant expense  by adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale or importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies  
table of contents discontinue the use of processes  or obtain licenses to the infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any such development or acquisition or that any such licenses would be available to us on reasonable terms 
any such development  acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources 
we will also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research 
we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights  which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 
our ability to enforce our patents  copyrights  software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks  as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries 
when we seek to enforce our rights  we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid  is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim 
in addition  our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us  which may adversely impact our business 
an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or  in cases for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products  which could in turn negatively affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we can provide no assurances as to the outcome of these claims asserted by other parties with respect to their alleged intellectual property rights 
we are subject to litigation risks  including securities class action litigation  which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit  including securities class action litigation that may be particularly costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters  most of which we consider routine matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these routine matters typically fall into broad categories such as those involving suppliers and customers  employment and labor  and intellectual property 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as mentioned above  from time to time  we have been  or may in the future be  involved in securities litigation 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any securities litigation matter in which we are party 
these types of matters are costly to defend and even if resolved in our favor  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities litigation could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
because the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile  we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future 
see part i  item  legal proceedings of this report for more information on our legal proceedings  including our pending securities class action litigation 
in addition to our own litigation matters  on december   a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in bannock county  idaho district court against amis  its directors  and two of amis s 
table of contents largest stockholders alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to amis s stockholders in connection with the proposed merger between amis and us 
while amis believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend against it vigorously  this litigation may have a material adverse effect on the potential merger or on our financial condition if it continues past the consummation of the merger 
for additional information regarding this amis lawsuit  see the section entitled the merger litigation relating to the merger in our amendment no 
to the form s filed with the sec on february  we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards  including section of the sarbanes oxley act 
like most publicly traded companies  we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm 
we have completed this section process for fiscal  and have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  however  we have not been able to ascertain the impact that the merger with amis will have in the future on our ability to maintain internal control over financial reporting 
amis reported in its quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended september  that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of september  as a result of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting 
see amis s quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended september  for more information on this material weakness 
we have not assessed the impact that amis s material weakness will have on our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting  and will not be able to adequately do so until after the proposed merger is completed 
there can be no assurance that the combined company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined company s internal controls in the future 
if internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  the combined company may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and stock price 
see part ii  item a controls and procedures of this report for information on disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
environmental and other regulatory matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air  water and ground 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  which  among other things  regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances 
motorola has agreed to indemnify us for environmental and health and safety liabilities related to the conduct or operations of our business or motorola s ownership  occupancy or use of real property occurring prior to the closing of our recapitalization 
we also have purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances 
however  we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance policy will cover all material environmental costs 
in addition  the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities related to events or activities occurring after our recapitalization 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any liability for currently known environmental conditions  will not have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects 
however  we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  
table of contents the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions 
warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the electrical design  original equipment manufacturers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves  or a requirement that we participate in a product recall  would have adverse effects that could be material on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could impair our financial condition and adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial debt service obligations 
in addition  we may incur additional debt in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in our debt instruments 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors  including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations  some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates  our debt agreements contain  and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain  financial and restrictive covenants  and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us  our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the semiconductor industry  and our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors who have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures 

table of contents we may incur more debt and may require additional capital in the future to service this new debt  which could exacerbate the risks described above 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness currently restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  but do not fully prohibit our subsidiaries from doing so 
while we expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents for the next months  if we incur additional debt  the related risks that we now face could intensify and it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to service this new debt and to fund our future activities 
moreover  some of the debt we may incur may be secured by the same collateral securing certain of our existing indebtedness 
ultimately  we may not be able to obtain additional funding on favorable terms  or at all  and we may need to curtail our operations significantly  reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development  or be forced to obtain funds through arrangements that management did not anticipate  including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies or other activities that may impair our ability to remain competitive 
in addition  if the proposed merger with amis is completed  we will be required to repay or refinance all of amis s outstanding debt concurrent with completion of the merger 
as of september   the aggregate principal amount of amis s outstanding debt was approximately million 
we expect to refinance all or a portion of amis s outstanding debt with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from one or multiple financing transactions  including pursuant to the accordion feature of our existing senior bank credit facility  factoring arrangements  sale leaseback transactions and additional debt financing  which we are currently exploring but for which we do not have contractual commitments 
although the total dollar amount of this refinancing could be significant  we do not believe that it will impair the ability of our combined businesses to maintain sufficient working capital 
we believe that we will be able to successfully complete the repayment or refinancing of amis s outstanding debt  although due to prevailing market conditions  such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us 
the agreements relating to our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take some actions 
our debt agreements contain  and any future debt agreements may include  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  including guarantees  incur liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make investments  loans or advances  make some acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  pay dividends  redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments  pay dividends from semiconductor components industries  llc to on semiconductor corporation  engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into new lines of business  issue some types of preferred stock  and enter into transactions with our affiliates 
any future debt could contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those that are currently applicable 

table of contents our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness  including as a result of events beyond our control  could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  either upon maturity or if accelerated upon an event of default or  if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control  that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities 
further  if we are unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt  the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling additional assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
the terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all  or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
trends  risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a large portion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from our customers  including cancellations and reschedulings  the timing of introduction of new products  the gain or loss of significant customers  including as a result of industry consolidation  seasonality in some of our target markets  changes in the mix of products we sell  changes in demand by the end users of our customers products  market acceptance of our current and future products  variability of our customers product life cycles  changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold  such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  
table of contents changes in the prices of our products  which can be affected by the level of our customers and end users demand  technological change  product obsolescence  competition or other factors  cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third party manufacturers  including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements  our liquidity and access to capital  and our research and development activities and the funding thereof 
our stock price may be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors in our securities 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
further  if the merger with amis fails to be completed our stock price may also be adversely affected 
see failure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock prices and our future business and financial results risk factor above 
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  new products or product enhancements  loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  and additions or departures of key personnel 
the trading price of our common stock since our initial public offering has had a significant variance and we can not accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price 
provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions create a board of directors with staggered terms  permit only our board of directors or the chairman of our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval  and require the approval by holders of at least of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 

table of contents although we believe these provisions make a higher third party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

item properties in the united states  our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing  design center  and research and development operations are located in approximately million square feet of building space on property that we own in phoenix  arizona 
we also lease properties around the world for use as sales offices  design centers  research and development labs  warehouses  logistic centers and trading offices 
the size and or location of these properties change from time to time based on business requirements 
we operate distribution centers  which are leased or contracted through a third party  in locations throughout asia  europe and the americas 
we own our manufacturing facilities in the united states  japan  malaysia  the philippines  slovakia and the czech republic 
these facilities are primarily manufacturing operations  but also include office  utility  laboratory  warehouse and unused space 
our joint venture in leshan  china also owns manufacturing  warehouse  laboratory  office and unused space 
in december  we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in east greenwich  rhode island 
we completed this closure during the fourth quarter of we transferred the production from this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities 
we completed the sale of the manufacturing facility in the fourth quarter of we still own and occupy an approximately  square foot design center in east greenwich  rhode island 
in the second quarter of  we purchased an approximately  square foot manufacturing facility in gresham  oregon 
this site is acres and includes  square feet of clean room 
as part of our recapitalization  motorola conveyed to us the surface rights to a portion of the land located at our phoenix facility  excluding the subsurface rights  and conveyed buildings located at the phoenix facility 
these buildings do not include any treatment facilities relating to motorola s environmental clean up operations at the phoenix facility 
we executed a declaration of covenants  easements and restrictions with motorola providing access easements for the parties and granting to us options to purchase or to lease the subsurface rights of the land 
in  we announced plans to sell unused portions of the phoenix  arizona location 
in october  we sold a portion of the phoenix  arizona site that included an unused warehouse and unused parking lot 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell the wafer fabrication facility and associated land at our phoenix site 
the sale is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of during the second quarter of we entered into an agreement to sell three parcels of land at our phoenix site totaling approximately acres 
these sales are expected to be finalized by the end of additionally  one of our unused buildings at our phoenix site is currently being marketed for sale 
the remainder of the phoenix site will continue as our corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing  design center and research and development facility 
we believe that our facilities around the world  whether owned or leased  are well maintained 
we believe that we have sufficient access to productive capacity to meet our needs for the majority of the products in our business lines for the foreseeable future

table of contents item legal proceedings we currently are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters  including the matters described or referred to in the next paragraphs  will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation  should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable  our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
securities class action litigation during the period july  through july   we were named as a defendant in three shareholder class action lawsuits that were filed in federal court in new york city against us and certain of our former officers  current and former directors and the underwriters for our initial public offering 
the lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and have been docketed in the us district court for the southern district of new york as abrams v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no cv  breuer v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv  and cohen v 
on semiconductor corp  et al  ca no 
cv district court 
on april   the plaintiffs filed a single consolidated amended complaint that supersedes the individual complaints originally filed 
the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the underwriters of our initial public offering improperly required their customers to pay the underwriters excessive commissions and to agree to buy additional shares of our common stock in the aftermarket as conditions of receiving shares in our initial public offering 
the amended complaint further alleges that these supposed practices of the underwriters should have been disclosed in our initial public offering prospectus and registration statement 
the amended complaint alleges violations of both the registration and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages 
we understand that various other plaintiffs have filed substantially similar class action cases against approximately other publicly traded companies and their public offering underwriters in new york city  which have all been transferred  along with the case against us  to a single federal district court judge for purposes of coordinated case management 
we believe that the claims against us are without merit and have defended  and intend to continue to defend  the litigation vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain  however  and we cannot guarantee that the outcome of these claims will be favorable for us 
on july   together with the other issuer defendants  we filed a collective motion to dismiss the consolidated  amended complaints against the issuers on various legal grounds common to all or most of the issuer defendants 
the underwriters also filed separate motions to dismiss the claims against them 
in addition  the parties have stipulated to the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of our individual former officers and current and former directors who were named as defendants in our litigation  and they are no longer parties to the litigation 
on february   the district court issued its ruling on the motions to dismiss filed by the underwriter and issuer defendants 
in that ruling the district court granted in part and denied in part those motions 
as to the claims brought against us under the antifraud provisions of the securities laws  the district court dismissed all of these claims with prejudice  and refused to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to re plead these claims 
as to the claims brought under the registration provisions of the securities laws  which do not require that intent to defraud be pleaded  the district court denied the motion to dismiss these claims as to us and as to substantially all of the other issuer defendants as well 
the district court also denied the underwriter defendants motion to dismiss in all respects 
in june  upon the determination of a special independent committee of our board of directors  we elected to participate in a proposed settlement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
had it been approved by the district court  this proposed settlement would have resulted in the dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elected to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
this proposed settlement was conditioned on  among other things  a ruling by the district court that the claims against us and against the other issuers who had agreed to the settlement would 
table of contents be certified for class action treatment for purposes of the proposed settlement  such that all investors included in the proposed classes in these cases would be bound by the terms of the settlement unless an investor opted to be excluded from the settlement in a timely and appropriate fashion 
on december   the us court of appeals for the second circuit court of appeals issued a decision in in re initial public offering securities litigation that six purported class action lawsuits containing allegations substantially similar to those asserted against us could not be certified as class actions due  in part  to the court of appeals determination that individual issues of reliance and knowledge would predominate over issues common to the proposed classes 
on january   the plaintiffs filed a petition seeking rehearing en banc of this ruling 
on april  the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs petition for rehearing of the court of appeals december  ruling 
the court of appeals  however  noted that the plaintiffs remained free to ask the district court to certify classes different from the ones originally proposed which might meet the standards for class certification that the court of appeals articulated in its december  decision 
the plaintiffs have since moved for certification of different classes in the district court 
in light of the court of appeals december  decision regarding certification of the plaintiffs claims  the district court entered an order on june  terminating the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers  including us 
because any possible future settlement with the plaintiffs  if a settlement were ever to be negotiated and ultimately agreed to  would involve the certification of a class action for settlement purposes  the impact of the court of appeals rulings on the possible future settlement of the claims against us cannot now be predicted 
on october   the plaintiffs submitted their briefing in support of their motions to certify different classes in the six focus cases 
the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants filed separate oppositions to those motions on december  the motions to certify classes in the six focus cases are not yet fully briefed and remain pending 
in addition  on august   the plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases 
on november   the issuer defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases 
the underwriter defendants have also moved to dismiss the claims against them in the amended complaints in the six focus cases 
those motions to dismiss are not yet fully briefed and remain pending 
now that the proposed settlement has been terminated  we intend to continue to defend the litigation vigorously 
while we can make no promises or guarantees as to the outcome of these proceedings  we believe that the final result of this action will have no material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations statement refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the impact of the adoption of fin to our financial condition and results of operations was a charge of million  net of an income tax benefit of million  for the year ended december  diluted net income per common share for the years ended december   and are calculated by deducting dividends on our redeemable preferred stock of million  million  million and million  respectively  the accretion of the increase in redemption value of our redeemable preferred stock of million in  million in and million in  the dividend from inducement shares issued upon conversion of convertible redeemable preferred stock of million in  the allocation of undistributed earnings to preferred shareholders of million in  and the accretion of the beneficial conversion feature on redeemable preferred stock of million in from net income loss for such periods and then dividing the resulting amounts by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and conversion of preferred stock to the extent they are not anti dilutive during such periods

table of contents industry overview worldwide semiconductor industry sales were billion in  an increase of from billion in we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the total market in the areas we provide semiconductor components 
the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our total addressable market since year ended december  worldwide semiconductor industry sales percent change total addressable market sales percent change in billions in billions based on shipment information published by wsts  an industry research firm 
wsts collects this information based on product shipments  which is different from our revenue recognition policy as described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition contained elsewhere in this report 
we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable  but we have not independently verified it 
wsts periodically revises its information 
we assume no obligation to update such information 
our total addressable market comprises the following specific wsts product categories a discrete products all discrete semiconductors other than sensors  rf and microwave power transistors modules  rf and microwave diodes  rf and microwave ss transistors  power fet modules  igbt modules and optoelectronics  b standard analog products amplifiers  voltage regulators and references  comparators  assp consumer  assp computer  assp automotive and assp industrial and others  and c standard logic products general purpose logic and mos general purpose logic only 
although we categorize our products as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components  wsts uses different product categories 
following the unprecedented semiconductor industry revenue declines of  the semiconductor industry began to show signs of stability in and grew more robust in both and worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew by in  in  and in sales in our total addressable market grew by in and in  reflecting increases in volume and slowing rates of price declines 
sales in our total addressable market remained stable in  reflecting increases in volume that were offset by price declines 
sales in our total addressable market grew in  reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact of further price declines 
sales in our total addressable market grew in  reflecting increases in volume that exceeded the impact further declines 
the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our total addressable market of approximately during through these are projections and may not be indicative of actual results 
recent results our total revenues for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of percent from  million for the year ended december  during  we reported net income of million that included a restructuring  asset impairment and other charges of million 
during  we reported net income of million that included million in restructuring  asset impairments and other benefits 
our gross margin decreased by approximately basis points to in from in the primary reason for the decrease is attributable to the lower gross margin associated with manufacturing services revenue in versus 
table of contents outlook based upon booking trends  backlog levels  anticipated manufacturing services revenue and estimated turns levels  we anticipate that total revenues will be down approximately to in the first quarter of as compared to total revenues of million in the fourth quarter of backlog levels at the beginning of the first quarter of were down from backlog levels at the beginning of the fourth quarter of and represent over of our anticipated first quarter revenues 
we expect that average selling prices for the first quarter of will be down approximately one percent sequentially 
we expect our total gross margin in the first quarter of to be approximately to and our product gross margin to be approximately to 
we expect the purchase accounting rules associated with our recent acquisition of the cpu voltage and pc thermal products group from analog devices  inc will negatively impact our total gross margins by approximately basis points in the first quarter of this impact is already included in our gross margin guidance 
we currently expect our stock based compensation expense to be approximately million in the first quarter of and amortization of intangibles associated with the cpu voltage and thermal products group to be approximately million in the first quarter of for the first quarter of  we expect selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses at approximately of revenues and research and development expenses at approximately of revenues 
we anticipate that net interest expense and income tax provision will be approximately million and million  respectively  for the first quarter of we anticipate cash capital expenditures will be approximately million in the first quarter of and total cash capital expenditures of approximately million to million for the year ended december  business overview we classify our products broadly as power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components 
we design  manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products 
our power management semiconductor components control  convert  protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices 
our data management semiconductor components provide high performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems 
our standard semiconductor components serve as building block components within virtually all electronic devices 
these various products fall into the logic  analog and discrete categories used by wsts 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical 
during a down cycle  unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem  resulting in revenue declines 
in response to such declines  manufacturers have shut down production capacity 
when new applications or other factors have eventually caused demand to strengthen  production volumes have eventually stabilized and then grown again 
as market unit demand have reached levels above capacity production capabilities  shortages have begun to occur  which typically has caused pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers  thus prompting further capacity expansion 
such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand  which has triggered another similar cycle 
during we experienced an increase in the end market demand  mostly offset by price decreases  which resulted in slightly increased revenue compared to the previous year 
we expect price declines during to be moderate and we will continue to monitor the supply and demand picture to determine if pricing could be held or increased 
new product innovation as a result of the success of our research and development initiatives  excluding the introduction of lead free products  we introduced new product families in and new product families in our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in power management that appeal to 
table of contents customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications 
in light of the recent acquisition of the gresham  oregon wafer fabrication facility  we are increasing our research and development in deep sub micron power management solutions to further differentiate us from our competition 
as always  it is our practice to regularly re evaluate our research and development spending  to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies regularly 
we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position us for continued growth 
as a result  we often invest opportunistically to refresh existing products in our commodity logic  analog  and discrete products 
we invest in these initiatives when we believe there is a strong customer demand or opportunities to innovate our current portfolio in high growth markets and applications 
cost savings and restructuring activities we continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure and  as a result  we expect to rank  as compared to our primary competitors  among the lowest in terms of cost structure 
during the first quarter of  we announced plans to consolidate manufacturing efforts with the closing of one of our manufacturing facilities at our phoenix  arizona location 
the wafer manufacturing that takes place at this facility is being transferred to our off shore low cost manufacturing facilities  and we expect this transfer to be completed during the last two fiscal quarters of after we have completed the transfer to other facilities  we plan to exit the manufacturing facility at our phoenix location  which is currently under agreement to be sold 
it is anticipated that approximately employees will be terminated as a result of this consolidation effort  in addition to approximately positions that will be eliminated through normal attrition 
we expect the full annual cost savings from this consolidation to be at least million to million beginning in the fourth quarter of also in connection with this activity  during the third quarter of we announced reductions in factory support functions at our phoenix  arizona and gresham  oregon locations which resulted in the elimination or transfer of positions 
we expect the full annual cost savings from this announcement to be approximately million beginning in the fourth quarter of although we have production at several locations  we have initiated process improvements and selective capital acquisitions that we expect will increase our overall capacity 
our profitability enhancement programs will continue to focus on consolidating manufacturing sites to improve economies of scale  transferring production to lower cost regions  increasing die manufacturing capacity in a cost effective manner by moving production from to and wafers and increasing the number of die per square inch  reducing the number of product platforms and process flows  and focusing production on profitable product families 
debt reduction and financing activities since the recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
during and  we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions  which extended a portion of our debt maturities 
since  however  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt and related interest costs 
as a result of these measures  we reduced our total debt from  million as of december  to  million as of december  similarly  we have reduced our annual interest expense from million in to million in also  see liquidity and capital resources and note long term debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k

the merger agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies  and is expected to be completed as soon as practicable after special meetings of shareholders of both us and amis scheduled for march  consummation of the merger is subject to several closing conditions  including shareholder approval by both companies 
at the effective time of the merger  each issued and outstanding share of common stock of amis will be converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock  which had an estimated value of million when the merger was announced on december  contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements 
some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to intellectual property infringement  property damage including environmental contamination  personal injury  failure to comply with applicable laws  our negligence or willful misconduct  or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets 
we are a party to various agreements with motorola  a former affiliate  which were entered into in connection with our separation from motorola 
pursuant to these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify motorola for losses due to  for example  breach of representations and warranties and covenants  damages arising from assumed liabilities or relating to allocated assets  and for specified environmental matters 
our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and payment by us is conditioned on motorola making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract  which procedures typically allow us to challenge motorola s claims 
we face risks of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in their recall 
in one particular case  we have agreed to indemnify a major customer for valid warranty claims on our products sold  not to exceed two and one half times the total annual sales

we maintain directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in addition to the above  from time to time we provide standard representations and warranties to counterparties in contracts in connection with sales of our securities and the engagement of financial advisors and also provide indemnities that protect the counterparties to these contracts in the event they suffer damages as a result of a breach of such representations and warranties or in certain other circumstances relating to the sale of securities or their engagement by us 
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification  other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements  including outlays for research and development  to make capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances 
in the near term  we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and targeted asset sales 
additionally  as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis 
in this regard  we currently have a pending merger with amis 
if the proposed merger with amis is completed  we will be required to repay or refinance all of amis s outstanding debt concurrent with the completion of the merger 
as of september   the aggregate principal amount of amis s outstanding debt was approximately million 
we expect to refinance all or a portion of amis s outstanding debt with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from one or multiple financing transactions  including pursuant to the accordion feature of our existing senior bank credit facility  factoring arrangements  sale leaseback transactions  sale of assets  cash generated from operations and additional debt financing  which we are currently exploring but for which we do not have contractual commitments 
although the total dollar amount of this refinancing could be significant  we do not believe that it will impair the ability of our combined businesses to maintain sufficient working capital 
we believe that we will be able to successfully complete the repayment or refinancing of amis s outstanding debt  although due to prevailing market conditions  such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us 
in addition  on an on going basis  amis will affect our internal cash utilization and capital expenditures  as well as our liquidity 
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows  including changes in demand for our products  competitive pricing pressures  effective management of our manufacturing capacity  our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses  the impact of our restructuring programs on our productivity and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business  and 
table of contents factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise  including interest rate fluctuations  our ability to maintain compliance with financial covenants under our existing credit facilities and other limitations imposed by our credit facilities or arising from our substantial leverage 
our ability to service our long term debt  to remain in compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and to fund working capital  capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to  among other things  our future operating performance as well as to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  some of which may beyond our control 
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives 
there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or  if available  will be at rates or prices acceptable to us 
we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements through december  to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
operations our operational cash flows are affected by the ability of our operations to generate cash  and our management of our assets and liabilities  including both working capital and long term assets and liabilities 
each of these components is discussed herein 
table of contents ebitda earnings net income before interest expense  interest income  provisions for income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda is a key indicator that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and cash flows 
not all of these items listed above are necessarily included in the calculation of net income each quarter 
while ebitda is a non gaap measure and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity  we believe this measure provides important supplemental information to investors and is useful to investors to  among other things  assess our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
we use this measure  together with gaap measures  for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate period to period comparisons 
however  we do not  and you should not  rely on non gaap financial measures alone as measures of our performance 
we believe that non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when taken together with gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures that we also provide in our reports provide a more complete understanding of factors and treands affecting our business 
this calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth our ebitda for the years ended december   and  with a reconciliation to cash flows from operations  the most directly comparable financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles in millions december  december  december  net income increase decrease depreciation and amortization interest expense interest income income tax provision ebitda increase decrease interest expense interest income income tax provision loss gain on sale or disposal of fixed assets proceeds  net of gain  from termination of interest rate swaps gain on property insurance settlement non cash portion of loss on debt prepayment amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount provision for excess inventories cumulative effect of accounting change non cash impairment write down of property  plant and equipment non cash interest on junior subordinated note payable to motorola deferred income taxes stock compensation expense other changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities as a result of the improved operating performance we generated positive ebitda for  and ebitda for decreased to million largely due to the lower net income of million for the year 
ebitda for increased to million largely due to the generation of net income of million for the year 

table of contents as discussed in note  long term debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  our debt covenants require us to stay within certain leverage ratios based on the consolidated ebitda for the last four quarters 
consolidated ebitda  as defined under the documents for our senior bank facilities totaled approximately million for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended december  this consolidated ebitda computation excludes certain restructuring and other charges and contains other differences from the ebitda as defined above 
therefore  ebitda in the above table is not representative of the consolidated ebitda used to determine our debt covenant compliance 
if we were not in compliance with the covenants contained in our senior bank facilities  the holders of our senior bank facilities could cause all outstanding amounts  which was million as of december  to be due and payable immediately 
if we were unable to repay  refinance or restructure that indebtedness  the holders could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  any such event of default or declaration of acceleration could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
as of december  approximately million remained outstanding under other debt that may be accelerated based on this covenant 
therefore  the credit agreement for our senior bank facilities is a material agreement 
working capital working capital fluctuates depending on end market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables  inventory and payables 
in times of escalating demand  our working capital requirements may increase as we purchase additional manufacturing inputs and increase production 
our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs  which may require us to use cash for severance payments  asset transfers and contract termination costs 
our working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was million at december   and has fluctuated between million and million over the last eight quarter ends 
the components of our working capital at december  and are set forth below in millions  followed by explanations for changes between and for cash  and cash equivalents and any other changes greater than million december  change current assets cash and cash equivalents receivables  net inventories  net other current assets deferred income taxes total current assets current liabilities accounts payable accrued expenses income taxes payable accrued interest deferred income on sales to distributors current portion of long term debt total current liabilities net working capital 
table of contents the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in was attributable to cash flow from operations of approximately million  partially offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million see key financing events below 
the increase of million in inventory is attributable to finished goods inventory acquired from the adi acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of the increase of million in other current assets is primarily attributable to the prepaid supply contract associated with the adi acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of the decrease in accrued expenses of million was primarily attributable to the decreases in accrued employee performance bonuses  accrued payroll and accrued vacation 
long term assets and liabilities our long term assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  foreign tax receivables and capitalized debt issuance costs 
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently 
we believe that near term access to additional manufacturing capacity  should it be required  could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we will continue to look for opportunities to make similar strategic purchases in the future as we plan to invest in for additional capacity 
although our debt covenants contain certain restrictions that limit our amount of future capital expenditures  we do not believe that these restrictions will have a significant impact on our future operating performance 
our long term liabilities  excluding long term debt  consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and tax reserves 
in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans  generally  our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate 
this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions

key financing events overview since we became an independent company as a result of our recapitalization  we have had relatively high levels of long term debt as compared to our principal competitors 
our long term debt includes amounts outstanding under our senior bank facilities  which contain covenants with which we were in compliance as of december  during the second half of  we began undertaking measures to reduce our long term debt  reduce related interest costs and  in some cases  extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility 
these measures have continued in set forth below is a summary of the key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years 
november conversion of redeemable preferred stock on november   we entered into a conversion and termination agreement with an affiliate of tpg to convert our outstanding convertible redeemable preferred stock held by such affiliate  with a book value of million and million as of september  and december   respectively  into 
table of contents  shares of our common stock 
we issued an additional  shares of common stock to the tpg affiliate to induce the conversion of the preferred stock 
following the conversion  none of the authorized shares of the preferred stock remained outstanding 
in connection with the conversion and inducement  we recognized a million charge that reduced net income applicable to common stock for a deemed dividend from the issuance of inducement shares issued upon conversion 
december repayment of junior subordinated notes and issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes as part of the recapitalization  semiconductor components industries  llc  our primary domestic operating subsidiary  issued a million junior subordinated note due during periods it was outstanding  the note bore interest at an annual rate of  compounded semi annually and payable at maturity 
the note was junior in right of payment to all senior debt 
in november  we repaid million of the junior subordinated note with cash on hand  which reduced the outstanding principal amount to approximately million 
in order to finance the repayment of the remaining principal amount of the junior subordinated note  in december we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes after deducting commissions and estimated offering expenses of million  which were capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest method through the first put date of december  the notes bear interest at the rate of per year from the date of issuance 
interest on the notes is payable on june and december of each year  beginning on june  the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible by holders into cash and shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment in certain events  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
we will settle conversion of all notes validly tendered for conversion in cash and shares of our common stock  if applicable  subject to our right to pay the share amount in additional cash 
holders may convert their notes under the following circumstances i during the five business day period immediately following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate  ii upon occurrence of the specified transactions described in the indenture relating to the notes  or iii after june  we determined that the conversion option based on a trading price condition meets the definition of a derivative  and should be bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for separately

february amendment to senior bank facilities in february  we refinanced the term loans under our senior bank facilities to reduce the interest rate from libor plus to libor plus

accounting changes asset retirement obligations 
effective december  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no

table of contents the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded a million net charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change in  and we recorded a million liability for asset retirement obligations  included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized approximately an million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january   balance of retained earnings 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in millions balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions for tax positions of prior years lapse of statute settlements balance at december  the entire december  balance of approximately million relates to unrecognized tax positions that  if recognized  would affect the annual effective tax rate

note significant accounting policies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report contains a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations 
we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue 
we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to original equipment manufacturers  electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors 
we also generate revenue  although to a much lesser extent from manufacturing services provided to customers 
we recognize revenue on sales to original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers and sales of manufacturing services net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title to products sold to distributors typically passes at the time of shipment by us so we record accounts receivable for the amount of the transaction  reduce our inventory for the products shipped and defer the related margin in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when the distributor informs us that they have resold the products to the end user 
as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors  we defer the related revenue and margin on sales to distributors 
although payment terms vary  most distributor agreements require payment within days 
taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions  including value added and excise taxes  are presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the statement of operations 
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience 
our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty 
sales to distributors  however  are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow moving products 
under our general agreements  distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book 
in addition  agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
however  since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product  due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors  sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  estimated returns and allowances  and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized  and are netted against revenues 
given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar products  our actual returns and allowances and warranty claims have not traditionally fluctuated significantly from period to period  and our returns and allowances and warranty provisions have historically been reasonably accurate 
we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will  at the time of shipment  be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications 
our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of i three years from the date of shipment or ii the period of time specified in the customer s standard warranty provided that the customer s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
in addition  we also offer cash discounts to customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time  generally days after shipment 
we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues  based on experience with each customer 

table of contents freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred 
inventories 
we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market and record provisions for slow moving inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end user demand 
these provisions can influence our results from operations 
for example  when demand falls for a given part  all or a portion of the related inventory is reserved  impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit 
if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold  we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin 
however  the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded 
although we do sell some products that have previously been written down  such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
in the fourth quarter of  a valuation allowance was established for our domestic deferred tax assets and a portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
additionally  throughout  and  no incremental domestic deferred tax benefits were recognized 
as of december  and  gross deferred tax assets were million and million  respectively  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance are monitored on an ongoing basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results 
we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset 
the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests 
in recent years  most of our assets that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned  sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities 
in some instances  these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value 
when material  these gains are recorded in the restructuring  asset impairment and other  net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
goodwill 
we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit containing our goodwill with the related carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
to date  our goodwill has not been considered to be impaired based on the results of this first step 
defined benefit plans 
we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  
table of contents including a discount rate for plan obligations  assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increase for plan employees 
all of these assumptions are based upon management s judgment  considering all known trends and uncertainties 
actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans 
for example  as of december   a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately million 
valuation of stock compensation 
the fair value of each option grant in and thereafter is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice based option valuation model 
in past years  the company has used the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of its options 
the lattice based model uses a constant volatility  an employee exercise behavior model based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior  and the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of each option grant 
the company continues to use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan 
asset retirement obligations 
we recognize asset retirement obligations aros when incurred  with the initial measurement at fair value 
these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income 
in addition  asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related asset s carrying value and are depreciated over the asset s respective useful life 
our aros consist primarily of estimated decontamination costs associated with manufacturing equipment and buildings 
contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on the available information  we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable 
sfas no 
also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measures on earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   although early adoption is permitted 
our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas no 
permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
entities electing the fair value option are required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption 
our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces fas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business 
table of contents combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after an entity s fiscal year that begins after december  we will assess the impact of sfas r if and when a future acquisition occurs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains it controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled  million 
we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt  which totaled million 
we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
however  some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents as a result of the higher rates 
our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement has a provision for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility becomes less than million 
a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a multinational business  we also conduct certain of these activities through transactions denominated in a variety of other currencies 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge firm commitments and reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on our results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 
this strategy reduces  but does not eliminate  the short term impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
for example  changes in exchange rates may affect the foreign currency sales price of our products and can lead to increases or decreases in sales volume to the extent that the sales price of comparable products of our competitors are less or more than the sales price of our products 
our policy prohibits speculation on financial instruments  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure
