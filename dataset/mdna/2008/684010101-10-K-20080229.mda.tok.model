liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  almost all of our funds generated from operations are generated by our operating subsidiaries 
we access these funds through receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of various regulatory bodies including the sec  finra  cboe  cftc and nfa relating to liquidity and capital standards  which limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the holding company 
we invest company cash in a variety of high credit quality  short duration investment vehicles including us government treasury bills  bank issued commercial paper  aaa rated institutional money market funds and auction rate certificates arcs backed by us government guaranteed student loans issued under the federal family education loan program 
all of our arcs carry aaa credit ratings 
interest rates on arcs are reset approximately once each month by dutch auction 
recent disruptions in the credit markets have causes some of these auctions to fail  which can constrain the liquidity of our arcs 
despite these constraints  there have been no defaults in our arcs or any other arcs of similar collateral  and all of these securities remain current in interest payments 
in general  we believe all of our investments are of high credit quality and we have more than adequate liquidity to conduct our businesses

as of december   we had million of cash segregated in compliance with federal regulations in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of customers under rule c of the securities exchange act of and other regulations 
liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in customer brokerage accounts  which were million on december  credit facility we have historically financed our operating liquidity and capital needs primarily through the use of funds generated from operations and the issuance of common stock 
to support our self clearing activities  in june  we established an unsecured  uncommitted credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na 
any outstanding balances on this credit facility would be callable on demand 
we anticipate that the credit facility will only be used occasionally  addressing potential timing issues with the flow of customer funds  and will only be used to facilitate transactions for which customers already have sufficient funds in brokerage accounts 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding on this credit facility 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into secured or additional unsecured lines of credit from time to time 
cash flow cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities decreased despite a increase in net income in compared to the primary reasons for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were the smaller increases in payables to brokerage customers and segregated cash and receivables from brokerage customers

the increase in capital expenditures was related to an increased level of capitalized software development and the investment required to prepare our new corporate headquarters for occupancy 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  there are certain customer activities that may result in contingencies that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities may expose us to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations 
many of our customer accounts are margin accounts 
in margin transactions  we may be obligated for credit extended to 
table of contents our customers by our clearing firms and subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
see risk factors we are subject to various forms of credit risk  and those risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial situation for a more detailed discussion of this risks associated with these arrangements 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  since the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligations 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of our future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion regarding income taxes 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the accounting policy that has a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment relates to the capitalization of software development 
software costs associated with software developed for internal use include capitalized costs based on sop and other related guidance 
capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll for employees directly associated with  and who devote time to  the development of the internal use software 
costs incurred in development and enhancement of the software that does not meet the capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred 
these capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
during the years ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of software development costs 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we expensed million and million for costs associated with software that did not meet the capitalization criteria 

table of contents the critical estimate related to this process is the determination of the amount of time devoted by employees to specific stages of internal use software development projects 
we utilize a project management tool to assist in validating the underlying estimates used in the determination of time devoted 
we periodically review the capitalized costs for impairment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we do not have material exposure to commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuations or similar market risks other than the effect they may have on trading volumes 
accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative contracts to mitigate such risks 
interest rate risk as a self clearing broker dealer  we hold interest earning assets  mainly customer funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities in the form of customer cash balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the customer balances  as well as on the difference between amounts earned on customer margin loans and amounts paid on customer cash balances 
since we set the rate paid on customer cash balances and the rate charged on customer margin loans  we are able to manage a substantial portion of our interest rate risk 
however  a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread while a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread 
we estimate that as of 
table of contents december   an immediate basis point increase or decrease in short term interest rates would result in approximately million more or less annual pre tax income  respectively 
changes in interest rates also affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
to reduce this interest rate risk  our current investments have short term maturities 
credit risk we extend margin credit and leverage to our customers  which are subject to various regulatory and clearing firm margin requirements 
margin credit balances are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
leverage involves securing a large potential future obligation with a lesser amount of cash or securities 
the risks associated with margin credit and leverage increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where leverage or collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit or leverage and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of liquidation 
we are exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities or futures transactions that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
at december   we had million in credit extended to our customers 
in addition  we may be obligated for margin extended to our customers by our third party clearing agents on collateralized securities and futures positions 
the margin and leverage requirements that we impose on our customer accounts meet or exceed those required by various regulatory requirements and regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
the amount of this risk is not quantifiable since the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
as a result  we are exposed to significant off balance sheet credit risk in the event customer collateral is not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur 
in the event customers fail to satisfy their obligations  we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customers obligations 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements  and no liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we borrow securities temporarily from other broker dealers in connection with our broker dealer business 
we deposit cash as collateral for the securities borrowed 
decreases in securities prices may cause the market value of the securities borrowed to fall below the amount of cash deposited as collateral 
in the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the cash deposited  we may be exposed to the risk of selling the securities at prevailing market prices 
we seek to manage this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties  by monitoring the securities values on a daily basis  and by requiring additional collateral as needed
