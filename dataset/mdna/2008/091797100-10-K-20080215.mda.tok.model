item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global manufacturer and marketer of power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement products  and technology based fastening systems 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems with these business segments comprising approximately   and  respectively  of the corporation s sales in as more fully disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on march   the corporation acquired vector 
vector  a designer and marketer of consumer portable power products  is included in the power tools and accessories segment 
the corporation markets its products and services in over countries 
during  approximately   and of its sales were made to customers in the united states  in europe including the united kingdom and middle east  and in other geographic regions  respectively 
the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments are subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which they operate as well as the strength of the retail economies 
the fastening and assembly systems segment is also subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which it operates as well as to automotive and industrial demand 
an overview of certain aspects of the corporation s performance during the year ended december   follows sales for were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
while the effects of a weaker us dollar as compared to most other currencies caused a increase in consolidated sales during  that increase was partially offset by a decline in unit volume 
that unit volume decline was driven by lower sales in the united states and was partially offset by higher sales outside of the united states 
sales to us customers in declined by from the level due  in part  to sharply lower housing starts 
the corporation expects that continued weakness in key sectors of the us economy  including lower residential construction  will contribute to a low single digit rate of sales decline in as compared to operating income as a percentage of sales for decreased by approximately basis points from the level to 
of that decline  approximately basis points was attributable to a reduction in gross margin  approximately basis points was attributable an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and approximately basis points was attributable to a million pre tax restructuring charge 
gross margin as a percentage of sales declined in as the effects of rising commodity costs together with the change in china s value added tax and appreciation of the chinese renminbi which  in the aggregate  increased cost of goods sold by approximately million over the level  were only partially offset by the favorable effects of productivity initiatives 
gross margin as a percentage of sales in was also negatively affected by a million pre tax charge associated with the recall of certain dewalt xrp cordless drills 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased in over the level due principally to  in the us  the de leveraging of expenses over a lower sales base and to higher corporate expenses  which included a million pre tax charge in for an environmental matter 
the corporation anticipates that operating income as a percentage of sales will approximate in the corporation expects that operating income in will be unfavorably impacted by the unfavorable effects of rising commodity costs together with the change in china s value added tax and appreciation of the chinese renminbi which  in the aggregate  are expected to approximate million of incremental inflation  and an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales associated with the de leveraging of expenses over a lower sales base 
however  the corporation believes that such unfavorability will be offset by the favorable effect of productivity and restructuring initiatives and from the lack of certain unfavorable items experienced in namely  the pre tax charges previously described relating to an environmental matter  the dewalt xrp recall  and restructuring and exit costs 
interest expense net of interest income rose by million in over the level  due principally to lower interest income associated with reduced levels of cash and cash equivalents 
net earnings were million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   as compared to million  or per diluted share  in net earnings for the year ended december   included the effects of the following three items i a million tax benefit resulting from a settlement agreement reached on an income tax litigation matter  ii an after tax charge of million million before taxes associated with an environmental remediation matter  and iii an after tax restructuring charge of million million before taxes 
cash flow from operating activities increased by million over the level to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to cash provided by working capital in  including the effect of lower income tax payments  as compared to cash used for working capital in under an ongoing share repurchase program  the corporation repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock during at a cost of million 
as a result of those repurchases  shares used in computing annual diluted earnings per share for declined by as compared to the preceding information is an overview of certain aspects of the corporation s performance during the year ended december   and should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety

that differentiation includes sales of businesses where year to year comparability exists in the category of existing or legacy businesses 
for example  in  the sales of vector are included in sales of acquired businesses 
results of operations sales the following chart provides an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume existing a unit volume acquired b price currency change in total sales a represents change in unit volume for businesses where year to year comparability exists  however  includes unit volume in of the european flex power tools business sold in november b represents change in unit volume for businesses that were acquired and were not included in prior period results 
total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
as compared to the level  unit volume declined by in that unit volume decline was driven by lower sales in the united states and was partially offset by higher sales outside of the united states 
sales to us customers in declined by from the level due  in part  to sharply lower housing starts 
the effect of pricing actions did not have a material effect on sales in while the corporation implemented price increases in late  the impact of those pricing increases in was mitigated by pricing and promotional actions undertaken to stimulate demand

total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a decrease from sales of  million 
excluding the incremental effects of the vector acquisition  unit volume declined by from the level 
that decline was driven by lower sales in the united states due  in part  to weak demand in the face of slowing residential construction and actions taken by certain major customers late in to reduce inventory levels 
vector  a consumer portable power business acquired on march   contributed to consolidated sales 
pricing actions had a negative impact on sales in  as compared to the effects of foreign currency did not have a material effect on sales in  as compared to earnings a summary of the corporation s consolidated gross margin  selling  general  and administrative expenses  and operating income all expressed as a percentage of sales follows year ended december  percentage of sales gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring and exit costs

however  those negative effects were partially offset by the favorable effects of productivity and restructuring initiatives  pricing actions  product mix  and currency 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by approximately basis points from the level to in that decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of significant commodity inflation  coupled with the negative effects both of pricing actions and of lower sales and production volumes over which to leverage fixed costs  which offset the positive effects that resulted from restructuring and productivity initiatives as well as favorable product mix 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately in and in both and consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses in increased by million over the level 
the effect of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately one third of that increase and the remainder was primarily attributable to additional selling  general  and administrative expenses to support increased sales in certain markets outside of the united states and to higher environmental expenses 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses in decreased by million from the level 
that decrease was due  in part  to declines in certain sales related expenses as a result of lower sales volume as well as in certain employee related expenses  including performance based incentive compensation  which offset incremental expenses of the acquired vector business and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
in  the corporation recognized million of pre tax restructuring and exit costs related to actions in its power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments 
the restructuring charge reflects actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base as well as selling  general  and administrative expenses in those segments 
consolidated net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in net interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily the result of lower interest income associated with reduced levels of cash and cash equivalents

sales in north america decreased at a mid single digit rate during as compared to the prior year s level 
sales of the corporation s industrial power tools and accessories business in the united states decreased at a mid single digit rate primarily as a result of lower sales of equipment due largely to lower sales of generators and compressors  construction tools  and woodworking tools 
the us industrial power tools and accessories business was adversely impacted by weak demand in the face of slowing residential construction and actions taken by certain major customers late in to reduce inventory levels 
sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business in the united states decreased at a low single digit rate primarily as a result of lower consumer power tool and pressure washer sales  which were partially offset by the sales of the acquired vector business 
excluding the sales of the acquired vector business  sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business declined at a double digit rate from the level with sales down across most channels and product lines 
actions taken by major retailers to reduce inventory levels also negatively impacted the us consumer power tools and accessories business in in canada  sales decreased at a low single digit rate  as a double digit rate of decline in sales of consumer power tools and accessories was partially offset by a mid single digit rate of increase in sales of industrial power tools and accessories 
sales of the european power tools and accessories business during increased at a low single digit rate over the level experienced in a mid single digit rate of increase in organic sales was partially offset by the sales decline that resulted from the divestiture of the flex business in late while sales grew in across most markets  marked growth was experienced in the middle east africa and eastern european regions

gross margin as a percentage of sales for declined in comparison to primarily due to negative pricing actions  lower sales and production volume over which to absorb fixed costs  and commodity inflation 
those negative factors were mitigated by the benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives as well as favorable mix 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for increased  as compared to  due principally to the de leveraging of fixed and semi fixed costs over a lower sales base 
hardware and home improvement segment sales and profit for the hardware and home improvement segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers  
 
 
segment profit 


sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment during decreased from the level 
sales of security hardware in the united states declined at a mid single digit rate due  in part  to the negative effects of the us housing slowdown  which were only partially offset by the introduction of the smart series of products at retail and by the effect of price increases instituted in late sales of plumbing products in the united states rose at a high single digit rate in  driven by growth in the retail channel due  in part  to increased listings  new product introductions  and price increases instituted in late sales of the hardware and home improvement segment outside of the united states rose at a double digit rate in over the level  driven by increased shelf space for the weiser lock business at two large canadian retailers

despite a double digit rate of decline in us housing starts in  sales of security hardware products approximated the level 
sales of kwikset products grew at a low single digit rate  as higher retail sales and the effects of a price increase during the fourth quarter of offset weakness in the wholesale channel 
that growth in kwikset sales offset a low single digit rate of decline in sales of weiser and baldwin products 
segment profit as a percentage of sales in the hardware and home improvement segment decreased from in to in the decline in segment profit as a percentage of sales in was attributable to a decline in gross margin  as the favorable effects of restructuring integration and productivity initiatives  coupled with price increases instituted by the segment  were insufficient to offset the negative effects of significant commodity inflation  particularly with respect to copper and zinc  and lower sales and production volumes 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in  as compared to  as a result of cost reduction initiatives 
fastening and assembly systems segment sales and profit for the fastening and assembly systems segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers

sales in the european industrial business rose at a low single digit rate while sales in the european automotive business approximated the prior year level 
in asia  sales grew at a double digit rate  reflecting strong sales in both japan and china 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment increased slightly from in to in the segment reduced selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  despite higher research and development expenditures  due to spending controls in however  that favorability was offset by a decline in gross margin  primarily as a result of commodity inflation and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency 
other segment related matters as indicated in the first table of note of notes to consolidated financial statements  segment profit loss  associated with corporate  adjustments  and eliminations corporate was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
corporate expenses for increased over the prior year s level due to the unfavorable effects of higher legal and environmental expenses due to the million charge taken for an environmental remediation matter  a foreign currency loss by a corporate subsidiary that offset a foreign currency gain by that subsidiary in  and higher expenses associated with intercompany eliminations  principally related to foreign currency effects 
those unfavorable effects were partially offset by the favorable effects of income booked by corporate for the reportable business segments  including the reversal of certain performance based incentive expenses included in segment profit of the reportable business segments 
corporate expenses for declined from the prior year s level as the positive effects of certain lower employee related expenses not allocated directly to the reportable business segments including performance based incentives and a foreign currency gain by a corporate subsidiary  as well as higher corporate expense allocations charged directly to the corporation s business segments  were partially offset by the negative effects of higher pension and environmental expenses 
expense recognized by the corporation in  on a consolidated basis  relating to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans decreased by approximately million from the level 
expense recognized by the corporation in  on a consolidated basis  relating to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans increased by approximately million over the level

the million decrease in that corporate adjustment in  as compared to  resulted from the lower level of pension and other postretirement benefit expenses excluding service costs allocated to the reportable business segments 
the million increase in that corporate adjustment in  as compared to  resulted from the higher level of pension and other postretirement benefit expenses excluding service costs allocated to the reportable business segments 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the only element of pension and other postretirement benefits expense included in the determination of segment profit of the corporation s reportable business segments is service costs 
income expenses directly related to reportable business segments booked in consolidation  and  thus  excluded from segment profit for the reportable business segments  were million  
million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million of segment related income excluded from segment profit in principally related to the power tools and accessories segment as well as to the reversal of certain performance based incentive expenses included in the allocation of corporate expenses to each of the reportable business segments 
the 
million of segment related expense excluded from segment profit in consisted of an increase in reserves for certain matters associated with the power tools and accessories segment that was substantially offset by the reversal of certain performance based incentive expenses included in the allocation of corporate expenses to each of the reportable business segments 
the million of segment related income excluded from segment profit in principally related to a reduction in reserves for certain legal matters associated with the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments 
as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the determination of segment profit excludes restructuring and exit costs 
of the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in  million and million related to the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments  respectively 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the european security hardware business  consisting of the nemef  corbin  and dom businesses  has been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
as such  the operating results  assets and liabilities  and cash flows of the discontinued european security hardware business have been reported separately from the corporation s continuing operations 
in november  the corporation completed the sale of the dom security hardware business for an aggregate price of million  net of cash transferred 
the net loss of the discontinued european security hardware business was 
million for the year ended december  restructuring and integration actions the corporation is committed to continuous productivity improvement and continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce fixed costs  simplify or improve processes  and eliminate excess capacity 
a tabular summary of restructuring activity during the three years ended december   is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the corporation recognized million of pre tax restructuring and exit costs related to actions taken in its power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments 
the restructuring charge reflects actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base as well as selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the restructuring actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the power tools and accessories segment includes the closure of a manufacturing facility  with production from that facility to be either transferred to other facilities or outsourced from third party suppliers 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the hardware and home improvement segment primarily relate to optimization of its north american finishing operations  including the transfer of most finishing operations to a single facility 
the principal component of the restructuring charge related to the elimination of manufacturing and selling  general  and administrative positions 
a severance benefits accrual of million was recognized associated with the elimination of approximately positions 
the corporation estimates that  as a result of increases in manufacturing employee headcount in other facilities  approximately replacement positions will be filled  yielding a net total of approximately positions eliminated as a result of the restructuring actions 
the restructuring and exit costs also include a million write down to fair value of certain long lived assets of the hardware and home improvement segment that have been idled and will be either sold or scrapped 
the million restructuring charge taken in was net of a million gain  representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of the manufacturing facility to be closed under the restructuring plan over its carrying value 
during  the corporation substantially completed the execution of the restructuring plan that was formulated in the fourth quarter of and the closure of a manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment 
in addition to the recognition of restructuring and exit costs  the corporation also recognized related expenses  incremental to the cost of the underlying restructuring actions  that do not qualify as restructuring or exit costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states restructuring related expenses 
those restructuring related expenses included items directly related to the underlying restructuring actions that benefited on going operations  such as costs associated with the transfer of equipment 
operating results included approximately million of restructuring related expenses for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million and million of restructuring related expenses for and  respectively 
the corporation realized benefits of approximately million and million in and  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
those benefits resulted in a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the corporation expects that pre tax savings associated with the restructuring actions will benefit results by million  net of restructuring related expenses 
in addition to the previously discussed restructuring actions  the corporation also identified opportunities to integrate businesses it acquired  including the porter cable and delta tools group 
prior to the date of the acquisition of the porter cable and delta tools group and during  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure  as well as to integrate  these businesses into its power tools and accessories segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring integration actions relating to the acquired business in the amount of million 
these actions principally reflected severance costs associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of three manufacturing facilities  and lease and other contractual obligations for which no future benefit would be realized 
certain of these restructuring integration actions commenced in and the remainder commenced in  all actions were substantially completed in the corporation realized integration benefits associated with these actions of approximately million and million in and  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
principally all of those incremental pre tax savings benefited gross margin 
ultimate savings realized from restructuring integration actions may be mitigated by such factors as economic weakness and competitive pressures  as well as decisions to increase costs in areas such as promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed 
hedging activities the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  australian dollar  mexican peso  czech koruna  and brazilian real 
through its foreign currency activities  the corporation seeks to reduce the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of products manufactured in a currency different from that of the selling subsidiary will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
from time to time  currencies may strengthen or weaken in countries in which the corporation sells or manufactures its product 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impact of any future currency movements  there is no assurance that such movements will not adversely affect the corporation 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside of the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
during and  translation adjustments  recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity  increased stockholders equity by million and million  respectively 
the materials used in the manufacturing of the corporation s products  which include certain components and raw materials  are subject to price volatility 
these component parts and raw materials are principally subject to market risk associated with changes in the price of nickel  steel  resins  copper  aluminum  and zinc 
the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market  and the majority is available through multiple sources 
rising commodity costs including the impact of the change in china s value added tax and the appreciation of the chinese renminbi  which increase the costs of finished products and components manufactured in or purchased from third parties in china decreased operating income in by approximately million from the level and are expected to decrease operating income by approximately million in from the level 
while future movements in prices of raw materials and component parts are uncertain  the corporation uses a variety of methods  including established supply arrangements  purchase of component parts and raw materials for future delivery  and supplier price commitments  to address this risk 
in addition  the corporation utilizes derivatives to manage its risk to changes in the prices of certain commodities 
as of december   the amount outstanding under commodity hedges was not material 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may elect to manage its interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair value of its indebtedness  or the cash flows of its indebtedness  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   as compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years  as compared to years at december   and years at december  at both december  and  average long term debt maturity was years  as compared to years at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information as of december   about the corporation s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps 
weighted average variable rates are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of the reset dates 
the cash flows of these instruments are denominated in a variety of currencies 
unless otherwise indicated  the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the corporation s reporting currency  as of december  principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity dates us dollars in millions thereafter total fair value assets liabilities liabilities short term borrowings variable rate us dollar and other currencies a average interest rate long term debt fixed rate us dollars 

average interest rate interest rate derivatives fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps us dollars average pay rate b average receive rate a b short term borrowings of million include million and million that are denominated in us dollars and other currencies  respectively 
the average pay rate for swaps in the notional principal amount of million is based upon month forward libor with swaps in the notional principal amounts of million maturing in and million maturing thereafter 
the average pay rate for the remaining swap is based upon month forward libor 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity as discussed previously  the corporation is exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the corporation has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts 
the corporation estimated the effect on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform strengthening in the value of the united states dollar 
the corporation estimated that this would have the effects of reducing gross profits for by approximately million 
the corporation also estimated the effects on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar would have the effect of increasing gross profits 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect higher exchange rates  as compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december  critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements

pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rates of salary increase  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each year 
the corporation considers current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions

the corporation s discount rate for united states defined benefit pension plans was and at december  and  respectively 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns

the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets referred to as the market related value of assets 
the corporation s aggregate fair value of plan assets exceeded the market related value of assets by approximately million as of the measurement date 
differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market related value on a straight line basis over a five year period 
also  gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and from differences between assumptions and actual experience except those differences being amortized to the market related value of assets are amortized over the expected remaining service period of active plan participants or  for retired participants  the average remaining life expectancy  to the extent that such amounts exceed ten percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefit costs in will decrease by approximately million from the level

the second requirement of sfas no

as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not probable 
further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized
