financial statement overview during  we were able to effectively manage our business to improve financial performance in several of our key financial performance categories as indicated in the highlights presented below in september  we completed our acquisition of the misys computerized patient record cpr assets of misys healthcare  a division of misys plc ftse msy 
l at a purchase price of million in cash 
misys cpr  an award winning clinical information system  has been initially renamed qcpr 
the product immediately strengthens our capacity to serve our clients and to compete for clinical information systems business in large hospitals and multi facility engagements 
as a leader in access and identity management  health information management and revenue cycle management solutions  the addition of qcpr significantly improves the care management component of our care based revenue cycle strategy 
as a result of this acquisition  our results are not comparable with prior years 
total revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to a million hardware sale to a single customer and the million revenue in the fourth quarter resulting from the acquisition of the cpr business 
cash and investments decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the strategic decision to purchase the cpr business for million in cash prior to the closing of that deal  we had approximately million of cash and investments 
cash provided by operating activities of million in  compared to million in  was offset in part by million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment  million in net sales related to investment activity to fund the cpr business acquisition  and million of net cash used in financing activities  principally for the payment of preferred stock dividends and the repurchase of treasury shares 
days sales outstanding dso at december  was days compared to days at december  the receivables balance at year end reflects the addition of the cpr business receivables acquired which historically have experienced a higher dso than the quadramed standard  and which represented approximately four days of the dso 
the acquisition occurred at the end of the third quarter which did not allow sufficient time to apply our same collection discipline and bring the dso in line with quadramed standards by december  in addition  due to budgetary and other considerations with the veterans administration  we had million of past due receivables at december   all of which were paid during the first week of january  these past due amounts represented approximately eight days of the dso 
absent the effects of the cpr acquisition and the va issues  proforma dso would have been days compared to days at december  we are reporting income before income taxes of million in compared to million in as a result of the company s profitability in and  among other factors  we have reduced a significant portion of the valuation allowance that we have been carrying against our deferred tax assets  which has resulted in a one time deferred tax benefit in of million 
as a result  we expect to record income tax expense for accounting purposes in the future  corresponding to any income before income taxes that we report in those future periods 
recent events we provided high level financial guidance at the february ubs global healthcare services conference in new york 
as presented at the conference by keith hagen  quadramed s ceo and president  our revenues are anticipated to be in the range of million to million  representing approximately year on year top line growth which is in line with the growth rates of our enterprise competitors 
mr 
hagen also stated that he expects adjusted ebitda margin to be in the low double digits for  which is consistent with our reported financial performance in on february  we announced a strategic initiative to increase overall product development capacity and to further accelerate delivery of our care based revenue cycle product strategy to the healthcare market 
in an effort to provide high quality  feature rich products to our clients in the least amount of time we have re allocated financial and personnel resources to expand our product development capacity  and have partnered with tata consultancy services to assist us with quality assurance  technical publications and software programming 
this initiative will supplement the efforts of our existing dedicated product development team 
as a result  our overall development team will increase by with most of that increase focused on developing new products and new features 
related to this capacity expansion and resource re allocation initiative  we eliminated positions in various technical  administrative and other non technical areas 
a number of the affected staff had been assigned to product related projects now considered to be non core to quadramed s long term growth and success 
concurrent with this  new positions were created to meet the changing needs for various skill sets related to the company s go forward product plan 
in addition  we are filling twenty open positions in technical and related areas 
we provided benefits for departed employees through the end of february and offered severance payments along with a commitment to pay bonuses to those impacted in accordance with the incentive compensation plan  when payments under the plan are made in march after all the actions detailed above have occurred  we will employ full time employees  which includes the twenty open positions 
the company expects to report a one time severance cost in q of approximately million 
in february  auctions failed for million of our auction rate securities  and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed  and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not do so 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failure  are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we do not believe these securities are currently impaired  primarily due to the collateral guarantees and aaa ratings of the underlying securities 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december  and february   we held million and million  respectively  of auction rate securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies have a considerable impact on management s discussion and analysis 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant estimates and assumptions have been made regarding revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation input assumptions  the purchase price allocation related to the cpr acquisition  contingencies  litigation  intangibles resulting from our purchase business combinations  charges associated with exit activities and other amounts 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
uncertainties are inherent in all of these estimates including the estimates underlying percentage of completion accounting method of revenue recognition 
in addition  we annually review and test our estimates related to the valuations of intangibles including acquired technology  goodwill  customer lists  trademarks and other intangibles and capitalized software 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition our revenue is principally generated from three sources i licensing arrangements  ii services and iii hardware 
the company s license revenue consists of fees for licenses of the proprietary and third party software 
cost of license revenue primarily includes the costs of third party software  royalties and amortization of acquired technology and capitalized software 
the company s services revenue consists of maintenance  software installation  customer training and consulting services related to our license revenue  fees for providing management services  specialized staffing  and analytical services 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries  benefits and allocated costs related to providing such services 
hardware revenue includes third party hardware used by our customers in connection with software purchased 
cost of hardware revenue consists of third party equipment and installation 
quadramed licenses its products through its direct sales force 
the company s license agreements for such products do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
we recognize revenue on its software products in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
quadramed recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  we no longer have significant obligations with regard to implementation  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier 
the company considers all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond days to be neither fixed nor determinable 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
the company typically defers revenue and recognizes revenue on a cash basis for renewals of term license and support if the company s initial assessment is modified by facts and circumstances and collection is no longer deemed probable 
revenue may also be deferred and recognized on a cash basis if there is a contractual dispute and payments are delayed 
revenue is recognized when the collection becomes reasonably assured and or the contract dispute is resolved 
we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
specifically  we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price if sold separately and measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which we charge for these services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of revenue recognized upon delivery varies from quarter to quarter depending upon the mix of licensing arrangements  perpetual or term based  and the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements 
many of our licensing arrangements include fixed implementation fees and do not allow us to recognize license revenue until these services have been performed 
we recognize revenue only after establishing that we have vsoe for all undelivered elements 
some of the licenses are term or time based licenses 
we recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over the term of the arrangement 
post contract customer support pcs for all of the license term is bundled together with the term license and is included in license revenue on our consolidated financial statements 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  installation or customization 
in such instances  the services and license fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
we use the completed contract method of revenue recognition rather than the percentage of completion method for contracts with short implementation service periods typically less than months and in circumstances in which the company s financial position and results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from the use of the percentage of completion method 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgment related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting can affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in its consolidated financial statements 
the company classifies revenues from these arrangements as license  installation  hardware  and services revenue based on the estimated fair value of each element using the residual method  and revenues are reflected in respective revenue categories in our consolidated financial statements 
service revenues from software maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the maintenance term  which in most cases is one year 
service revenues from training  consulting and other service elements are typically recognized as the services are performed 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from transactions in which customers purchased bundled solutions that included the company s software and third party hardware 
if the bundled solution includes services that provide significant modification  installation or customization  contract accounting is applied in accordance with sop  whereby the revenue is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input hours 
otherwise  hardware revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from deferred maintenance  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered  license revenue is deferred until all revenue requirements have been met or as services are performed 
additionally  there are term based licenses for which revenues are recognized over the term of the contract  which is generally one year 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on our revenue recognition policy  however the company does not have the right to bill the customer per the contract terms 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due us from our customers for the delivery of products and services 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects our estimate of non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and other specifically identified risks 
goodwill and intangible assets we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the determination of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is determined based upon a third party valuation and evaluation of other information 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
the first step tests for determining impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we elected to perform our annual analysis at year end and no indicators of impairment have been identified 
intangible assets subject to amortization include trademarks  customer marketing and technology related assets 
such intangible assets are amortized based on the estimated economic benefit over their estimated useful lives  which are generally two to ten years 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate 
sfas requires that the net deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
this process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
we record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
additionally  we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions based upon our judgment regarding potential future challenges to those positions 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position 
the accounting estimate related to the tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective method as of january  under this method  compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   and for all awards granted  but not vested  prior to january  the adoption of sfas r resulted in million and million of stock option expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prior to january   the company used the intrinsic method of measuring and recognizing employee stock based transactions under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
consequently  no expense was recognized for stock award grants if the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock at the date of grant and expense was recognized if the exercise price was below the market value at the date of grant 
recent accounting standards in september  eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements  eitf was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf requires that  for split dollar life insurance arrangements that provide a benefit to an employee that extends to postretirement periods  an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with sfas no 
eitf requires that recognition of the effects of adoption should be either by a a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or b a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods 
we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or on our financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position to partially delay the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until fiscal years beginning after november  based on the fasb staff position  the partial adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in we are still assessing the impact that sfas no 
will have on our nonrecurring measurements for non financial assets and liabilities in in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial asset and financial liability including an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas no 

the standard permits all entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition date fair values  changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  changes the recognition and measurement of contingent consideration  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas r also requires additional disclosure of information surrounding a business combination  such that users of the entity s financial statements can fully understand the nature and financial impact of the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal an entity may not apply it before that date 
the provisions of sfas r will only impact us if we are party to a business combination after the pronouncement has been adopted 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows

revenue may be deferred and recognized on a cash basis if there is a contractual dispute and payments are delayed  revenue is recognized when the collection becomes reasonably assured and or the contract dispute is resolved 
total revenue 
total revenues for were million  an increase of million or  over total revenue for of million 
the increase of million was comprised of a million increase in services revenue  a million increase in maintenance  a million increase in hardware revenue  and a million increase in installation and other revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in license revenue 
services and other revenue 
services and other revenue consist of professional services  such as implementation and installation services  training  maintenance which consists of technical support and product upgrades  reimbursable expenses and other services revenue 
professional services are typically provided over a period of three to nine months for the health information management suite and two to three years for patient revenue management products 
these services are provided subsequent to the signing of a software license agreement and are integral to the delivery of our software license revenues 
our maintenance revenue depends on both licenses of our software products and renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customer base 
services revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in an increase of million for the smart identity management products was attributable to increased clean up services provided to two significant customers during an increase of million in services was attributable to consulting services related to the cpr products acquired in the asset purchase at the end of third quarter an increase of million in the patient revenue management products was primarily due to services revenue recognized in related to a sale of a hardware configuration to a single customer 
an additional million was attributable to the government solutions workflow analysis project completion and other products  net 
maintenance revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase of million in maintenance revenue is principally due to million in maintenance revenue related to the cpr products purchased in third quarter  a million increase in revenue for maintenance contracts related to the completion of software installations  particularly for patient revenue management  pharmacy and patient access products during and early which triggered post customer support services in these increases were offset by approximately a million decrease due to a combination of other factors  net 
installation revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in  which was due to the net effect of several items 
an increase of million related to our government solutions and an increase of million in the cpr products was offset by a million decrease in installation revenue related to our patient revenue management products  a million decrease for the health information management suite  a million decrease for the smart identity management products  a million decrease for the electronic document management products and a million decrease in pharmacy  patient access and qmi lab radiology products 
the increase in the installation and other services revenue for government solution products was attributable to revenue recognized on installation and training services in conjunction with the roll out of a new government solution license 
the increase in our cpr products is due to revenue recognized on customer installations for the initial quarter since the asset purchase 
installation and other services revenue for the patient revenue management products decreased due to decreased hours worked on contracts that were being recognized on the percentage of completion poc method 
the decreases in the health information management suite  smart identity management products  electronic document management products  pharmacy products and patient access products were principally attributable to a decreased number and size of active contracts completed in installation revenue related to the health information management suite term licenses is recognized ratably over the license term 
installation and other revenue for health information management suite perpetual licenses  patient access and government solutions products are typically recognized upon completion of implementation 
the installation and other revenue for our other products  including patient revenue management and cpr products  is recognized on a contract basis of accounting 
licenses 
license revenue consists of fees and licenses for our owned  proprietary software  as well as third party owned software that we bundle into our suite of products 
overall  license revenue decreased million  or less than  to million in from million in term license revenue increased or million to million in from million in term license revenue for government solutions products increased by approximately million in  to million in from million in  this was primarily due to the installation of our vip software at the veterans administration sites during term license revenues for the health information management suite and decision support products decreased by approximately million each from to due primarily to revenue recognized from cash basis customers in perpetual license revenue decreased or million to million in from million in the net decrease of million was the result of a million decrease for the patient access products  a million decrease for the patient revenue management products  a million decrease for the health information management suite  a million decrease for the electronic document management products  and a million decrease for other products 
the decrease in the health information management suite revenue was principally attributable to revenue recognized in when cash was collected from certain customers where revenue had been deferred due to disputes or delayed payments 
once collection was assured  revenue was recognized for the deferred amounts 
a decreased number and size of active contracts in attributed to the decreased revenue for the electronic document management  patient access  pharmacy  smart identity management  patient revenue management and acuity plus products 
hardware 
hardware revenue consists of the sale of third party hardware purchased specifically for use by our customers 
hardware revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in compared to is primarily attributable to hardware revenue recognized in the second quarter of related to a sale of a large hardware configuration to a single customer 
deferred revenue the following table presents a summary roll forward schedule of the deferred revenue in thousands for each quarter of the respective years for the three months ended  march  june  september  december  total unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited deferred revenue  beginning balance add revenue deferred add acquired deferred revenue  net cpr less deferred revenue recognized less acquired deferred revenue recognized  net cpr deferred revenue  ending balance for the three months ended  march  june  september  december  total unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited deferred revenue  beginning balance add revenue deferred add sab implementation less deferred revenue recognized deferred revenue  ending balance deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
fluctuation within the deferred revenue balance is dependent upon the timing associated with reaching billing milestones and revenue recognition criteria 
deferred revenue is typically increased when the company invoices a customer based on the terms of the contracts and is decreased when revenue is recognized based on percentage of completion  the attainment of a milestone  or the passage of time in the case of a contract recognized ratably 
the majority of the company s revenue flows through the deferred revenue accounts due to favorable payment terms such as execution payments and achievement of billing milestones prior to meeting all revenue recognition requirements 
deferred revenue tends to be greater in the first quarter compared to subsequent quarters due to the issuance of annual maintenance invoices 
the deferred revenue balance decreased approximately million to million at december  when compared to million at december  the december  balance is comprised of million in license revenue  million in maintenance revenue  and million in services and other revenue 
the balance as of december  was comprised of million in license revenue  million in maintenance revenue  and million in services and other revenue 
the decrease in the deferred revenue balance during compared to december  was principally attributable to a decrease in the deferred revenue related to veterans health administration contracts and to the revenue recognized in the second quarter of related to the large hardware sale 
the deferred revenue balance as of december  includes only million for veterans health administration contracts compared to million included as of december   this is due primarily to differences in billing methodologies during the fourth quarter of compared to previous years  where advance billing was permitted in part 
in addition  during the second quarter of  million of revenue was recognized related to the sale of hardware to a single customer  all of which had been held in the deferred revenue account balance at december  and throughout the decrease is also attributable to the large value of all contracts excluding the aforementioned hardware sale  approximating million  for which we recognized revenue upon completion of milestones during  this is compared to only million in these changes were minimally affected by the net activity for the deferred revenues acquired for cpr products 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of services and other revenue 
cost of services and other revenue consists of salaries and related expenses associated with project implementation  consulting services  and customer support 
cost of services and other revenue increased or million to million in from million in approximately million of the increase between years correlates to the million increase in services  installation and other revenues  and is driven by headcount and third party contractors utilized in delivering that revenue  particularly for the va contract and our smart identify management customers 
in addition  approximately million of the increase was a result of the wage hour reclassification that was implemented in the third quarter of most of the remaining million increase is due to increases in wage and benefit costs for the core business  represented by an average of employees throughout the year  as well as the incremental employees added in the fourth quarter as a result of the cpr acquisition 
as a percentage of services and other revenue  cost of services and other was in compared to in  reflecting primarily the increase in the fixed cost base organizations as discussed 
cost of licenses 
cost of licenses consists primarily of third party software  royalties and amortization of acquired technology and capitalized software 
a significant percentage of our total cost of revenue is the cost of third party software royalties and licenses relating to third party software embedded in our software applications 
generally  royalty fees for third party licenses will fluctuate based on revenue or the number of the company s customers 
royalties are associated primarily with our health information management suite and government solutions product revenues 
cost of licenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the million increase is primarily the net of two significant items during first  royalty payments related to our veterans administration contract increased million  correlating to similarly proportionate increases in revenue 
this increase in royalties was offset in part by a million net decrease in amortization of acquired and capitalized software 
as a percentage of license revenue  cost of license was in compared to in  reflecting primarily the increase in payments to third parties 
cost of hardware 
cost of hardware consists of third party hardware and installation costs 
cost of hardware increased or million to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the large hardware sale to a single customer during  at virtually no margin 
as a percentage of hardware revenue  cost of hardware was in compared to in gross margin 
total gross margin decreased by approximately million  or  to million in from million in overall  gross margin declined by seven percentage points  to in from in as discussed above  cost of services and other revenue is the primary contributor to this margin deterioration  in addition to the million hardware sale to a single customer  which is not expected to reoccur 
the impact of the higher internal costs of services driven by changes in the fixed cost base organizations and the incremental costs from the cpr acquisition are expected to be ongoing for the most part 
third party costs for our government solution products will also continue  but only as a function of the associated revenues from the veterans administration 
operating expenses general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of compensation and benefit costs for executive  finance  legal  information technology  and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense was in compared to in in  general and administrative expenses significantly decreased primarily due to the absence of the million legal settlement with medcath in the first quarter of  together with million in lower legal fees and million lower bad debt expense  which were offset by higher salary and wage related expenses and million higher professional services fees 
software development 
software development expense includes costs associated with the development of new products for which technological feasibility has not been achieved  enhancements of existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs 
software development expense increased million  or  to million in from million in in  the increase was primarily related to higher salaries  benefits and cost of employee stock options  offset by lower bonus expense and severance costs which occurred as a result of the march reduction in force 
benefit costs increased due to a full reserve being established against an outstanding receivable from one of our retirement program vendors 
as a percentage of revenue  software development expense was in compared to in there were no capitalized software development costs in or sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales  marketing and certain product management personnel  and consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  bonuses  promotional and advertising expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by or million in to million from million in this increase is primarily attributable to million higher salary and wage related costs along with a million increase in travel costs due to the higher headcount associated with the organization structure change implemented in in addition  a million increase in advertising and promotion costs was incurred during as a result of marketing efforts associated with the cpr acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense was approximately for and for amortization of intangible assets and depreciation 
amortization of intangible assets pertains to identifiable intangible assets such as customer lists and trade names  among other items 
depreciation expense pertains to computer and office equipment  office furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
amortization of intangible assets decreased million to million in compared to million in depreciation expense decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in as compared to was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures and the intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year 
other income expense other income expense  net 
net other income was million as of december  compared to net other income of million as of december  the million increase was primarily due to the million gain on the liquidation of our investment in vantagemed corporation for which we recorded other than temporary impairment charges from to resulting in a fair value of this investment of zero in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
benefit provision for income taxes in previous years  we provided a full tax valuation allowance for our federal  state  and foreign deferred tax assets based on management s evaluation that our ability to realize such assets did not meet the criteria of more likely than not 
we have continuously evaluated additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of our ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as well as deductible temporary differences 
in the year ended december   management has determined  based on new positive evidence as the result of two consecutive years of pretax operating income and and anticipated future taxable income over the next year s budgeted and forecast amounts  that it is now more likely than not that most of these deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
accordingly  we determined that it is appropriate to reduce the deferred tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million as of december  this has resulted in a benefit to deferred tax expense of million for the year  a reduction of goodwill from prior acquisitions of million  and an adjustment to additional paid in capital of million 
the million benefit is comprised of a federal benefit of million and a state benefit of million  and a foreign provision of million 
year ended december  compared to the following table sets forth selected data for the indicated periods 
percentages are expressed as a percentage of total revenues  except for cost of revenue  which is expressed as a percentage of the related revenue classification

total revenue 
total revenue for of million increased million  or  over total revenue for of million 
the net increase of million consists of a million increase in maintenance revenue  a million increase in license revenue  a million increase in installation and other revenue and a million increase in services revenue  all offset by a million decrease in hardware revenue 
significant contributors to the overall increase in revenues during were the collection of certain past due accounts and the resolution of certain project implementations 
for each quarter during  total revenue was million  million  million and million  respectively 
services and other revenue 
services and other revenue consist of professional services  such as implementation and installation services  training  maintenance which consists of technical support and product upgrades  reimbursable expenses and other service revenue 
professional services are typically provided over a period of three to nine months for the health information management suite and two to three years for patient revenue management products 
these services are provided subsequent to the signing of a software license arrangement and depend in large part on our software license revenues 
our maintenance revenue depends on both licenses of our software products and renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customer base 
services revenue increased approximately million  or  to million in from million in an increase of approximately million was attributed to patient revenue management products as a result of completion of significant supplemental service and third party service projects 
an increase of million for government solutions products and an increase of million for acuity plus products were related to completion of workflow analyses and benchmarking studies  respectively 
the service revenue for the health information management suite also increased approximately million due to completion of supplemental services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million for the smart identity management products and a decrease of million for the edi products 
services revenue for the smart identify management products decreased as a result of completing two large contracts in while the decrease for the edi products was as a result of the sale of the edi business in the third quarter of maintenance revenue increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in of this overall increase in maintenance revenue  million and million resulted from the health information management suite and patient revenue management products  respectively 
maintenance revenue for decision support  pharmacy  and acuity plus products also increased approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increases were principally due to revenue that was recognized from certain cash basis customers and reactivation of revenue plans that were previously on hold  as well as contractually based increases in fees  partially offset by a decrease of million attributed to the edi products 
installation and other revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is driven primarily by an million increase in training revenue for government solutions products  a million increase in installation and other revenue for patient revenue management products and a million increase in patient access product revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in the health information management suite  a million decrease in acuity plus products and a million decrease in smart identity management product revenue 
resolution of disputed projects and completion of delayed projects caused installation and other revenue for patient revenue management products to increase 
during  we had two new patient revenue management sales 
installation and other revenue for patient access products increased principally due to completion of implementation activities for four large contracts in the decreases in installation and other revenue for the health information management suite  acuity plus and smart identity management products are primarily the result of a decreased number of significant contracts being completed in installation and other revenue for the health information management suite  patient access and government solutions products is typically recognized upon completion of implementation  whereas the installation and other revenue for many of our other products  including patient revenue management  are recognized on a contract basis of accounting 
licenses 
license revenue consists of fees and licenses for our owned  proprietary software  as well as third party owned software that we bundle into our suite of products 
license revenue increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in term license revenue increased or million to million in from million in term license revenue for government solution products increased by approximately million in compared to  mainly due to a full year s recognition of term license revenue from veterans administration sites that were added during term license revenues for the health information management suite increased approximately million in compared to  due primarily to incremental revenue recognized from cash basis customers 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in term license revenue for decision support products 
perpetual license revenue decreased or million to million in from million in the net decrease of million was the result of a million decrease in the patient revenue management products  a million decrease in health information management suite  a million for other products 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase the patient access products 
perpetual license revenue for patient revenue management and pharmacy products decreased due to decreased hours worked in as well as decreased third party license revenue 
hours worked for patient revenue management projects were less in compared to  resulting in decreased revenue for these contracts which are being recognized on the poc basis 
the decrease in the perpetual license revenue for the health information management suite was attributable to a decreased number and size of active contracts in the decrease for other products is due in part to the sale of the edi business in perpetual license revenue for patient access products increased due to increased numbers of significant contracts being completed in compared to hardware 
hardware revenue decreased or million to million for compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributed to decreased poc hours in as well as completion of certain contracts in deferred revenue the following table presents a summary roll forward schedule of the deferred revenue in thousands for each quarter of the respective years for the three months ended  march  june  september  december  total unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited deferred revenue  beginning balance add revenue deferred add sab implementation less deferred revenue recognized deferred revenue  ending balance for the three months ended  march  june  september  december  total unaudited unaudited unaudited unaudited deferred revenue  beginning balance add revenue deferred less deferred revenue recognized less other deferred revenue  ending balance deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
fluctuation of the deferred revenue balance depends on the timing associated with reaching billing milestones and revenue recognition criteria 
deferred revenue is typically increased when the company invoices a customer based on the terms of the contracts and is decreased when revenue is recognized based on percentage of completion or attainment of a milestone in the customer contract 
revenue deferred tends to be greater in the first quarter due to the issuance of annual maintenance invoices 
revenue deferred also tends to be higher in the fourth quarter compared to the second and third quarters primarily due to the issuance of invoices related to our government business 
the majority of the company s government contract terms start on october of each year 
the majority of the company s revenue flows through the deferred revenue accounts and is attributable to favorable payment terms such as execution payments and achievement of billing milestones prior to meeting all revenue recognition criteria 
the deferred revenue balance decreased approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the decrease in the deferred revenue balance is attributable to revenue recognized as a result of settlements of disputed contracts  resolution of stalled projects and amounts received from cash basis customers 
million of the decrease was related to the decreased deferred revenue balance for the government contracts due to a change in billing terms 
million of the decrease was attributable to a termination of support for a single customer  and million of the decrease was attributable to revenue recognized for health information management product perpetual license contracts as a result of completion of implementation during the first quarter of these decreases were offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million relating to the company s implementation of sab see note staff accounting bulletin no

cost of revenue and gross margin cost of services and other revenue 
cost of services and other revenue decreased million to million in from million in as a percentage of services and other revenue  cost of services and other revenue was in  compared to in cost of licenses 
a significant percentage of our total cost of revenue is the cost of third party software royalties and licenses relating to third party software embedded in our software applications 
cost of licenses increased million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to a million increase in royalty expense in  as a result of higher government solutions and health information management suite revenues 
as a percentage of revenue  royalty expenses increased from to year over year  primarily due to changes in the revenue mix within the health information management suite and government solutions product lines 
cost of hardware 
cost of hardware consists of third party hardware and installation costs 
cost of hardware decreased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of lower hardware revenue in  and better margins overall on the mix of hardware installations 
gross margin 
total gross margin increased by approximately million  or  to million in from million in the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an overall increase in revenues of million  offset in part by a net increase of million in cost of revenue  primarily due to third party royalties 
overall  gross margin remained constant at for both and operating expenses general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of compensation and benefit costs for executive  finance  legal  information technology  and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expense was in compared to in in  general and administrative expenses significantly decreased primarily due to the absence of million in severance costs principally associated with the departure of former executives during  a decrease of million in bad debt expense as a result of our collection efforts and million lower professional and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley implementation and compliance  strategic activities and consulting services with regard to our peoplesoft system conversion 
the remaining decrease is principally due to lower salary and wage related expenses as a result of the march reduction in force and organization structure changes and the implementation of cost savings initiatives during which resulted in lower telecom and other administrative expenses 
these decreases are offset by the incurrence of million in legal settlement costs in software development 
software development expense includes costs associated with the development of new products for which technological feasibility has not been achieved  enhancements of existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs 
software development expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in in  higher bonus expense and cost of employee stock options were offset by lower overall personnel related costs due to the march reduction in force and organizational structure changes as well as associated benefit costs  lower consulting  travel  and general operating expenses

sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales  marketing and certain product management personnel  and consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  bonuses  promotional and advertising expenses 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense was in compared to in the most significant changes between the years resulted from lower salary and wage related expenses offset by higher professional fees  training and marketing expenses 
amortization of intangible assets and depreciation 
amortization of intangible assets pertains to identifiable intangible assets such as customer lists and trade names  among other items 
depreciation expense pertains to computer and office equipment  office furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
amortization of intangible assets decreased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to existing intangible assets becoming fully amortized during which offsets the increase in intangible amortization from the cpr acquisition 
depreciation expense decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in depreciation in as compared to was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures 
exit cost of facility closing 
during  we moved our headquarters from san rafael  california to reston  virginia vacating the san rafael office facility 
the lease for this facility terminates at the end of in  we subleased of the available space 
we have estimated the closing costs for this facility based upon current market information available related to potential sublease rental income  sublease commission costs  and the length of time expected to secure a sublease 
in consideration of these facts  in we estimated a cost of approximately million in connection with our future obligations on the lease  net of estimated sublease income  and recorded this as expense and as an accrued exit cost at december  during the third quarter of  we reevaluated our estimated sublease income assumptions  and recorded an additional expense with a corresponding increase in the liability of million 
an adjustment to the outstanding lease liability was not warranted at december  other income expense other income expense 
other income expense increased million  from a net other income of million in to a net other income of million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher rates of return associated with our money market accounts and the implementation of a low risk investment strategy designed to capitalize on the higher short term interest rates on high grade commercial paper and government bonds 
the increase in interest income was offset in part by higher corporate state income tax expense 
interest expense  which decreased million in from  included non cash charges of million in and million in relating to amortization of the preferred stock dividend discount and interest due on notes payable 
discontinued operations of financial services division we announced the shutdown of this division on december  the shutdown of this division was effective february  during  the company recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with our future obligations on the division s san marcos  california lease  net of estimated sublease income 
the lease for this facility terminates in may we estimated facility closing costs based upon current market information available related to sublease rental income and associated commission costs 
in  we subleased of the available space 
the results of operations for financial services division are presented as a discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation of the financial services division was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  revenues loss from operations of discontinued operations exit cost of facility closing other total loss liquidity and capital resources balance sheet as of december   we had million in cash and investments  compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash and investments was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the cpr business in the third quarter of for million in cash 
this use of cash was offset in part by million cash flow from operations see discussion of cash flows below 
as of december   we had net working capital of million compared to million as of december  the decrease in working capital is due primarily to the aforementioned acquisition 
as of february   our cash and investment balance was approximately million 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet our short term cash requirements 
accounts receivable  net  increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  accounts receivable increased primarily due to the addition of receivable balances in connection with the acquisition of the cpr business  and delays in billings for the veterans administration va fiscal year contract which was signed in november  all offset by strong cash collections 
for the year ended december   bad debt expense was million  and as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased to million from million as of december  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified within the portfolio 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowance might be required 
approximately million of accounts receivables were written off during the current year  offset by million of bad debt recoveries 
our reported days sales outstanding dso was at december   compared to at december  approximately four days of the year end dso are due to the acquired cpr receivables  and eight days are due to the past due receivables for the va all of which were paid during the first week of january 
absent the effects of the cpr acquisition and the va issues  proforma dso at december  would have been days compared to the days at december  unbilled receivables increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  this increase was mainly attributable to the addition of the unbilled balances in connection with the acquisition of the cpr business 
deferred contract expenses increased by million as of december  to million  compared to million as of december  this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the cpr business in the third quarter of and the timing of revenue recognition with regard to our customer contracts 
goodwill increased by million as of december  to million  compared to million as of december  this increase is directly attributable to the acquisition of the cpr business in september offset by a million reduction resulting from the assessment of the tax value of acquired net operating loss carryforwards from previous acquisitions as required under purchase accounting 
see note income taxes for further discussion other intangible assets increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in acquired software  trade names and customer lists resulted from the acquisition of the cpr business 
deferred income tax assets increased to million as of december  from zero as of december  this increase is due to the release of the valuation allowance that was previously netted against the deferred tax asset 
each year  we have evaluated facts and other evidence with respect to our probable ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards approximately million  as well as temporary deductible differences approximately million 
for the year ended december   based on two consecutive years of pre tax operating income  as well as expected continuing pre tax operating income  we have determined that it is more likely than not that most of these deferred tax assets will now be realized  and therefore we have reduced a significant portion of the valuation allowance that we had heretofore maintained 
as a result  we expect to record income tax expense for accounting purposes in the future  corresponding to any income before income taxes that we report in those future periods 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to the timing of payments at year end for marketing  legal and professional fees  as well as the additional vendor obligations associated with the cpr acquisition 
accrued payroll and other related liabilities increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily as a result of an additional million in incentive compensation accruals  million in vacation and retirement plan benefits accruals  and million in accrued salaries due to the timing of payroll cycles at year end  which were offset by million lower medical benefit and severance accruals 
other accrued liabilities increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  this increase was primarily related to a million increase in accrued legal expense  million increase in professional fees  and a million increase in accrued royalties due to the delayed payments by our government customer 
dividends payable decreased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease corresponds to the accretion in the carrying value of the company s series a preferred stock issued in with a corresponding decrease in the mandatory payable of accrued dividends 
see note series a preferred stock offset by preferred dividends declared subsequent to the conclusion of the mandatory dividend 
we have not declared or paid cash or other dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
our ability to pay dividends on the common shares is restricted by the terms of our series a preferred stock which require us to pay full cumulative dividends on the series a preferred stock before making any dividend payment on our common stock 
the series a preferred stock is entitled to quarterly dividends of per annum per share 
the deferred revenue balance decreased approximately million to million at december  when compared to million at december  the december  balance is comprised of million in license revenue  million in maintenance revenue  and million in services and other revenue 
the balance as of december  was comprised of million in license revenue  million in maintenance revenue  and million in services and other revenue 
the decrease in the deferred revenue balance during compared to december  was principally attributable to a decrease in the deferred revenue related to veterans health administration contracts and to the revenue recognized in the second quarter of related to the large hardware sale 
the deferred revenue balance as of december  includes only million for veterans health administration contracts compared to million included as of december   this is due primarily to differences in billing methodologies during the fourth quarter of compared to previous years  where advance billing was permitted in part 
in addition  during the second quarter of  million of revenue was recognized related to the sale of hardware to a single customer  all of which had been held in the deferred revenue account balance at december  and throughout the decrease is also attributable to the large value of all contracts excluding the aforementioned hardware sale  approximating million  for which we recognized revenue upon completion of milestones during  this is compared to only million in these changes were minimally affected by the net activity for the deferred revenues acquired for cpr products 
accrued exit cost of facility closing pertains to the long term portion of the accrued future lease obligations related to the closed facilities in san marcos  california and san rafael  california 
the balance decreased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is due to the amortization of the original lease loss obligation established at the point the facilities were vacated 
deferred income tax liability decreased by million to zero as of december  resulting from the netting of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of december  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million

cash flows we generate cash from licensing our software and providing professional services 
in addition  we generate cash through maintenance renewals where customers generally pay us at the beginning of the contract term 
these contract terms commence at different times throughout each year 
we primarily use cash to pay our employees salaries  commission and benefits  pay landlords to lease office space  procure insurance  pay taxes  pay dividends on series a preferred stock and pay vendors for services and supplies

year ended december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in for the nine months ended september  we had million of cash provided  however during the fourth quarter of the year  we had a net million of cash used by operations 
this fourth quarter use of cash was attributable to three significant factors one of our largest customers  the veterans administration  made no payments on its license for the three months of usage during the quarter  but instead remitted the million in early january  net of direct costs that were also delayed 
this item accounted for approximately million net of the use of cash in the quarter 
as previously discussed elsewhere  we paid approximately million during the quarter to employees for wage hour reclassifications 
during this first post closing quarter of operations for the acquired cpr assets  we had approximately million use of cash due in part to the additional payroll and operating costs assumed  but also due to collecting only million of the million of acquired receivables during the quarter 
further it should be noted that in  we collected approximately million of aged accounts receivable through our initiative that reduced dso from days at the beginning of  to days at december   of this million  approximately million represented revenue recognized that originated prior to  but which was delayed due to various issues including collectibilty 
in  net cash used in investing activities was million  compared to million used in and million provided by investing activities in the use of cash in from investing activities primarily resulted from the acquisition of the cpr business for million in cash plus payment for outside services and million used for the purchase of property and equipment 
in  investing activities included million of capital expenditure purchases and million in net purchases of securities 
in  investing activities provided million of cash including a million decrease in restricted cash related to letters of credit  million of capital expenditure purchases and million from the liquidation of certain assets held in trust which were used in connection with a settlement associated with a former executive who left the company several years ago 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million  compared to million used in and million net cash used in the cash used by financing activities in each of the respective years was primarily due to the payment of dividends on our series a preferred stock of million  million and million  respectively 
the dividends were partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in each of the respective periods 
in addition  on december  we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase with available cash  up to million of the company s common stock 
as of december   we repurchased  shares at a cost of million  which is reflected in the cash used by financing activities

in the schedule above  the sublease income has been deducted from the minimum future rentals required under the master lease 
the lease and related sublease expire in december the less than year amount of million includes a million letter of credit in favor of the state of new jersey under its contract  and another million letter of credit for another customer contract 
the remainder represents security deposits for leased facilities 
as of december   we had approximately million in minimum operating lease commitments that will be paid through in addition  we have million of funds in certificates of deposit held as collateral for the aforementioned standby letters of credit under bank financing agreements 
these amounts reflect current requirements as of december   and may be reduced in the future 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  specifically the timing of when we recognize revenue  our accounts receivable collections and the timing of other payments 
in addition  cash used in investing activities may fluctuate due to our software development efforts  any acquisition or disposition we may undertake and costs associated with our investments in fixed assets and information technology

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation the majority of our revenue is derived from perpetual and long term customer contracts 
contract terms range from one to five years and the contracts generally allow for price increases annually based on specified rates or external measures of inflation 
we have increased some of our prices under certain contract provisions 
our maintenance contract terms also provide for annual price increases based on specified rates or external measures of inflation 
accordingly  inflation has not had  and we do not believe that it will have  a significant impact on our financial condition

risk factors above 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio 
it is our intent to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we invest in high quality issuers  including money market funds  corporate debt securities  and debt securities issued by the us government and us governmental agencies 
we do not invest in derivative financial or foreign investments 
in february  auctions failed for million of our auction rate securities  and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed  and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not do so 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failure  are currently rated aaa  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we do not believe these securities are currently impaired  primarily due to the collateral guarantees and aaa ratings of the underlying securities 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december  and february   we held million and million  respectively  of auction rate securities
