item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates that utilize the body s natural nutrient transporter mechanisms to improve the therapeutic benefits of drugs 
we intend to focus our development and commercialization efforts on potential treatments of central nervous system  or cns  disorders 
our most advanced product candidate  xp is currently being evaluated for the treatment of restless legs syndrome  or rls  in a phase clinical program in the united states and has also successfully completed a phase a clinical trial for the management of post herpetic neuralgia  or phn  in the united states 
one of our partners  astellas pharma inc  is evaluating this product candidate in two separate phase clinical trials in japan for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy  or pdn  and rls 
another of our partners  glaxo group limited  or gsk  plans to evaluate xp for phn  pdn and migraine prophylaxis 
we are evaluating our second product candidate  xp  for the potential treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd  and for the potential treatment of spasticity in separate phase clinical trials 
we initiated a phase clinical trial of our third product candidate  xp  that we plan to evaluate as a potential treatment for parkinson s disease 
our current portfolio of proprietary product candidates includes the following xp for rls 
xp is a transported prodrug of gabapentin 
xp is currently being evaluated for the treatment of rls in a phase clinical program in the united states and in a phase clinical trial in japan 
rls is characterized by an irresistible urge to move one s legs  usually accompanied by unpleasant sensations or pain in the legs 
we have announced top line data from two rls phase clinical trials that demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to placebo on the primary endpoints of these trials and that xp was generally well tolerated 
xp for neuropathic pain 
we have also shown in a phase a clinical trial that xp is effective for the management of phn  a chronic type of neuropathic pain that can follow the resolution of shingles 
xp is being studied by our partner  astellas  in a phase clinical trial in japan for the treatment of pdn  a chronic type of neuropathic pain that results from diabetes 
our partner  gsk  has announced that it intends to initiate in the first quarter of this year a neuropathic pain program that will include two phase clinical trials designed to show the safety and efficacy of xp in the management of phn  as well as a phase clinical trial designed to show the safety and efficacy of xp in the treatment of pdn 
xp for migraine prophylaxis 
migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that are usually accompanied by various combinations of symptoms  including nausea and vomiting  as well as distorted vision and sensitivity to light and sound 
migraine prophylaxis is designed to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks 
gsk has announced plans to initiate in the second half of this year parallel  pivotal phase clinical trials designed to show the safety and efficacy of xp in preventing migraines in patients  along with a long term clinical trial designed to establish safety in this patient population  following agreement with the us food and drug administration  or fda 
xp for gerd 
xp is a transported prodrug of r baclofen that we are developing for the treatment of gerd  which is a digestive system disorder caused primarily by transient relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter  which is a combination of muscles that controls the junction between the esophagus and the stomach 
gerd is characterized by the frequent  undesirable passage of stomach contents into the esophagus that results in discomfort and potential damage to the lining of the esophagus 
we have successfully completed a phase a clinical trial indicating that single doses of xp were well tolerated and produced statistically significant reductions in the number of reflux episodes in patients with gerd 
we initiated a second phase clinical trial of xp in patients with gerd in the fourth quarter of xp for spasticity 
xp is also a potential treatment for spasticity  a condition in which certain muscles are continuously contracted  causing stiffness or tightness of muscles that interferes with movement or speech 
racemic baclofen  which contains both r baclofen and s baclofen  is currently approved in the united states for the treatment of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis  spinal cord injury and other 
table of contents spinal cord diseases 
we believe that spasticity patients may benefit from xp due to less frequent dosing and a more desirable pharmacokinetic profile than racemic baclofen 
we initiated a phase clinical trial of xp in spinal cord injury patients with spasticity in the fourth quarter of xp for parkinson s disease 
xp is a transported prodrug of levodopa  or l dopa  that we are developing for the treatment of parkinson s disease  a neurological disorder of the elderly  characterized by tremor  rigidity and loss of reflexes 
we initiated a phase clinical trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of xp in the fourth quarter of xp for migraine 
xp is a transported prodrug of propofol that is in preclinical development for the treatment of migraine 
we have commenced preclinical development activities to support the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  for xp xp for the treatment of women with menorrhagia 
xp is a transported prodrug of tranexamic acid 
tranexamic acid is a man made derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid lysine and works to inhibit  on a molecular basis  the break down of blood clots 
it is approved in many countries in europe and asia for the treatment of women with menorrhagia  or heavy menstrual bleeding 
in october  we announced an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of xp by xanodyne pharmaceuticals  inc in the united states 
we were incorporated in may and commenced active operations in august to date  we have not generated any product revenues 
we have funded our research and development operations primarily through sales of our preferred stock  our initial and follow on public offerings  non equity payments from our collaborators and government grants 
we have received additional funding from capital lease financings and interest earned on investments 
prior to the three months ended june   we had incurred net losses since our inception 
however  due to the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments from our collaborations with gsk  astellas and xanodyne we were profitable in the three month periods ended june  september  and december  and may have profitable quarters from time to time 
while recognition of these revenues resulted in a profitable year for  we continue to expect to incur losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and seek to advance our product candidates into later stages of development 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to increasing headcount  investment in our preclinical development programs and xp development costs  partially offset by decreasing expenses for our xp phase rls clinical program 
subject to regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  we expect to incur significant expenses associated with the establishment of a north american specialty sales force 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development  we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses if we establish a north american specialty sales force 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
from our inception in through  our principal activities were focused on identifying and characterizing natural nutrient transporter mechanisms and developing the technology necessary to utilize them for the active transport of drugs 
beginning in  our activities expanded to include the preclinical and clinical development of internally discovered product candidates based on this proprietary technology 
in addition to our ongoing research program  the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development will require significant additional research and development expenditures  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and regulatory activities 
we outsource a substantial portion of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
in december  we entered into a collaboration with alza corporation to discover  develop and commercialize transported prodrugs of certain generic parent drugs that are poorly absorbed in the intestines 
this collaboration ended in march alza made an up front  non refundable cash payment upon initiation of the collaboration and provided annual research funding on a full time equivalent employee basis 
in november  we entered into a collaboration with pfizer inc to develop technologies to assess the role of active transport mechanisms in delivering drugs into the central nervous system 
pfizer made an up front payment 
table of contents and supported a number of full time equivalent employees through november the program was exclusive during the term of the collaboration and provided pfizer with non exclusive rights to resulting technologies 
in december  we issued  shares of our series d convertible preferred stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
holders of the series d convertible preferred stock were entitled to receive dividends in shares of series d convertible preferred stock at the rate of per share per annum 
we have reported the loss applicable to common stockholders after giving effect to the dividends paid 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering in june   shares of our series d convertible preferred stock were issued as in kind dividends payable on our series d convertible preferred stock  and all of the outstanding shares of series d convertible preferred stock  including the in kind dividends  were automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
in june  in connection with our initial public offering  we issued  shares of our common stock  raising net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in july  the underwriters partially exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock  for which we received net cash proceeds of approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in december  we entered into an agreement in which we licensed to astellas exclusive rights to develop and commercialize xp in japan  korea  the philippines  indonesia  thailand and taiwan collectively referred to as the astellas territory 
we received an initial license payment of million from astellas 
the terms of the agreement also specify clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to a maximum of million  including milestone payments of million upon initiation of our first phase clinical trial of xp in rls patients in the united states  which we received in april  and million at the completion of our first phase clinical trial of xp in rls patients in the united states  which we received in may we will receive royalties on any sales of xp in the astellas territory at a royalty rate in the mid teens on a percentage basis 
as of december   we had recognized an aggregate of million of revenue pursuant to this agreement 
in june  in connection with a follow on public offering  we issued  shares of our common stock  raising net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
also in june  the underwriters partially exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock  resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
in february  we announced an exclusive collaboration with gsk to develop and commercialize xp worldwide  excluding the astellas territory collectively referred to as the gsk territory 
gsk made an up front  non refundable license payment to us of million  that we received in march  and gsk has agreed to make additional payments of up to million upon the achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones  of which million has been received to date  and up to million upon the achievement of specified sales levels 
under the terms of the agreement  gsk is responsible for all future development costs  with the exception of specified development costs that we will assume in connection with the development of xp for rls in the united states 
we are entitled to receive royalties based upon a percentage of sales of xp in the gsk territory for a specified period of time  unless we elect the option to co promote xp in united states 
in the event that we elect the co promotion option for xp  we would share marketing and commercialization costs and would be entitled to a share of operating profits from sales of xp in the united states for so long as xp is sold  as well as receive payments on details we perform in the united states on requip xl  gsk s development stage product candidate for parkinson s disease 
subject to fda approval of the new drug application  or nda  for xp  we would co promote xp in the united states to those same prescribers 
as of december   we had recognized an aggregate of million of revenue pursuant to this agreement 
in october  we announced an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of xp in the united states by xanodyne for the potential treatment of women diagnosed with menorrhagia 
in exchange for these rights  we are entitled to receive up front  non refundable cash payments totaling million  of which million was paid to us upon execution of the agreement and the remaining million is due on the month anniversary of the execution date 
we are eligible to receive aggregate cash payments of up to 
table of contents million upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to xp  as well as aggregate cash payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to xanodyne s tranexamic acid product candidate  known as xpb  that is currently in phase clinical development 
in addition  we are entitled to receive tiered  double digit royalty payments on potential future sales of xp  as well as escalating single digit royalties on potential future sales of xpb 
as of december   we had recognized an aggregate of million of revenue pursuant to this agreement 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we have entered into collaboration agreements with alza  astellas  gsk  pfizer and xanodyne  each of which contains multiple elements 
we account for these agreements in accordance with the provisions of securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we considered a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements can be considered separate units of accounting  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there is a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
specifically  we account for each of these typical elements as follows up front  licensing type fees 
to date  these types of fees have been classified within the collaboration agreements as license fees  access fees  rights fees and initial licensing fees  and each of them was non refundable and payable in connection with the execution of the contract 
up front  licensing type payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain any stand alone value from the license 
where this is not the case  we do not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting  and we defer the revenue with revenue recognition for the license fee being assessed in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting 
milestones 
we assess milestones on an individual basis and recognize revenue from these milestones when earned  as evidenced by acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the milestone represents the culmination  or progress towards the culmination  of an earnings process and iii the milestone payment is non refundable 
where separate milestones do not meet these criteria  we typically default to a performance based model  with revenue recognition following delivery of effort as compared to an estimate of total expected effort 
milestones that are received after all substantive deliverables have occurred are considered to be bonus payments and are recognized upon receipt of the cash  assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria are met 
collaborative research payments 
generally  the payments received are based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project  and we recognize revenue related to these payments as the services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 

table of contents grant revenues 
grant revenues are recognized as research is performed 
grant revenues are non refundable 
combined units of accounting 
where there are multiple deliverables combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are deferred and recognized over the period which we remain obligated to perform services or deliver product 
the specific methodology for the recognition of the revenue eg  straight line or according to specific performance criteria is determined on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given contract 
our collaboration agreements also include potential payments for commercial product supply  product royalties and sharing of operating profits 
to date  we have not received revenue from these sources 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
sfas r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  for stock options and stock purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock compensation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of apb  and related interpretations  and provided the disclosures required under sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
prior to our initial public offering in june  we had granted 
table of contents certain stock options with exercise prices that were below the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded employee stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation of million 
we elected to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective application method  which was applied to the unvested portion of options granted prior to january  and all options granted after january  the effect of recording stock based compensation under sfas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to unvested options and awards not yet recognized was million 
this amount will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r  we reassessed our valuation method and related assumptions 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
and with the method used to compute our prior period pro forma disclosures of loss available to common stockholders  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight line attribution method over the vesting period 
restricted stock units are measured at the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the period of vesting using the straight line attribution approach 
upon the adoption of sfas r on january   we reversed all of the existing balance of deferred stock compensation of million with a corresponding reduction in additional paid in capital 
sfas r requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
both the expected stock price volatility and the weighted average expected life assumptions were determined using data obtained from similar entities  taking into consideration factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had also used this approach in calculating both expected stock price volatility and weighted average expected life assumptions 
we account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard board  financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
subsequent recognition  derecognition and measurement is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and the california state jurisdiction 
to date  we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state income tax jurisdiction 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
to date  there have been no interest or penalties charged to us in relation to the underpayment of income taxes 

table of contents we generated net losses since inception through the year ended december  and accordingly did not record a provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we generated net income and as a result recognized an income tax expense of million related to us federal and state alternative minimum tax 
as of december   our total deferred tax assets were million 
the deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue to generate future taxable income to realize these tax assets  a full valuation allowance has been established to offset our deferred tax assets 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future 
we have not yet determined whether such an ownership change has occurred 
if necessary  the deferred tax assets will be reduced by any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as costs associated with our drug discovery efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
research and development expenses are comprised of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party manufacturing organizations  where a substantial portion of our preclinical supplies and all of our clinical supplies are produced  and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and amortization and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
we do not allocate our employee and infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development and the direct  third party research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product candidate 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of current phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion 
the actual timing of completion could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business  we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or commercialize  our product candidates  and if third parties do not manufacture our product candidates in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be delayed sections of risk factors 

table of contents estimated related r d expenses completion of year ended december  product candidate description phase of development current phase in thousands clinical development xp rls phase    xp gerd phase spasticity phase    xp parkinson s disease phase other total clinical development research and preclinical total research and development other constitutes internal clinical development costs for our product candidates that are not directly allocated to xp  xp or xp for the year ended december   other expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million and office and facilities overhead costs of million 
for the year ended december   research and preclinical expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million  office and facilities overhead costs of million and equipment and services costs of million 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in our research and development activities  including the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to increasing headcount  investment in our preclinical development programs and clinical development costs for xp  partially offset by decreasing expenses for our xp phase rls clinical program 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of at least some of our product candidates 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate  the estimated completion date is largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates

we expect our research and development expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to increasing headcount  investment in our preclinical development programs and xp development costs  partially offset by decreasing expenses for our xp phase rls clinical program 
the timing and amount of these increases will primarily depend upon the costs associated with our phase clinical program in rls for xp  our phase clinical trials in gerd and spasticity for xp and the outcomes of current and future clinical trials for xp and xp  as well as the related expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product candidate manufacturing costs

we incurred net operating losses in and and accordingly did not record a provision for income taxes in either of these years 
while recognition of revenues resulted in a profitable year for  we continue to expect to incur losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and seek to advance our product candidates into later stages of development 
as a result  we do not expect to incur income taxes in the next several years 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above due to our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of regulatory agency approvals to sell products  we have generated cumulative operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations primarily through sales of our preferred stock  our initial and follow on public offerings  non equity payments from our collaborators and government grants 
we have received additional funding from capital lease financings and interest earned on investments  each as described more fully below 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including corporate debt securities and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation  and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by operating activities in primarily reflected the net income for the period  and to a lesser extent  adjustments for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities

our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and the extent to which we enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our preclinical testing  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost of manufacturing clinical  and establishing commercial  supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the timing of any milestone payments under our collaborative arrangements  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the terms and timing of any other collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the timing  receipt and amount of sales  profit sharing or royalties  if any  from our potential products  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates  we may delay our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through equity financings  dilution to our stockholders would result 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the united states 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because our investments are short term in duration  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we contract for the conduct of certain manufacturing activities with a contract manufacturer in europe 
we made payments in the aggregate amount of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  to this european contract manufacturer

we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
