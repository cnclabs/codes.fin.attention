item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks factors under item a of this report 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register 
for on line sales  we recognize revenue at the time the customer receives the product 
we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
customers typically receive goods within one week of shipment 
we reflect amounts related to shipping billed to customers in net sales and the related costs in cost of goods sold 
sales tax collected from customers on retail sales are recorded net of retail sales at the time of the transaction 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  we may include additional sales returns in the future 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
we include the value of points and rewards earned by our loyalty program members as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points and rewards are earned based on historical conversion and redemption rates 
the associated revenue is recognized when the rewards are redeemed or expire 
we carry gift certificates sold as a liability and recognize revenue when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
we carry store credits as a liability until redeemed 
we recognize unredeemed store credits and gift certificates as revenue three and four years  respectively  after issuance 
we record royalty revenue from product licensees as earned 
we recognize wholesale licensee revenue from sale of product to international licensee operated bebe stores at the time the licensee receives shipment 
these stores are excluded from comparable store sales 
stock based compensation 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at their fair market value 
we account for stock options and awards issued to employees in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r  stock based awards to employees are required to be recognized as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected term  which affect the calculated values 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we determine market based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued  we review the age and turnover of our inventory and record a reserve if the selling price is marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shrinkage trends 
marketable securities 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars comprised of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  net of an impairment charge of million  which were classified as non current ars 
this amount includes approximately federally insured student loan backed securities and municipal authority bonds 
our ars portfolio is comprised of approximately aaa rated investments  aa rated investments and a rated investments 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for the majority of our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity 
typically the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we determined the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of july  based on an estimated present value using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  underlying assets supporting the ars  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of july  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  of which all was deemed temporary 
an impairment charge was recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
we review our impairments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the condensed consolidated statement of income and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our current intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s estimated fair value 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset 
historically  our impairment charges have been immaterial 
during fiscal  we recorded a  charge for the impairment of store assets 
we did not record an impairment charge during fiscal and during fiscal we recorded charges for the impairment of store assets of  we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
accrued litigation 
we accrue estimates of probable liabilities associated with lawsuits and claims 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
as information becomes available  we assess the potential liabilities related to pending litigation and may revise our estimates as necessary 
such revisions of estimates could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for employee related health care benefits 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of those claims incurred but not reported 
any projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  we may need to adjust reserves in the future 
income taxes 
on july   we adopted fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition issues 
to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company implemented fin as of july  see footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of implementing fin on our financial position and statement of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly does not require any new fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp nos 
and which partially deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for certain non financial assets and liabilities and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope 
we have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements but do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the first saturday after june fiscal  and included  and weeks  respectively

the increase in sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of million generated by stores not included in the comparable store sales base  online sales of million and wholesale sales to international licensees of million 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales and an additional million in sales in fiscal due to the extra week in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin decreased to million for the year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was lower than prior year at primarily due to higher markdowns and unfavorable occupancy leverage  partially offset by higher initial markups

as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increases in compensation  depreciation and advertising 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest and other income resulted from an increase in interest rates primarily on our auction rate securities and additions to our marketable securities balances due to positive operating results partially offset by a decrease in cash and equivalents and investments due to the purchase of million shares of our outstanding stock from our former vice chairperson  neda mashouf  for an aggregate purchase price of provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to an increase in tax exempt interest 
fiscal years ended july  and july  net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended july  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
an increase in comparable store sales of versus the prior year contributed million to the increase in sales 
the remaining increase in sales of million was generated by stores not included in the comparable store sales base and year over year increases in on line sales of million  wholesale sales to international licensees of million and one additional week in fiscal january which totaled million 
the increase in comparable store sales performance was largely due to customer acceptance of our product offering in the first two quarters of the fiscal year 
comparable store sales for the year exclude the additional week in fiscal january net sales included a reduction of million associated with the customer loyalty program in the current year compared to million for the comparable period of the prior year 
gross margin

provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to an increase in tax exempt interest 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the holiday selling season compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at july   we had approximately million of cash and equivalents on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which we could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million  which expires march  as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding  and there were million of letters of credit outstanding 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in net earnings of million and decreases in stock based compensation expense of million and deferred rent of million

net cash provided by investing activities was million  versus net cash used by investing activities of million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of an increase in net proceeds of marketable equity securities of million  partially offset by a decrease in the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million

we opened  and new stores in fiscal  and  respectively  and we expect to open stores in fiscal in fiscal year  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million for new stores and relocation and expansion of existing stores and approximately million for investments in information systems and other capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the average bebe  bebe sport and b bebe new store construction costs before tenant allowances were  and the average gross inventory investment per store was  net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily a result of the purchase of million shares of our outsanding common stock from our former vice chairperson neda mashouf at a price per share of  for an aggregate purchase price of  we completed the purchase and retired the shares during the first quarter of fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from options exercised and the related tax benefit 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal as of july   the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  net of an impairment charge of million  which were classified as non current ars 
this amount includes approximately federally insured student loan backed securities and municipal and education authority bonds 
our ars portfolio is comprised of approximately aaa rated investments  aa rated investments and a rated investments 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for the majority of our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold these ars investments until a recovery of the auction process or until maturity 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments operating leases capital leases trade letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice  usually to days 
we excluded amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above 
the table above does not include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits under fin as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such fin liabilities  the table does not include million of income tax  interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as noncurrent liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet as of july  as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding  and there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain a portfolio of variable interest rate investments consisting of cash equivalents and non current auction rate securities ars  which includes approximately federally insured student loan backed securities and municipal and education authority bonds 
our ars portfolio is comprised of approximately aaa rated investments  aa rated investments and a rated investments 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments are considered short term marketable securities if the original maturity is between three months and twelve months  or long term marketable securities if the original maturity is greater than twelve months 
typically the fair value of ars investments approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we determined the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of july  based on an estimated present value using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  underlying assets supporting the ars  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of july  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  of which all was deemed temporary 
an impairment charge was recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
as of july   we reclassified million of our short term investments to non current ars on our condensed consolidated balance sheet because of our inability to determine when our investments in ars would settle 
we have also modified our current investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments 
an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rate of basis points from levels at july  would cause an additional decline of approximately  or million  in the fair market value of our investments in ars 
the following table lists our cash equivalents and long term marketable securities at july  book value fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate total the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose significantly  our results from operations and cash flows would not be affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states  substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also operate a subsidiary for which the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  assets and liabilities of canada s operations are translated into us dollars at year end rates  while income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholder s equity 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
