item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the uncertainty over the state of the economy due to the high price of oil and the increase of defaults relating to subprime mortgages weighed on the markets in and continues to affect interest in buying stocks 
competition continued to intensify among all types of brokerage firms  including established discount brokers and new firms entering the on line brokerage business 
electronic trading continues to account for an increasing amount of trading activity  with some firms charging very low trading execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet 
some of these brokers  however  impose asset based charges for services such as mailing  transfers and handling exchanges which we do not currently impose  and also direct their orders to market makers where they have a financial interest 
continued competition could limit our growth or even lead to a decline in our customer base  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
industry wide changes in trading practices  such as the continued use of electronic communications networks  are expected to put continuing pressure on commissions fees earned by brokers while increasing volatility 
we entered into an operating agreement  effective as of april  the operating agreement  with suzanne shank and napolean brandford iii  the two individual principals of sbs the principals of sbs financial products company llc  a delaware limited liability company sbsfpc

sbsfpc engages in derivatives transactions related to the municipal underwriting business 
the operating agreement provides that profit and loss will be shared by the principals and by us 
income from sbsfpc is considered to be integral to our operation 
on january   our board of directors authorized a buy back of up to  shares of our common stock 
under this program  shares are purchased from time to time  at our discretion  in the open market and in private transactions 
we  like other securities firms  are directly affected by general economic and market conditions including fluctuations in volume and prices of securities  changes and the prospect of changes in interest rates  and demand for brokerage and investment banking services  all of which can affect our profitability 
in addition  in periods of reduced financial market activity  profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed  including salaries and related costs  portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses 
accordingly  earnings for any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period 
siebert commenced a lawsuit against intuit  inc intuit in seeking expenses and damages arising from the joint brokerage service conducted under the strategic alliance agreement between siebert and intuit 
intuit counterclaimed against siebert for expenses and damages

our management makes significant estimates that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contigent assets and liabilities included in the financial statements 
the estimates relate primarily to revenue and expense items in the normal course of business as to which we receive no confirmations  invoices  or other documentation  at the time the books are closed for a period 
we use our best judgment  based on our knowledge of revenue transactions and expenses incurred  to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses 
we are not aware of any material differences between the estimates used in closing our books for the last five years and the actual amounts of revenue and expenses incurred when we subsequently receive the actual confirmations  invoices or other documentation 
estimates are also used in determining the useful lives of intangibles assets  and the fair market value of intangible assets
