unresolved staff comments one comment remains unresolved as part of a periodic review commenced in by the division of corporation finance of the sec of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  pertaining to the sec s position that we must include the financial statements and summarized financial data of marketing in our periodic filings  which marketing contends is prohibited under the terms of the master lease 
in june  the sec indicated that  unless we file marketing s financial statements and summarized financial data with our periodic reports i it will not consider our annual reports on forms k for the years beginning with to be compliant  ii it will not consider us to be current in our reporting requirements  iii it will not be in a position to declare effective any registration statements we may file for public offerings of our securities  and iv we should consider how the sec s conclusion impacts our ability to make offers and sales of our securities under existing registration statements and if we have a liability for such offers and sales made pursuant to registration statements that did not contain the financial statements of marketing 
we believe that the sec s position is based on their interpretation of certain provisions of their internal accounting disclosure rules and practices training material  staff accounting bulletin no 
and rule of regulation s x 
we do not believe that any of this guidance is clearly applicable to our particular circumstances and we believe that  even if it were  we should be entitled to certain relief from compliance with such requirements 
marketing subleases our properties to approximately eight hundred independent  individual service station convenience store operators subtenants 
consequently  we believe that we  as the owner of these properties and the getty brand  could relet these properties to the existing subtenants who operate their convenience stores  automotive repair services or other businesses at our properties  or to others  at market rents although we cannot accurately predict whether  when  or on what terms  such properties would be re let or sold 
the sec did not accept our positions regarding the inclusion of marketing s financial statements in our filings 
we have had no communication with the sec since regarding the unresolved comment 
we cannot accurately predict the consequences if we are unable to resolve this outstanding comment

the njdep s right to pursue nrds  the viability of defenses to nrds  generally  and the njdep s method for calculating nrds are subject to ongoing litigation in the njdep
