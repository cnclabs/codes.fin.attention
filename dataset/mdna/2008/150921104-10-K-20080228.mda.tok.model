the following should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes located elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and other documents filed by us from time to time with the sec 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel biological therapies for patients with cancer 
we are currently developing cell based cancer immunotherapies and oncolytic virus therapies to treat different types of cancer 
our clinical stage cancer programs involve cell or viral based products that have been modified to impart disease fighting characteristics that are not found in conventional chemotherapeutic agents 
as part of our gvax cancer immunotherapy programs  we are conducting two phase clinical trials in prostate cancer 
we initiated our two phase clinical trials for gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer in july and june  respectively  each under a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
in may  we were granted fast track designation for gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer by the fda 
fast track designation can potentially facilitate development and expedite the review of biologics license applications  or blas 
the first of these two phase clinical trials  referred to as vital  is now fully enrolled 
in january the independent data monitoring committee  or idmc  for vital completed a pre planned interim analysis in the timeframe originally estimated and recommended that the study continue 
in collaboration with investigators at johns hopkins university we are conducting phase trials in pancreatic cancer and phase and phase trials in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome 
in our oncolytic virus therapies program  which we are developing in part through a global alliance with novartis ag  we are conducting a multiple dose phase clinical trial of cg in recurrent bladder cancer 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  income taxes and stock based compensation to be critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived principally from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically includes up front payments  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and license fees 
we evaluate whether the delivered element under these arrangements has value to our 
table of contents customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for the purposes of revenue recognition 
up front payments up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for licenses  technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable up front license fees and other payments under collaboration agreements where we cannot establish standalone value for the delivered license and where we have continuing involvement following the execution of the collaboration agreement  are deferred and recognized on a straight line or ratable method over the period of our continuing involvement unless we determine that another methodology is more appropriate 
during  we recognized revenue from a non refundable up front payment under our global alliance with novartis ag for the development of certain oncolytic virus therapies based upon when the underlying development expenses were incurred  rather than a ratable method  as we determined that the expense method was more appropriate for this agreement 
the revenues recorded under the novartis ag alliance approximated the related development expenses that were incurred in the respective periods 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred  as provided for under the terms of these agreements 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full upon achievement of the incentive milestone events in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner 
as such  the incentive milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of an incentive milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone payment 
license fees non refundable license fees where we have completed all obligations at the execution of the arrangement are recognized as revenue upon execution of the technology licensing agreement when delivery has occurred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or fas  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not recognize any adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and  therefore  implementation of fin did not result in a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit 
at the adoption date of january   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
as a result of a final settlement with the internal revenue service  or irs  during may  unrecognized tax benefits decreased by million in the second quarter of our policy is to account for interest and penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
at the adoption date of january   we had million of accrued interest and zero penalties related to tax contingencies recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had accrued million of interest and zero penalties related to tax contingencies 

table of contents income tax benefits previously recorded have been based on a determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against these deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we considered anticipated future taxable income  and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
certain of these determinations require judgment on the part of management 
if we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is reached 
likewise  if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is reached 
significant estimates are required in determining our income tax benefits 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws and regulations  our future levels of spending for research and development  and changes in our overall level of pre tax earnings or losses 
stock based compensation our operating expenses included the cost of stock based compensation awarded to our employees 
prior to  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
beginning january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or fas r 
under the provisions of fas r  we estimate the fair value of our employee stock based awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider our historical stock option exercise experience including forfeitures  our post vesting termination pattern and the term of the options outstanding 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
fas r requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
accordingly  for the year ended december   we recognized million of stock based compensation expense in operating expenses with an allocation of million to research and development and million to general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of stock based compensation expense in operating expenses with an allocation of million to research and development and million to general and administrative expenses 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized during fiscal year we adopted fas r on a modified prospective basis 
the allocation of employee stock based compensation costs to each operating expense line is estimated based on specific employee headcount information at each grant date and revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual employee headcount information differs materially from those estimates 
as a result  the amount of employee stock based compensation costs we record in future periods in each operating expense line may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options not yet recognized was million  which is expected to be allocated to stock based compensation expense over a weighted average period of months  and total compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units not yet recognized was million  which is expected to be allocated to stock based compensation expense over a weighted average period of seven months 
no compensation expense will be recognized for restricted stock units that do not vest

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  or fas fas defines fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have evaluated the impact of adopting fas on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement  or fas fas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with few exceptions 
fas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have evaluated the impact of adopting fas on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or issue  which addresses the accounting for nonrefundable advance payments 
the eitf concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed 
if an entity s expectations change such that it does not expect it will need the goods to be delivered or the services to be rendered  capitalized nonrefundable advance payments should be charged to expense 
issue is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have evaluated the impact of adopting issue on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect any impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb ratified the final consensuses in emerging issues task force issue no

results of operations revenue revenues were million in  compared to million in and million in the following table shows our revenues by source for the periods indicated in thousands novartis ag sanofi aventis group ceregene  inc other 
table of contents revenues for both and included million in connection with our gene activation technology license agreement with sanofi aventis group for gene activated erythropoietin  compared to revenues of million in which included million in milestone revenue under the same agreement 
we recorded contract revenue of  in compared to million in both and for services provided to ceregene of which we own a minority position 
revenues for included million from novartis ag in connection with our global alliance for the development and commercialization of oncolytic virus therapies 
there was no revenue in and from novartis ag as the million payment was fully recognized by december  research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these increases can be attributed to the increase in phase clinical activities for our gvax immunotherapy program for prostate cancer in europe  our expansion in clinical trials and other product development activities in both our gvax cancer immunotherapy and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
research and development expenses included million in  and million in  in non cash stock based compensation expense related to fas r 
in july  we announced the commencement of our vital trial  which compares gvax prostate cancer immunotherapy to taxotere chemotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer without cancer related pain 
in june  we announced the commencement of our vital trial  which compares gvax prostate cancer immunotherapy plus taxotere chemotherapy to taxotere chemotherapy alone in advanced prostate cancer patients with cancer related pain 
we continue to deploy the majority of our research and development resources to advance gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer 
expenses related to gvax immunotherapy for leukemia  gvax immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer  the oncolytic virus therapy cg and other potential product candidates in preclinical studies are a minor proportion of our spending 
we expect that our research and development expenditures and headcount will remain approximately at current levels in the near term 
however  this depends on a number of factors  including progress in research and development and clinical trials 
biopharmaceutical products  such as those being developed by us  may take to years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind application  which  if successful  allows for a clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and costs for each phase are generally larger than the preceding phase  as the size of the clinical trial number of patients grows 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have one product in development for which we have initiated phase studies 
however  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
estimates of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
completion of clinical trials  including the vital and vital trials that we initiated in july and june  respectively  may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
however  we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are usually completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years many factors may delay our commencement and speed of completion of clinical trials  including the size and number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up required  the number of clinical 
table of contents sites at which the trial is conducted  competing trials and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda or a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
there can be no assurance that any approval required by the fda or other regulatory body will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see item a 
risk factors above 
included below is a summary of products and the related stage of development for each product in clinical development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of ongoing phase constitutes forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
our estimates of timing of completion of these trials are based on typical times of completion for trials of that type at such phases of development 
the actual timing of completion of these phases of our clinical trials could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table due to the number of patients enrolled in the trial  the number of clinical trial sites involved  the time needed to fully enroll the trial  the time required for patient follow up and other factors 
longer time frames for the completion of certain trials may be the result of requirements to measure patient survival 
in addition  it is possible that any of these ongoing clinical trials may never be completed due to the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related side effects  lack of clinical efficacy  insufficient supply of product for these clinical trials and other factors 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see item a 
risk factors above 
treatment phase of development estimated completion of ongoing phase gvax cancer immunotherapies prostate cancer phase pancreatic cancer phase leukemia phase oncolytic virus therapy cg recurrent bladder cancer phase general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  including non cash  stock based compensation  for employees in executive and operational functions  including finance  legal  information technology  human resources and business development 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to is primarily due to the continuing increase in infrastructure costs associated with product development and other business activities 
the increase in compared to is primarily due to recording million in of non cash stock based compensation expense related to adoption of fas r 
future spending for general and administrative costs is expected to remain approximately at current levels in the near term 
restructuring charges in june  we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring of our business operations to focus resources on our most advanced and most promising product development programs 
in november  we sold our san diego  california  manufacturing facility for viral products to genzyme corporation for 
table of contents million 
we recorded a charge of million in related to our restructuring decisions  including million for workforce reduction initiatives  million to reduce the carrying value of the san diego manufacturing facility and million for lease termination and other expenses 
during  we decreased the restructuring accrual by million due to the extension of a sublease  and paid all remaining obligations 
gain on sale of abgenix common stock during  we sold all of our remaining million shares of abgenix common stock for a gain of million 
during  we recorded a gain of million associated with our sale of million shares of abgenix common stock 
interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared to million in and million in the increases are primarily attributed to higher average cash and short term investment balances 
in addition  we received million from laboratoire serono sa  or serono  for our agreement to withdraw from a patent dispute between us and serono relating to gene activation technology in december the amount of this settlement is included in interest and other income in interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in in october and november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due in and used a portion of those proceeds to repay bank debt totaling million 
we recorded interest expense related to our convertible senior notes  including amortization of related debt issuance costs  of million in each of  and in addition  we recorded interest expense associated with our south san francisco  california capital lease obligation of million in  million in and million in income taxes in july  the irs issued a notice of proposed adjustment  or nopa  seeking to disallow million of net operating losses that we deducted for the fiscal year and seeking a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in the year ended december  we responded to the irs in september  disagreeing with the conclusions reached by the irs in the nopa and seeking to resolve this matter with the appeals office of the irs 
in may  we reached final settlement regarding this matter with the irs in the amount of million with respect to the fiscal years ended december   and this amount was comprised of million in federal tax and million in related interest 
no penalty was assessed 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in compared to a tax provision of million in and million in the tax benefit recorded for the year ended december  is related to the reversal of million of previously accrued income taxes as a result of the final settlement with the irs  in may  offset by additional accrued interest for tax contingencies 
the tax provision in relates to a realized gain on the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock and million related to additional interest recorded for tax contingencies 
the tax provision recorded in relates to the realized gain on the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock and million of additional interest for tax contingencies  partially offset by tax benefits related to unrealized gains on abgenix common stock 
it is reasonably possible that we will close certain years to examination under the relevant statute of limitations which may further decrease our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million 
table of contents in the next months 
we file tax returns in the us  us and california 
in general  the years through  remain open to examination for us and us purposes  and through for california purposes 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million which will expire in the years beginning through if not utilized 
deferred revenue in december  we sold for million all of our assets  intellectual property and previously established licensing agreements relating to our lentiviral gene delivery technology  commonly referred to as lentiviral vectors to gbp ip  llc  an affiliate of gbp capital  the majority shareholder in privately held lentigen corporation 
we received full payment of million in december as part of the sales agreement we retained our rights to use the technology for research and development purposes including potential future use with our cancer immunotherapy products 
we applied eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in evaluating the appropriate accounting for this agreement 
we identified the delivery of biological materials including certain gmp compliant materials  intellectual property and previously established licensing agreements related to our lentiviral gene delivery technology as the primary deliverables under this sales agreement and concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting based upon the determination that these deliverables did not have stand alone value and can not be separated 
therefore  we have deferred recognition of revenue until we have performed all of our obligations under the agreement which we expect to complete during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which million was classified as restricted and was related to letters of credit for our corporate headquarters facility in south san francisco  california and our cgmp manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
information regarding the classification of these assets is included in note  investments of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
we have maintained our financial position through strategic management of our resources including access to debt and equity financing  funding from various corporate collaborations and licensing agreements  and the sale of abgenix common stock 
equity financing in february  our shelf registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec under the securities act  which allowed us to offer up to million of securities on short notice in one or more public offerings registered under the securities act 
we used this shelf registration in march to complete a public offering of million shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we next used this shelf registration in september to complete an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in april  we used the remaining registered amount under this shelf registration to raise net proceeds of million in a registered direct offering of million shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share from selected institutional investors 
these warrants are exercisable beginning october  for a period of four and a half years thereafter

under certain circumstances  we may redeem some or all of the convertible senior notes on or after november  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
the notes are convertible into our common stock  initially at the conversion price of per share  equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustments for stock dividends  stock splits and other similar events 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used in compared to is primarily due to the one time receipt of million from the sale of our intellectual property in december  partially offset by the increased costs associated with phase clinical activities in europe 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower costs resulting from the strategic restructuring of our business operations and exit payments made in we expect cash requirements for operating activities to remain approximately at current levels in the near term 
the timing of cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials  obligations related to our existing manufacturing and headquarter facilities  and future requirements to establish commercial capabilities for any products that we may develop 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and million in net cash provided by investing activities in decreased by million compared to primarily due to purchases of short term investments exceeding maturities of short term investments in as compared to capital expenditures of million in were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment

operating leases we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
these leases  including the hayward and memphis facility leases  expire at various dates through  and some contain options for renewal 
our south san francisco headquarters facility lease is recorded as a capital lease as a result of certain amendments that required us to fund the costs of certain structural components of the facility 
in may  we sold a portion of our leasehold improvements and equipment located in our memphis facility for million in cash 
these leasehold improvements and equipment related to manufacturing activities that are no longer being carried out at this facility 
additionally  we amended our existing lease for the memphis facility with the landlord and the buyer entered into a separate lease with the landlord for a majority portion of the facility 
we continue to lease the remaining portion of the facility for our product distribution center 
the net book value of the assets sold was million  resulting in a gain on sale of million 
in november  in connection with the sale of our san diego  california  manufacturing facility for viral products to genzyme corporation and the termination of the related facility leases  we retired million of leasehold improvements and manufacturing assets and million of related accumulated depreciation 
also  in november  we terminated the lease for our former corporate headquarters facility in foster city  california  and retired million of associated leasehold improvements  equipment and related accumulated depreciation 

table of contents our long term contractual obligations at december  were as follows payment due total and and and thereafter in thousands convertible senior notes and related interest south san francisco capital lease obligation operating leases under certain circumstances  we may redeem some or all of the convertible senior notes on or after november  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
the notes are convertible into our common stock  initially at the conversion price of per share  equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustments for stock dividends  stock splits and other similar events 
we estimate that our cash to be used in operating activities during will be approximately million to million 
this estimated use of cash excludes capital expenditures and the cost of any potential acquisitions  and does not reflect the potential offset by equity or debt financings or major new collaborative ventures or potential proceeds from the ceff 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development  clinical  manufacturing and commercialization activities  our ability to establish new collaborations and the terms of those collaborations  competing technological and market developments  the time and cost of regulatory approvals  and various other factors that we discuss under item a 
risk factors above 
our ongoing development programs and any increase in the number and size of programs and trials and proportion of patients enrolled outside north america will reduce our current cash resources and potentially create further need to raise additional capital 
therefore  we will continue to consider financing alternatives including collaborative ventures and potential equity and debt financings
