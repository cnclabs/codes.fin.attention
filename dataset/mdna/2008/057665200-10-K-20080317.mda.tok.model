critical accounting policies management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss  and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
in addition  the company follows the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
revenue related to a process and product license agreement is recognized using the percentage of completion method and the progress to completion is measured using the efforts expended method 
the company follows the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized as work is performed and costs are incurred 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a product exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and or when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement were applied prospectively for inventory costs incurred beginning in our fiscal year the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of its goodwill to its carrying value 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  china and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
post employment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
on december   we recorded as a reduction to the benefit obligation and  net of tax  as a one time adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
beginning in fiscal  we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing the financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosures 
the application of fin requires judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of the options is based on the company s historical experience of employees exercise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we recorded of compensation expense  net of tax  in if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
under the accounting method we followed prior to january   we did not record any stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees and directors for the year ended december  if we had included the cost of employee stock option compensation in the financial statements for the year ended december  our net earnings would have decreased by approximately  based on the fair value of the stock options granted to employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
the purpose of issuing the statement is to replace current guidance in sfas no 
to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction 
the changes to be effected with sfas r from the current guidance include  but are not limited to acquisition costs will be recognized separately from the acquisition  known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value  all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability  contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition  business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as noncontrolling interests  in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values  and a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
sfas r will be effective for any business combinations that occur after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas was issued to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way  that is  as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  sfas eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas will be effective january  the company is currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on its financial statements and disclosures 
in june  fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf will be effective for us beginning on january  the company is currently evaluating the effect of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on january  fin clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by a taxing authority 
additional information regarding fin is included in note in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective beginning in january the company is evaluating whether adoption of this statement will result in a change to its fair value measurements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market accounts 
accordingly  we believe we have limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  nor does the company have any financial instruments entered into for trading or hedging purposes 
as of december   the company s borrowings were under a bank term loan bearing interest at libor plus  a second bank term loan bearing interest at euribor plus  a revolving line of credit bearing interest at libor plus and a second revolving line of credit bearing interest at euribor plus 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  applied to the company s borrowings at december   would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense and a corresponding reduction or increase in cash flow of approximately the company is exposed to market risks for changes in foreign currency rates and has exposure to commodity price risks  including prices of our primary raw materials 
our objective is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and raw material pricing arising in our business activities 
the company manages these financial exposures  where possible  through pricing and operational means 
our practices may change as economic conditions change
