as such  the units of accounting are based on each individual product and service sold  and revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for each individual product and service is based on separate individual prices of these products and services

contracts the company recognizes revenue in its government segment using the guidance from sec sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the company s contract revenues generated by the government segment result primarily from contract services performed for the us government under a variety of cost plus fixed fee  time and material  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized based on allowable costs for labor hours delivered  as well as other allowable costs plus the applicable fee 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized by multiplying the number of direct labor hours delivered in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other direct costs as incurred

while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
thus  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required

the benefit recognized for a tax position meeting the more likely than not criterion is measured based on the largest benefit that is more than percent likely to be realized 
the measurement of the related benefit is determined by considering the probabilities of the amounts that could be realized upon ultimate settlement  assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts and including expected negotiated settlements with the taxing authority
