item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the nation s leading specialty retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories 
we began operations in and at august   operated  stores in the united states and puerto rico  and in mexico 
each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars  sport utility vehicles  vans and light trucks  including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and non automotive products 
in many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local  regional and national repair garages  dealers and service stations 
we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software 
on the web  we sell diagnostic and repair information and automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and non automotive products through www 
autozone 
com 
we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation 
executive summary autozone achieved a solid performance in fiscal delivering record earnings of million and sales growth of million over the prior year 
we completed the fiscal year with solid growth in our commercial sales and an increase in our retail sales 
we are encouraged by the increase in our commercial business and remain focused on strengthening our retail business 
we believe the challenging macro environment  including increases in gas prices  the credit crisis and higher unemployment  has impacted our customers 
based on the current macro environment  we continue to communicate to our customers our extensive product categories that are focused on improving gas mileage and saving money by performing maintenance on their vehicles 
we believe the two statistics that have the closest correlation to our market growth are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 
miles driven declined for the ninth straight month in july august data is not yet available 
we believe higher gas prices have contributed to these trends 
conversely  the number of older vehicles seven years old or older on the road has continued to increase annually 
we currently do not believe the combined impact of these trends to be material to our business 
key initiatives during fiscal  we continued to reinforce the importance of improving the customer shopping experience by focusing on continuous training on product knowledge  leadership and most importantly  our culture of customer satisfaction 
additionally  we made steady progress on our category management initiatives by making enhancements to our merchandise assortment planning tools  updating category line reviews  expanding our parts assortment  and increasing retail prices to help mitigate the exposure to our business from increased costs 
also  we maintained our focus on commercial sales training to develop a first class commercial field sales organization 
lastly  we continued to gain traction on our new electronic parts catalogue  z net  by improving its capabilities and highlighting this customer service enhancement in our marketing campaign 
we continue to see our customers being more cautious with their buying habits in the midst of a challenging environment  however  we believe we are well positioned moving into fiscal and are confident we can continue offering a value proposition that is compelling to our customers 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal for the year ended august   autozone reported net sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal this growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of open stores  a increase from the addition of the rd week and domestic same store sales increase of

alldata and mexico sales increased over prior year  contributing percentage points of the total increase in net sales 

table of contents gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was due to the positive impact of category management efforts  partially offset by increased distribution expense relating to higher fuel costs 
vendor funding is primarily recorded as a reduction to inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold  however  vendor funding for specific selling activities is recorded as a reduction to operating  selling  general and administrative expenses 
historically  we have classified the majority of our funding as a reduction to inventory  however  during the current year we began to transition to more specific promotions and selling activities as we increased our efforts with vendors to develop tactics to allow them to drive sales and showcase their product  which affect selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal the increase of operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to higher employee medical expense and fuel expense for our commercial fleet 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower short term rates and was offset by higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the impact of the additional week in the current fiscal year 
average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal weighted average borrowing rates were at august   compared to at august  our effective income tax rate was of pre tax income for fiscal compared to for fiscal refer to note d income taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate

domestic same store sales  or sales for domestic stores open at least one year  increased from the prior year 
gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales  for fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to ongoing category management initiatives and supply chain efficiencies 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal the increase in expenses is driven primarily by higher occupancy cost versus the prior year 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this increase was due to higher short term rates and higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and the recognition of interest expense on capital lease obligations that were accounted for as operating leases prior to a modification to the lease agreements in fiscal average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal weighted average borrowing rates were at august   compared to at august  
table of contents our effective income tax rate decreased to of pre tax income for fiscal as compared to for fiscal primarily due to benefits from changes in our pre tax earnings mix and an increase in certain federal and state tax credits 
refer to note d income taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate 
net income for fiscal increased to million  and diluted earnings per share increased to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately seasonality and quarterly periods autozone s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months of march through september  in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about to higher than in the slower months of december through february 
during short periods of time  a store s sales can be affected by weather conditions 
extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products 
mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather 
over the longer term  the effects of weather balance out  as we have stores throughout the united states and mexico 
each of the first three quarters of autozone s fiscal year consisted of weeks  and the fourth quarter consisted of weeks in and weeks in and because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of or weeks  compared with weeks for each of the first three quarters  our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year  containing weeks  represented of annual sales and of net income  the fourth quarter of fiscal  containing weeks  represented of annual sales and of net income  and the fourth quarter of fiscal  containing weeks  represented of annual sales and of net income 
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase over prior year was primarily due to the growth in net income and to a lesser extent  timing of income tax deductions  and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors continue to finance a large portion of our inventory 
partially offsetting this increase was higher accounts receivable 
we have maintained an accounts payable to inventory ratio of at august   at august   and at august  autozone s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program 
from the beginning of fiscal to august   we have opened net new stores 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we invested million in capital assets in fiscal  compared to million in capital assets in fiscal  and million in capital assets in fiscal new store openings were for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal we invest a portion of our assets held by the company s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities 
we acquired million of marketable securities in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we had proceeds from matured marketable securities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital asset disposals provided million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the treasury stock purchases in fiscal  and were primarily funded by cash flow from operations  and at times  by increases in debt levels 
proceeds from issuance of debt reflected million for fiscal  none for fiscal and million for fiscal debt repayments totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as discussed in note f  in august  we issued million in senior notes due and million in senior notes due a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of debt was used to repay outstanding commercial paper  which had increased for the repayment of the million senior notes that matured in july 
we intend to use the remainder of the proceeds to redeem or repurchase existing debt  for working capital needs  for capital expenditures  for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes 
net repayments of commercial paper were million for fiscal and million for fiscal for fiscal  net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were million 

table of contents we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal  primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and systems 
in addition to the building and land costs  our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers  reducing the working capital required 
we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases  however  our ability to do so may be impacted by a prolonged tightening of the credit markets which may directly limit our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us 
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions  we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures  working capital requirements and stock repurchases 
the balance may be funded through new borrowings 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 
credit ratings at august   autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a moody s investors service had assigned the company a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa and a commercial paper rating of p fitch ratings assigned the company a bbb rating for senior unsecured debt and an f rating for commercial paper 
as of august   moody s  standard poor s and fitch had autozone listed as having a stable outlook 
if our credit ratings drop  our interest expense may increase  similarly  we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised 
if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels  we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will likely increase  as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade  our access to financing may become more limited 
debt facilities we maintain billion of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks to primarily support commercial paper borrowings  letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans 
the credit facilities may be increased to billion at autozone s election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval  may include up to million in letters of credit  and may include up to million in capital leases 
as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit  the company had million in available capacity under these facilities at august  the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of bank of america s base rate or a eurodollar rate each as defined in the facility agreements  or a combination thereof 
these facilities expire in may our million bank term loan entered in december was amended in april to have similar terms and conditions as the billion credit facilities  but with a december maturity  and was further amended in august to reduce the interest rate on eurodollar loans 
that credit agreement with a group of banks provides for a term loan  which consists of  at our election  base rate loans  eurodollar loans or a combination thereof 
the interest accrues on base rate loans at a base rate per annum equal to the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage  which can range from basis points to basis points  depending upon our senior unsecured non credit enhanced long term debt rating 
based on our ratings at august   the applicable percentage on eurodollar loans is basis points 
we may select interest periods of one  two  three or six months for eurodollar loans  subject to availability 
interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period  but no less frequently than quarterly 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december   to effectively fix  based on current debt ratings  the interest rate of the term loan at 
we have the option to extend loans into subsequent interest period s or convert them into loans of another interest rate type 
the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan will be due and payable in full on december   when the facility terminates 
we may prepay the term loan in whole or in part at any time without penalty  subject to reimbursement of the lenders breakage and redeployment costs in the case of prepayment of eurodollar borrowings 

table of contents on june   we entered into an agreement with esl investments  inc  setting forth certain understandings and agreements see exhibit for complete details regarding the voting by esl investments  inc  on behalf of itself and its affiliates collectively  esl  of certain shares of common stock of autozone  inc and related matters 
among other things  we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to increase our adjusted debt ebitdar target ratio from to no later than february  we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt  capital lease obligations and rent times six  and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and options expenses to net income 
during july  our million senior notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper 
on august   we issued million in senior notes due and million in senior notes due under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  we used a portion of the proceeds to pay down our commercial paper and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
during april  our million senior notes maturing at that time were repaid with an increase in commercial paper 
on june   we issued million in senior notes due under our existing shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on august  that shelf registration allowed us to sell up to million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt  and for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
the remainder of the shelf registration was cancelled in february  the and notes issued during august   are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded and a provision where repayment of the notes may be accelerated if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements 
our borrowings under our other senior notes arrangements contain minimal covenants  primarily restrictions on liens 
under our other borrowing arrangements  covenants include limitations on total indebtedness  restrictions on liens  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances 
all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 
as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants 
stock repurchases during  we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors 
the program was amended in june to increase the repurchase authorization to billion from billion 
from january to august   we have repurchased a total of million shares at an aggregate cost of billion 
we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal  million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal  and million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal on september   the board of directors raised the repurchase authorization from billion to billion 
from august  to october   we repurchased million shares for million

these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based on actuarial calculations 
although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities  the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns 
accordingly  the company reflects the net present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance sheets 
we have other obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities or due to the nature of the account

the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year  but have automatic renewal clauses 
in conjunction with our commercial sales program  we offer credit to some of our commercial customers

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value 
non gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures  or considered in isolation  for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance  financial position or cash flows 
however  we have presented the non gaap financial measures  as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company s comparative year to year operating results 
furthermore  our management and compensation committee of the board of directors use the abovementioned non gaap financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance based compensation

the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation pbo of the plan 
refer to note i  pension and savings plans for further description of this adoption 
additionally  sfas requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor s year end

the adoption of this statement is not expected to have an immediate material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this new standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas will be effective for autozone in fiscal the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we do not currently intend to elect to apply fair value to any financial instruments that are not already reported at fair value

sfas no 
is effective days after the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section critical accounting policies preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 
our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sales we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method 
included in inventory are related purchasing  storage and handling costs 
due to price deflation on the company s merchandise purchases  the company s inventory balances are effectively maintained under the first in  first out method as the company s policy is not to write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments  resulting in cost of sales being reflected at the higher amount 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs 
additionally  we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrinkage 
our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by ongoing physical inventory counts 
vendor allowances autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements 
monies received from vendors include rebates  allowances and promotional funds 
the amounts to be received are subject to purchase volumes and the terms of the vendor agreements  which generally do not state an expiration date  but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions  vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise 
rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product  but only if it is reasonably certain that the required volume levels will be reached 
these monies are recorded as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
allowances and promotional funds earned under vendor funding programs are accounted for pursuant to the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf 
the majority of the vendor funds received is recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 
for arrangements that provide for reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor s products  the vendor funds are recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which the specific costs were incurred 

table of contents impairments in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets  such as property and equipment  covered by this standard annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists 
we perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
if impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations  the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss 
such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed  which could differ from actual results 
self insurance we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation  vehicle  employee health  general and product liability and property losses  and we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks 
liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported 
through various methods  which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of actuaries  the company estimates the costs of these risks 
the long term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value 
we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  although actual losses may differ from the amounts provided 
income taxes we accrue and pay income taxes based on the tax statutes  regulations and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
income tax expense involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax matters in dispute with state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
we measure and record income tax contingency accruals in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management 
these reevaluations are based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  successfully settled issues under audit  expirations due to statues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual 
we classify interest related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense  and if applicable  penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
the income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities 
the remaining portion of our income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are presented as noncurrent liabilities because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date 
these noncurrent income tax liabilities are recorded in the caption other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
litigation and other contingent liabilities we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business  such as employment matters  product liability claims and general liability claims related to our store premises 
we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities 

table of contents pension obligation prior to january   substantially all full time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan 
the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation 
on january   the plan was frozen 
accordingly  pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
on january   the company s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen 
accordingly  plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
as the plan benefits are frozen  the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels  but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances i 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets estimated by considering the composition of our asset portfolio  our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions

discount rate used to determine benefit obligations adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date may using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities 
this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year 
if such assumptions differ materially from actual experience  the impact could be material to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk autozone is exposed to market risk from  among other things  changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
from time to time  we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks 
to date  based upon our current level of foreign operations  hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates  no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk 
all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors 
further  we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk autozone s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates 
at times  we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts  treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps 
autozone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances 
we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets 
all of the company s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 
we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a fair value of million at august   and million at august   to effectively fix the interest rate on the million term loan entered into during december the related gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
the company s hedge instrument was determined to be highly effective as of august  
table of contents the fair value of our debt was estimated at billion as of august   and billion as of august   based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt having the same remaining maturities 
such fair value is less than the carrying value of debt by million at august   and less than the carrying value of debt by million at august  considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge  we had no variable rate debt outstanding at august   and million of variable rate debt outstanding at august  in fiscal  at this borrowing level for variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of million  which includes the effects of the interest rate swap 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 
considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge  we had outstanding fixed rate debt of billion at august   and billion at august  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by million at august   and million at august  fuel price risk fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel and unleaded fuel exposure 
we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the or fiscal years 
during fiscal we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure 
these swaps were settled within a few days of the fiscal year end and had no significant impact on cost of sales for the fiscal year
