item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements congress passed the private securities litigation act of to encourage corporations to provide investors with information about the company s anticipated future financial performance  goals  and strategies 
the act provides a safe haven for such disclosure  in other words  protection from unwarranted litigation if actual results are not the same as management expectations 
united desires to provide its shareholders with sound information about past performance and future trends 
consequently  any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of united in this report  in any other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by united s statements for a variety of factors including  but not limited to changes in economic conditions  movements in interest rates  competitive pressures on product pricing and services  success and timing of business strategies  the nature and extent of governmental actions and reforms  and rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards 
introduction the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in financial condition and the results of operations of united and its subsidiaries for the periods indicated below 
this discussion and the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of united bankshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated 
on july   united acquired of the outstanding common stock of premier community bankshares  inc premier of winchester  virginia 
the results of operations of premier  which are not significant  are included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
however  comparisons for the year of to the year of are impacted by increased levels of reported average balance sheet  income  expense  and the credit quality results due to the acquisition 
in addition  united incurred merger expenses and related integration costs of million for the year of due to the premier acquisition which are included in other noninterest expense in united s consolidated statements of income 
at consummation  premier had assets of approximately million  loans of million  deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
the transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
prior to july   united operated two main business segments community banking and mortgage banking 
as previously reported  on july   united sold its wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiary  george mason mortgage  llc mason mortgage 
united s mortgage banking activities were conducted primarily through mason mortgage  which was previously reported as a separate segment 
for the years prior to  mason mortgage is shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
since the sale of mason mortgage  united s operations relate mainly to community banking which offers customers traditional banking products and services  including loan and deposit products  and wealth management services which include investment banking  financial planning  trust and brokerage services 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
application of critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of united conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the financial statement notes and in this financial review  
table of contents provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and the valuation of retained interests in securitized financial assets to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by united are presented in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of estimated future cash flows  estimated losses on pools of loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which are susceptible to constant and significant change 
in determining the components of the allowance for credit losses  management considers the risk arising in part from  but not limited to  charge off and delinquency trends  current economic and business conditions  lending policies and procedures  the size and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  concentrations of credit  and other various factors 
the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses is described in note a  notes to consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of the factors leading to changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of concentrations of credit risk  see item  under the caption of loan concentrations in this form k 
united uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the valuation of these derivative instruments is considered critical because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are provided by third party sources 
because the majority of the derivative instruments are used to protect the value of other assets and liabilities on the balance sheet  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are typically offset by changes in the value of the assets and liabilities being hedged  although income statement volatility can occur if the derivative instruments are not effective in hedging changes in the value of those assets and liabilities 
united s calculation of income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of united s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to tax laws and regulations that may affect the transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
united strives to keep abreast of changes in the tax laws and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
united is also subject to audit by federal and state authorities 
because the application of tax laws is subject to varying interpretations  results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from united s estimates and provisions 
united continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of probable exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is further discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets

provision for credit losses united s credit quality continues to be sound  comparing favorably to peer group averages despite an increase in nonperforming loans for the year 
nonperforming loans were million or of loans  net of unearned income  at december  compared to million or of loans  net of unearned income at december  the increase from year end was due largely to nonperforming loans of million added from the former premier offices  the addition of million of loans to four customers being placed on nonaccrual status as well as the addition of certain residential real estate construction credits originated by a former united loan officer with an outstanding balance of million being either plus days delinquent or on nonaccrual status as of december  the components of nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans that are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  but have not been put on a nonaccrual basis 
at year end  nonaccrual loans were million  a net increase of million or from million at year end significant additions as of year end were million of nonaccrual loans from the former premier 
table of contents offices  million of nonaccrual loans to the four customers mentioned above and million of residential real estate construction credits originated by the former united loan officer mentioned above 
loans past due days or more were million at december   a net increase of million or from million at year end premier added million in loans past due days or more 
otherwise  the additional increase in past due days or more was due mainly to the addition of one commercial credit with an outstanding balance of million at december  the loss potential on these loans has been properly evaluated and allocated in the company s allowance for credit losses 
total nonperforming assets of million  including oreo of million at december   represented of total assets at the end of the year which compares favorably to united s most recently reported peer group banking companies bank holding companies with total assets between and billion percentage of 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and real estate acquired in foreclosure or other settlement of loans oreo 
management is not aware of any other significant loans or securities  groups of loans or securities  or segments of the loan or investment portfolio not included below or disclosed elsewhere herein where there are serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers or issuers to comply with the present repayment terms of the debt 
the following table summarizes nonperforming assets for the indicated periods 
december in thousands nonaccrual loans loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal  and are still accruing interest total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans are designated as impaired when  in the opinion of management  the collection of principal and interest in accordance with the loan contract is doubtful 
at december   impaired loans were million  which was a net increase of million or from the million in impaired loans at december  significant additions to impaired loans at year end were million from the former premier offices  million from two large collateralized commercial credits and million from the above mentioned certain residential real estate construction credits 
charge offs of million were recognized on the real estate construction credits during the year of  which were previously reported as impaired with specific allowances allocated in the company s allowance for credit losses 
based on the current information and events  united believes it is probable that the borrowers will not be able to repay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements and therefore  specific allowances in the company s allowance for credit losses have been allocated for all of these loans 
for further details on impaired loans  see note e  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united maintains an allowance for loan losses and an allowance for lending related commitments 
the combined allowances for loan losses and lending related commitments are referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  compared to million at december  as a percentage of loans  net of unearned income  the allowance for credit losses was and at december  and  respectively

united evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and its loan administration policies are focused upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
united s process for evaluating the allowance is a formal company wide process that focuses on early identification of potential problem credits and procedural discipline in managing and accounting for those credits 
this process determines the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses  allocation among loan types and 
table of contents lending related commitments  and the resulting provision for credit losses 
allocations are made for specific commercial loans based upon management s estimate of the borrowers ability to repay and other factors impacting collectibility 
other commercial loans not specifically reviewed on an individual basis are evaluated based on historical loss percentages applied to loan pools that have been segregated by risk 
allocations for loans other than commercial loans are made based upon historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions 
the allowance for credit losses includes estimated probable inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates  and risk factors that have not yet fully manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
in addition  a portion of the allowance accounts for the inherent imprecision in the allowance for credit losses analysis 
over the past several years  united has grown through acquisition  and accordingly  expanded the geographic area in which it operates 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish allocation estimates might not precisely correspond to the current portfolio in these other geographic areas 
the following table presents the allocation of united s allowance for credit losses for each of the five years ended december december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate real estate construction consumer and other lending related commitments allowance for estimated imprecision less allowance for credit losses  discontinued operations total united s formal company wide process at december  produced increased allocations in three of the four loan categories 
the components of the allowance allocated to commercial loans increased by million due the impact of the acquired loans from premier  increased loan outstandings net of the acquisition  an increase in classified loans and higher specific allocations on impaired loans 
consumer loans increased thousand also as a result of the acquisition 
the real estate construction loan pool allocations rose during year by million primarily due to the acquisition and a new special allocation of thousand related to the single family residential construction loan pool 
the components of the allowance allocated to real estate loans decreased by thousand due to reductions in high loan to value outstandings  as well as changes in qualitative factors 
the unfunded commitments liability decreased by thousand and stood at million 
an allowance is established for probable credit losses on impaired loans via specific allocations 
nonperforming commercial loans and leases are regularly reviewed to identify impairment 
a loan or lease is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts contractually due 
measuring impairment of a loan requires judgment and estimates  and the eventual outcomes may differ from those estimates 
impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the selected measure is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment has occurred 
the allowance for impaired 
table of contents loans was million at december  and million at december  compared to the prior year end  this element of the allowance increased by thousand due to the combination of the premier acquisition and higher specific allocations in the commercial and real estate construction and development loan pools 
an allowance is also recognized for imprecision inherent in loan loss migration models and other estimates of loss 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending related commitments  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its methodology for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors to identify and quantify probable losses in the portfolio  the process includes subjective elements and is therefore susceptible to change 
this estimate for imprecision has been established to recognize the variance  within a reasonable margin  of the loss estimation process 
the estimate for imprecision decreased at december  by thousand to million 
this represents only of the bank s total allowance for credit loss and in as much as this variance approximates a pre determined narrow parameter  the methodology has confirmed that the bank s allowance for credit loss is at an appropriate level 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses on existing loans and lending related commitments based on information currently available 
management is not aware of any potential problem loans  trends or uncertainties that it reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources which have not been disclosed 
additionally  management has disclosed all known material credits that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment schedules 
other income other income consists of all revenues  which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for improving united s profitability 
recognizing the importance  management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced 
noninterest income was million for the year of  up million or from the year of included in total noninterest income for the year of was an million before tax loss on the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances as compared to a before tax loss of million for the year of additionally  united s income from investment security transactions increased million for the year of as compared to the same period last year as united incurred a net loss on security transactions of million in the first quarter of due to an other than temporary impairment on approximately million of low yielding fixed rate investment securities which united subsequently sold as part of a balance sheet repositioning 
excluding the results of the interest rate swap terminations and investment security transactions  noninterest income for the year of would have increased million or from the year of the rise in noninterest income in the year of from the same period in was due in large part to an increase of million or in fees from deposit services mainly as a result of united s high performance checking program and the premier acquisition 
in particular  insufficient funds nsf fees and check card fees increased million or and million or  respectively  for the year of as compared to the same period in partially offsetting these increases were decreases in deposit service charges and account analysis fees of thousand and thousand  respectively 
trust income and brokerage commissions increased million or due to a greater volume of business and a larger customer base 
united continues its efforts to broaden the scope and activity of its trust and brokerage service areas  especially in the northern virginia market  to provide additional sources of fee income that complement united s traditional banking products and services 
the northern virginia market provides a relatively large number of potential customers with high per capita incomes 
mortgage banking income decreased thousand or due to fewer mortgage loan sales in the secondary market during the year of as compared to mortgage loan sales were million in as compared to million in for the year  income from bank owned life insurance policies increased thousand or due mainly to an increase in cash surrender value while fees from bankcard transactions increased thousand or due 
table of contents to increased volume compared to the year of other income increased thousand or for the year of as compared to last year s income during the same period 
income from the outsourcing of official checks processing for the year of increased thousand over the same period last year 
other expense just as management continues to evaluate areas where noninterest income can be enhanced  it strives to improve the efficiency of its operations to reduce costs 
other expense includes all items of expense other than interest expense  the provision for credit losses and income tax expense 
noninterest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of results for the year of included merger expenses and related integration costs of the premier acquisition of million 
results for the year of and both included penalties to prepay fhlb advances 
united incurred before tax penalties of million and million to prepay fhlb advances during the year of and  respectively 
salaries and benefits expense for the year of increased million or from the year of salaries increased million or due mainly to the additional employees from the premier merger while benefits expense decreased million or due to a decrease of million in pension expense 
during the third quarter of  united made a significant contribution to its pension plan as allowed by the pension protection act of this large contribution resulted in decreased pension expense for united in the year as compared to net occupancy expense increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the higher net occupancy expense for was due mainly to increases in building depreciation of thousand  building rental expense of thousand  and real property taxes of thousand from branches added in the premier merger 
building maintenance expense increased thousand 
equipment expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of the increase from was due mainly to a thousand increase in oreo costs due to a higher level of foreclosed real estate properties during and a thousand gain on the sale of an oreo property during the second quarter of data processing expense increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of the increase was primarily due to additional outsourcing of processing functions and a change in processing procedures in addition to the premier merger 
the outsourcing of functions was partially offset by a reduction in personnel expense while the change in processing procedures is expected to result in future cost savings as united meets the requirements of check bankcard processing fees increased thousand or due to increased transactions for the year of as compared to last year 
other expenses increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of included in other expenses for are merger and related integration costs of million for the premier acquisition 
in addition  amortization of core deposit intangibles for the year of increased thousand from the same time period in due to the premier merger 
other expenses of note that increased for the year of from last year s results were business franchise taxes of thousand  loan collection expense of thousand  atm processing costs of thousand  postage costs of thousand  and stationary and supplies expense of thousand 
marketing and related costs of united s high performance checking program declined thousand in the year of as compared to the year of as discussed in note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this document  united adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
under this transition method  compensation cost to be recognized beginning in the first quarter of would include a compensation cost for all share 
table of contents based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods were not restated 
due to a modification on december  to accelerate unvested options under united s existing stock option plans  united did not recognize any compensation cost for prior to january   united accounted for its stock option plans under the intrinsic value method 
because the exercise price at the date of the grant was equal to the market value of the stock  no compensation expense was recognized 
at the annual meeting of shareholders held on may   the united shareholders approved the stock option plan and thus  became effective upon the shareholders approval 
in the year of   options were granted under the stock option plan resulting in recognition of compensation expense of thousand for the year of which is included in salaries and employee benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income 
no options were granted in  therefore  no compensation expense was recognized for the year of a form s was filed on october  with the securities and exchange commission to register all the shares available for the stock option plan 
united s efficiency ratio was for the year of as compared to for the year of income taxes for the year ended december   income taxes were million  compared to million for for the years ended december  and  united s effective tax rates were and  respectively

quarterly results the first quarter of showed an increase in diluted earnings per share in comparison to the same respective quarter of net income for the first quarter of was million or per diluted share basis compared to million or per diluted share in for the second quarter of  net income was million or per share compared to million or per diluted share in in the third quarter of  earnings were million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in the third quarter of the results for the third quarter of included significant before tax penalties of million to prepay certain long term debt 
fourth quarter of net income was million or per diluted share as compared to million or per diluted share in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  united prepaid certain fhlb long term advances in the amount of million and terminated an interest rate swap associated with one of the advances 
the prepayment of the fhlb advances resulted in before tax penalties of approximately million 
the termination of the interest rate swap resulted in a before tax loss of approximately million 
tax equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of million or from the fourth quarter of this increase in tax equivalent net interest income was primarily attributable to a million or increase in average earning assets resulting primarily from the premier acquisition 
the average yield on earning assets for the fourth quarter of was flat from the fourth quarter of while the average cost of funds increased basis points 
the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of for the fourth quarter of for the fourth quarter of  the provision for credit losses was million  an increase of million from the fourth quarter s provision of thousand in net charge offs were million for the fourth quarter of as compared to thousand for the fourth quarter of the increase in net charge offs for the fourth quarter of was due mainly to charge offs of thousand to one mortgage customer and thousand related to the certain previously mentioned residential real estate construction credits 
noninterest income for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease of million from the fourth quarter of the decrease was mainly due to a before tax loss of approximately million during the quarter on the termination 
table of contents of an interest rate swap associated with the prepayment of a fhlb advance 
excluding the amounts associated with the interest rate swap termination and security transactions  noninterest income for the fourth quarter of would have increased million or from the fourth quarter of this increase primarily resulted from an increase in fees from deposit services of million or due mainly to the high performance checking program and the premier acquisition 
in addition  revenue from trust and brokerage services grew million or for the fourth quarter of due to increased volume 
noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  an increase of million from the fourth quarter of included in the results for the fourth quarter of were before tax penalties of approximately million to prepay fhlb advances 
excluding the prepayment penalties on fhlb advances  noninterest expense would have increased million or as salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  net occupancy expense increased thousand and core deposits amortization increased thousand due mainly to the premier merger 
data processing expense increased thousand due to the outsourcing of functions  a change in processing procedures as well as the premier merger 
several other general operating expenses increased due primarily to the premier merger  none of which were individually significant 
additional quarterly financial data for and may be found in note u  notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation united s income statements generally reflect the effects of inflation 
since interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels are impacted by inflation  the resulting changes in the interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in net interest income 
similarly  operating expenses such as salaries  rents and maintenance include changing prices resulting from inflation 
one item that would not reflect inflationary changes is depreciation expense 
subsequent to the acquisition of depreciable assets  inflation causes price levels to rise  therefore  historically presented dollar values do not reflect this inflationary condition 
with inflation levels at relatively low levels and monetary and fiscal policies being implemented to keep the inflation rate increases within an acceptable range  management expects the impact of inflation would continue to be minimal in the near future 
the effect of regulatory policies and economic conditions united s business and earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
united s business and earnings are also affected by general and local economic conditions 
during the third quarter of  certain credit markets experienced difficult conditions and volatility 
downturns in the credit market can cause a decline in the value of certain loans and securities  a reduction in liquidity and a tightening of credit 
a downturn in the credit market often signals a weakening economy that can cause job losses and thus distress on borrowers and their ability to repay loans 
uncertainties in credit markets and the economy present significant challenges for the financial services industry 
regulatory policies and economic conditions have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  united cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies or economic conditions may have on its future business and earnings 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements united has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the table below presents  by payment date  significant known contractual obligations to third parties as of december  total payments due by period one year one to three to over five in thousands total or less three years five years years deposits without a stated maturity time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings operating leases excludes interest 
includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon interest rates in effect at december  the interest to be paid on variable rate obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates  which materially affect the contractual obligation amounts to be paid 
excludes carrying value adjustments such as unamortized premiums or discounts 
on january   united adopted the provisions of fin as of december   united recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  of million in accordance with fin this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that united has taken in its tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  this estimated liability is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
united also enters into derivative contracts  mainly to protect against adverse interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities  under which it is required to either pay cash to or receive cash from counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value and not notional value on the consolidated balance sheet 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the preceding table 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note p  notes to consolidated financial statements 
united is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
united s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for the loan commitments and standby letters of credit is the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
united uses the same policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 

table of contents the following tables detail the amounts of significant commitments and letters of credit as of december  in thousands amount commitments to extend credit revolving open end secured by residential credit card and personal revolving lines commercial total unused commitments financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total letters of credit commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses  generally within one year  and may require the payment of a fee 
further discussion of commitments is included in note o  notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity in the opinion of management  united maintains liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and the credit needs of its customers 
like all banks  united depends upon its ability to renew maturing deposits and other liabilities on a daily basis and to acquire new funds in a variety of markets 
a significant source of funds available to united is core deposits 
core deposits include certain demand deposits  statement and special savings and now accounts 
these deposits are relatively stable and they are the lowest cost source of funds available to united 
to help attract these lower cost deposits  united introduced its high performance checking program during the first quarter of short term borrowings have also been a significant source of funds 
these include federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as well as advances from the fhlb 
repurchase agreements represent funds that are obtained as the result of a competitive bidding process 
liquid assets are cash and those items readily convertible to cash 
all banks must maintain sufficient balances of cash and near cash items to meet the day to day demands of customers and united s cash needs 
other than cash and due from banks  the available for sale securities portfolio and maturing loans are the primary sources of liquidity 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the ability to access funding that enables united to efficiently satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and meet united s cash needs 
liquidity is managed by monitoring funds availability from a number of primary sources 
substantial funding is available from cash and cash equivalents  unused short term borrowings  and a geographically dispersed network of branches providing access to a diversified and substantial retail deposit market 
short term needs can be met through a wide array of outside sources such as correspondent and downstream correspondent federal funds and utilization of federal home loan bank advances 
other sources of liquidity available to united to provide long term as well as short term funding alternatives  in addition to fhlb advances  are long term certificates of deposit  lines of credit  borrowings that are secured by bank premises or stock of united s subsidiaries and issuances of trust preferred securities 
in the normal course of business  united through its asset liability committee evaluates these as well as other alternative funding strategies that may be utilized to meet short term and long term funding needs

table of contents cash flows provided by operations in were million which was comparable to the million of cash provided by operations during in  net cash of million was used in investing activities as compared to net cash of million being provided by investing activities in in  net cash used for purchases of investment securities exceeded net proceeds from sales  calls and maturities of investment securities by million while net cash of million was paid for the acquisition of premier and net cash of million was used for loan growth 
in  investing activities provided cash of million mainly as a result of net cash received of million for excess net proceeds from sales  calls and maturities of investment securities over purchases which was partially offset by loan growth of million 
for the year of  net cash of million was provided by financing activities due primarily to an increase in borrowings of million which more than offset a decline in deposits of million 
cash used for financing activities in included payment of million and million  respectively  for cash dividends and acquisitions of united shares under the stock repurchase program 
for the year of  net cash of million was used in financing activities due primarily to the net repayment of long term fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
additional cash used in financing activities in included million for payment of cash dividends and million for acquisitions of united shares under the stock repurchase program 
cash provided by financing activities included growth in deposits of million and an increase in federal funds purchased of million 
the net effect of the cash flow activities was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year of as compared to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year of see the consolidated statement of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements 
united anticipates it can meet its obligations over the next months and has no material commitments for capital expenditures 
there are no known trends  demands  commitments  or events that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in united s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
united also has lines of credit available 
see notes j and k  notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding the amounts available to united under line of credit 
the asset liability committee monitors liquidity to ascertain that a liquidity position within certain prescribed parameters is maintained 
no changes are anticipated in the policies of united s asset and liability committee 
capital resources united s capital position is financially sound 
united seeks to maintain a proper relationship between capital and total assets to support growth and sustain earnings 
united has historically generated attractive returns on shareholders equity 
based on regulatory requirements  united and its banking subsidiaries are categorized as well capitalized institutions 
united s risk based capital ratios of at december  and at december   were both significantly higher than the minimum regulatory requirements 
united s tier i capital and leverage ratios of and  respectively  at december   are also well above minimum regulatory requirements 
being classified as a well capitalized institution allows united to have special regulatory consideration in various areas 
see note s  notes to consolidated financial statements 
total year end shareholders equity increased million or to million from million at december  united s equity to assets ratio was at december  as compared to at december  the primary capital ratio  capital and reserves to total assets and reserves  was at december   as compared to at december  united s average equity to average asset ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all these financial measurements reflect a financially sound position 
during the fourth quarter of  united s board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share 
dividends per share of for the year of represented a increase over the per share paid for total cash dividends declared to common shareholders were approximately million for the year of as compared to million for the year of  an increase of 
the year was the thirty fourth consecutive year of dividend increases to united shareholders 
during the second quarter of  united s board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan repurchase plan to repurchase up to million shares of united s common stock on the open market effective upon completion of the 
table of contents repurchase plan 
the timing  price and quantity of purchases under the repurchase plan will be at the discretion of management  and the plan may be discontinued  suspended  or restarted at any time depending on the facts and circumstances 
the repurchase plan  depending on market conditions provides capital management opportunities 
shares purchased under the plan will be available to fund employee benefit programs as well as for a variety of other corporate purposes 
for the year of  united repurchased  shares under this repurchase plan approved by its board of directors in the following table shows selected consolidated operating and capital ratios for each of the last three years ended december return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio compared to financial condition summary united s total assets as of december  were billion  a decrease of million or less than from year end the slight decrease in total assets was primarily due to a million or decrease investment securities 
securities available for sale decreased million or while securities held to maturity declined million  which was a decrease of 
partially offsetting the decrease in investment securities were increases in portfolio loans of million or  cash and cash equivalents of million or and other assets of million or 
the increase in portfolio loans for was primarily attributable to increased production in construction loans  commercial real estate loans and commercial loans not secured by real estate of million or  million or and million or  respectively 
consumer loans declined million or 
in addition  cash and cash equivalents increased million or 
of this total increase  cash and due from banks increased million  interest bearing deposits with other banks increased million and federal funds sold increased million 
during the year of  net cash of million and million was provided by operating activities and investing activities  respectively 
net cash of million was used in financing activities 
other assets increased million or from year end due mainly to a million increase in the net pension asset as a result of a million contribution during the third quarter of  which was substantially reduced by an adjustment of million to initially adopt financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans to properly reflect the funded status of united s pension plan 
in addition  the value of cash surrender life insurance policies increased million 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline in deferred tax assets of million  a decline of million in derivative assets and a drop of million in deposit intangibles 
the decrease in total assets is reflected in a corresponding decrease in total liabilities of million 
the decrease in total liabilities was due mainly to a reduction of million or and million or in overnight federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and long term fhlb advances  respectively 
in addition  securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased million or during the year of partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million or in federal funds purchased and an increase in deposits of million or from year end in terms of composition  noninterest bearing deposits decreased million while interest bearing deposits increased million from december  borrowings decreased million or during the year of shareholders equity decreased million or less than from year end as united continued to balance capital adequacy and returns to shareholders 
the slight decrease in shareholders equity was due mainly to a rise in treasury stock of 
table of contents million due to repurchases of united shares by the company  a decline in surplus of million due to the exercise of stock options and a million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income due primarily to a million  net of deferred income taxes  adjustment to adopt sfas and a decrease of million  net of deferred income taxes  in the fair value adjustments on cash flow hedges 
partially offsetting these decreases were earnings  net of dividends declared  of million for the year of and an increase within accumulated other comprehensive income of million  net of deferred income taxes  in the fair value of united s available for sale investment portfolio 
earnings summary net income for the year was million or per diluted share compared to million or per share for the year of the results for the year of included significant before tax charges totaling million to prepay certain long term debt 
during the third quarter of  united prepaid certain federal home loan bank fhlb long term advances in the amount of million and terminated an interest rate swap associated with one of the advances 
the prepayment of the fhlb advances resulted in before tax penalties of approximately million 
the termination of the interest rate swap resulted in a before tax loss of approximately million 
united s management believed that the prepayment of these borrowings and the termination of the interest rate swap will improve united s future net interest margin and enhance future earnings 
united s return on average assets for the year of was and return on average shareholders equity was as compared to and  respectively  for the year of tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or less than from the year of the provision for credit losses was million for the year as compared to million for the year of noninterest income was million for the year of  down million or when compared to the year of included in total noninterest income for the year of was a net before tax loss of million on the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances in the first and third quarters of as previously mentioned  during the third quarter of  united incurred a before tax loss of approximately million to terminate an interest rate swap associated with the prepayment of a fhlb advance 
during the first quarter of  as part of a balance sheet repositioning strategy  united terminated an interest rate swap associated with the repayment of a fhlb advance that was being hedged 
united recognized a million before tax gain on the termination of that swap 
in addition  united s income from investment security transactions declined million for the year of as compared to the year of as united incurred a net loss on security transactions of million in the first quarter of due to an other than temporary impairment on approximately million of low yielding fixed rate investment securities that united subsequently sold as part of the balance sheet repositioning 
excluding the results of investment security transactions and interest rate swap terminations  noninterest income for the year of would have increased million or from the year of noninterest expense increased million or for the year of when compared to the increase was due mainly to an increase of million in before tax penalties to prepay fhlb advances 
excluding the prepayment penalties  noninterest expense for the year of would have increased million or from the year of united s effective tax rate was approximately and for years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to for the following discussion explains in more detail the results of operations by major category 
net interest income net interest income represents the primary component of united s earnings 
it is the difference between interest income from earning assets and interest expense incurred to fund these assets 
net interest income is impacted by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in market interest rates 
such changes  and their impact on net interest income in  are summarized below 

table of contents tax equivalent net interest income for the year of was million  an increase of million or less than from the year of the net interest margin for the year of was  down basis points from a net interest margin of during the same period in tax equivalent interest income for the year of was million  a million or increase from the year of as the average yield on earning assets for year of increased basis points from the year of due to higher interest rates 
in addition  average earning assets increased million or due to average loan growth of million or 
partially offsetting the loan growth was an million or decline in average investments 
for the year of  interest income from united s asset securitization increased thousand from the same period in interest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of the increase in interest expense for the year of was mainly due to a basis point rise in the average cost of funds from the year of as a result of the higher interest rates 
the average cost of deposits was for the year of  up basis points from for the year of while the average cost of short term borrowing was for the year of  an increase of basis points from for the year of a sustained flat yield curve between short term and long term interest rates resulted in a lesser increase in yields on earning assets while the upward trend in the general market interest rates resulted in a more significant increase to funding costs 
provision for credit losses for the years ended december  and  the provision for credit losses was million and million  respectively 
net charge offs were million for the year of as compared to net charge offs of million for the year of at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  compared to million at december  as a percentage of loans  net of unearned income  the allowance for credit losses was and at december  and  respectively 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was and at december  and  respectively 
other income noninterest income was million for the year of  down million or from the year of included in total noninterest income for the year of was a million net before tax loss on the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances in the first and third quarters of additionally  united incurred a net loss on securities transactions of million during the year of due mainly to an other than temporary impairment charge of million in the first quarter of on approximately million of low yielding fixed rate investment securities which united subsequently sold as part of a balance sheet repositioning 
united realized net gains of thousand on securities transactions during excluding the results of investment security transactions and interest rate swap terminations  noninterest income for the year of would have increased million or from the year of trust income and brokerage commissions increased million or due to a greater volume of business and a larger customer base 
service charges  commissions and fees from customer accounts increased million or for the year of as compared to the year the largest component within this category is fees from deposit services which increased million or due mainly to united s high performance checking program introduced during the first quarter of mortgage banking income decreased thousand or due to fewer mortgage loan sales in the secondary market during the year of as compared to income from bank owned life insurance policies decreased thousand or while other income increased million or for the year of as compared to last year s income during the same period in other income increased as united received additional residual income of thousand from prior third party asset securitizations and income of thousand from the outsourcing of its official checks processing which 
table of contents united initiated in other expense noninterest expense for the year of was million  an increase of million or from the year of this increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to the before tax penalties of approximately million to prepay million of fhlb advances during the third quarter of excluding these penalties  noninterest expense would have increased million or for the year of  compared to the year of for the year of  the remaining balance of the increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to a million or increase in salaries and benefits expense as compared to the same period in salaries expense for the year increased million or as a result of the higher base salaries and performance based commissions 
health care and pension costs increased thousand or and thousand or  respectively  for the year of as compared to the year of the remainder of the increases in noninterest expense for the year of from the year of was due primarily to expenses related to united s new high performance checking hpc program 
united incurred marketing and related costs of approximately million during to launch and promote its high performance checking hpc program for consumer customers 
however  the increased spending is having the desired impact of attracting low cost deposits 
largely due to the high performance checking hpc initiative  united opened  new consumer accounts during as compared to  new consumer accounts in net occupancy expense increased thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of the higher net occupancy expense for was due mainly to increases in building rent expense and real property taxes 
equipment expense declined thousand or for the year of as compared to the year of the decrease during was due mainly to a thousand gain on the sale of an oreo property during the second quarter of and lower levels of depreciation and maintenance expense 
data processing expense increased thousand or for year of as compared to the year of the increase was primarily due to additional outsourcing of data processing functions 
bankcard processing fees increased thousand or due to increased transactions for the year of as compared to the year of other expenses increased million or for the year of as compared to the year of due primarily to the expenses previously mentioned related to united s new hpc program 
in addition  legal and consulting fees  excluding those related to the hpc program  increased thousand from the same period in atm processing fees were up thousand or for the year of as compared to due to increased transactions 
the remaining increase in all other expenses in the year of from was due mainly to increases in several general operating expenses  none of which were individually significant 
united s efficiency ratio was for the year of as compared to for the year of income taxes for the year ended december   consolidated income taxes were million  compared to million for for the years ended december  and  united s effective tax rates were and  respectively 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of united s asset liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within united s policy guidelines 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposures due to changes in economic conditions  interest rate levels and customer preferences 
interest rate risk management considers interest rate risk to be united s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in united s net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
united s earnings are largely dependent on the effective management of interest rate risk 
management of interest rate risk focuses on maintaining consistent growth in net interest income within board approved policy limits 
united s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk to maintain an acceptable level of change to net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
policy established for interest rate risk is stated in terms of the change in net interest income over a one year and two year horizon given an immediate and sustained increase or decrease in interest rates 
the current limits approved by the board of directors are structured on a staged basis with each stage requiring specific actions 
united employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its exposure to changing interest rates 
one such technique utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the model also includes executive management projections for activity levels in product lines offered by united 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
rate scenarios could involve parallel or nonparallel shifts in the yield curve  depending on historical  current  and expected conditions  as well as the need to capture any material effects of explicit or embedded options 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management s strategies 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or are repriced within a designated time frame 
the principal function of managing interest rate risk is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified periods of time is known as the gap 
earnings simulation analysis captures not only the potential of these interest sensitive assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
moreover  earnings simulation analysis considers the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet items and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
united closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an on going basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin 
the following table shows united s estimated consolidated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  and change in interest rates percentage change in net interest income basis points december  december  given an immediate  sustained basis point upward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  it is estimated that net interest income for united would increase by over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of as of december  a basis point immediate  sustained upward shock in the yield curve would increase net interest income by an estimated over one year as of december   as compared to an increase of 
table of contents as of december  a and basis point immediate  sustained downward shock in the yield curve would decrease net interest income by an estimated and  respectively  over one year as of december  as compared to a decrease of and respectively  over one year as of december  this analysis does not include the potential increased refinancing activities  which should lessen the negative impact on net income from falling rates 
while it is unlikely market rates would immediately move or basis points upward or downward on a sustained basis  this is another tool used by management and the board of directors to gauge interest rate risk 
all of these estimated changes in net interest income are and were within the policy guidelines established by the board of directors 
to further aid in interest rate management  united s subsidiary banks are members of the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the use of fhlb advances provides united with a low risk means of matching maturities of earning assets and interest bearing funds to achieve a desired interest rate spread over the life of the earning assets 
in addition  united uses credit with large regional banks and trust preferred securities to provide funding 
as part of its interest rate risk management strategy  united may use derivative instruments to protect against adverse price or interest rate movements on the value of certain assets or liabilities and on future cash flows 
these derivatives commonly consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars  futures  forward contracts  written and purchased options 
interest rate swaps obligate two parties to exchange one or more payments generally calculated with reference to a fixed or variable rate of interest applied to the notional amount 
united accounts for its derivative activities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
extension risk a key feature of most mortgage loans is the ability of the borrower to repay principal earlier than scheduled 
this is called a prepayment 
prepayments arise primarily due to sale of the underlying property  refinancing  or foreclosure 
in general  declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments  and rising interest rates tend to slow prepayments 
like other fixed income securities  when interest rates rise  the value of mortgage related securities generally declines 
the rate of prepayments on underlying mortgages will affect the price and volatility of mortgage related securities and may shorten or extend the effective maturity of the security beyond what was anticipated at the time of purchase 
if interest rates rise  united s holdings of mortgage related securities may experience reduced returns if the borrowers of the underlying mortgages pay off their mortgages later than anticipated 
this is generally referred to as extension risk 
at december   united s mortgage related securities portfolio had an amortized cost of million  of which approximately million or were fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these fixed rate cmos consisted primarily of planned amortization class pacs and accretion directed vadms bonds having an average life of approximately years and a weighted average yield of  under current projected prepayment assumptions 
these securities are expected to have very little extension risk in a rising rate environment 
current models show that given an immediate  sustained upward shock of basis points  the average life of these securities would extend to years 
the projected price decline of the fixed rate cmo portfolio in rates up basis points would be  less than the price decline of a year treasury note 
by comparison  the price decline of a year current coupon mortgage backed security mbs in rates higher by basis points would be approximately 
united had approximately million in year mortgage backed securities with a projected yield of and a projected average life of years on december  these bonds are projected to be good risk reward securities in stable rates  rates down moderately and rates up moderately due to the high yield and premium book price 
however  should rates increase basis points  the average life will extend and these bonds will experience significant price depreciation  but not as significant as current coupon pools 
the remaining of the mortgage related securities portfolio at december   included adjustable rate securities arms  balloon securities  and year and year mortgage backed pass through securities
