this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed human interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing  communications  entertainment  and other electronic devices 
we believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our net revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
in fiscal  we derived of our net revenue from the personal computer market 
in fiscal  revenue from the personal computer market accounted for of our net revenue 
many of our customers have migrated their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and many of our oem customers have established design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  including offices in china  hong kong  japan  korea  switzerland  taiwan  and the united states  we are well positioned to provide local sales  operational  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  on a global basis 
our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and primarily drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers facilities  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our contract manufacturers with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
however  we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers 
currently  we use two third party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and two third party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary asics 
in certain cases  we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  logistics  manufacturing  assembly  and test costs paid to third party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel 

table of contents additionally  all warranty costs  yield losses  and any inventory provisions or write downs are charged to cost of revenue 
our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost improvement programs 
these cost improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products  which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost improvement programs 
as a result  new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin 
our research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development  as well as the engineering costs incurred to design human interface solutions for customers prior to and after the customers commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market and usability research  outside legal  accounting  and consulting costs  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  primarily reflecting incremental staffing and related support costs associated with our increased business levels  anticipated growth in our existing markets  and penetration into new markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  cost of revenue  inventories  product warranty  provision for income taxes  income taxes payable  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  applicable laws  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates  interpretations  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity s financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain when estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances  based on historical experience  at the time we recognize revenue 
we record contract revenue for research and development as the services are provided under the terms of the contract 
we recognize non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist and for which there is no continuing involvement by us on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
sudden declines in demand  rapid 
table of contents product improvements  or technological changes  or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the following factors influence our estimates changes to or cancellations of customer orders  unexpected decline in demand  rapid product improvements and technological advances  and termination or changes by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
periodically  we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer s delivery schedule is delayed or a customer s order is cancelled 
in those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers  we consider a write down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value 
we charge write downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete  slow moving  and non usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue 
share based compensation costs we account for employee share based compensation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  and apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee share based compensatory awards  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical and implied volatilities were used in estimating the fair value of our share based awards  while the expected life for our options was estimated to be five years based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
further  as required under sfas r  we estimate forfeitures for share based awards that are not expected to vest 
we charge the estimated fair value less estimated forfeitures to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years for our stock option and deferred stock units and up to two years for our employee stock purchase plan 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock option and employee stock purchase plan awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option pricing model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new  and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and guidance 
there are significant variations among allowable valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future  resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods 
our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models  inputs  or assumptions  and the resulting differences in comparability could be material 
income taxes we recognize federal  foreign  and state current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the then current fiscal year for each tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  foreign  and state deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and our judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be changed  which could impact income tax expense 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal fin contains a two 
table of contents step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with fin the first step is to determine when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties 
however  our results have in the past  and could in the future  include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved  upon the filing of an amended return  upon a change in facts  circumstances  or interpretation  or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation 
accordingly  our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognize tax benefit upon expensing nonqualified stock options and deferred stock units issued under our share based compensation plans 
however  under current accounting standards  we cannot recognize tax benefit concurrent with expensing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options issued under our share based compensation plans 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of sfas r  we recognize tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  which historically has been up to several years after vesting and in a period when our stock price substantially increases 
for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of sfas r  the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid in capital 
accordingly  because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and such disqualified dispositions may happen in periods when our stock price substantially increases  and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to estimate reasonably our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is greatly diminished

the increase in net revenue for the year ended june  was attributable to a million  or  increase in pc applications net revenue and a million  or  increase in digital lifestyle product applications net revenue 
the increase in pc applications net revenue was primarily attributable to notebook industry growth  continuing adoption by notebook oems of our capacitive interface multimedia controls  and additional penetration in pc peripherals  partially offset by a decline in pc applications market share 
digital lifestyle product application net revenue growth resulted from both industry growth and higher market penetration 
based on industry estimates  notebook market growth for is anticipated to be approximately  digital music player market growth for is anticipated to be approximately  and mobile smartphone and feature phone market growth for is anticipated to be approximately 
the overall increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to a increase in unit shipments  reflecting industry growth and higher market penetration in the digital lifestyle product application markets  partially offset by a lower priced product mix  which included both our custom modules and onetouch asic shipments  and general competitive pricing pressure  and a decline in pc applications market share and the combination of which resulted in an overall reduction in the unit price of our product mix when compared to the prior year

the note plus accrued interest of million came due in august  and  in accordance with the security agreement  we surrendered the  series a preferred shares securing the note to national in full settlement of the principal and accrued interest 
consequently  we recognized a non operating gain upon settlement of debt in the amount of million in fiscal impairment of investment 
in fiscal  we participated in an equity financing  receiving million series e preferred shares of foveon for a cash investment of million 
we are not obligated to provide additional funding to foveon 
we accounted for our series e preferred shares of foveon under the cost method in accordance with apb opinion no

because the investment is not in substance common stock 
in fiscal  we determined there was an other than temporary impairment of the carrying value of our investment in foveon  due to liquidity visibility and liquidation preferences for the most recent preferred equity round  in which we did not participate 
consequently  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge

common stock purchase program 
in july  our board of directors authorized an additional million for our common stock purchase program 
the program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions and other factors 
the number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock 
from april through june   we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of million or an average cost of per share under our authorized common stock purchase programs 
as of july  we had million remaining under our common stock purchase program  which expires in july bank credit facility 
we currently maintain a million working capital line of credit with wells fargo bank

table of contents convertible senior subordinated notes 
in december  we issued an aggregate of million of convertible senior subordinated notes maturing december  the notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
in connection with issuing the notes  we incurred debt issuance costs of million  consisting primarily of the initial purchasers discount and costs related to legal  accounting  and printing  which are being amortized over five years 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable on december and june of each year 
however  we will pay additional contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes is at or above of the principal amount of the notes for a specified period beginning with the six month period commencing december  the amount of contingent interest payable on the notes with respect to a six month period  for which contingent interest applies  will equal per annum of the average trading price of the notes for a specified five trading day period preceding such six month period 
as a result of our irrevocable election in april to cash settle the principal amount of the notes  no shares of common stock will be issued to settle the principal amount of the notes and cash or common stock may be used to settle the value of the notes in excess of million 
our election to cash settle the principal amount of the notes upon conversion resulted in our using the if converted method through the date of the election and the treasury stock method subsequent to the date of the election for purposes of calculating diluted net income per share 
accordingly  we will include on a prospective basis diluted shares underlying the notes in our diluted net income per share calculation only when the average closing stock price for the accounting period exceeds the conversion price of the notes  which is per share 
the notes may be converted if  during any calendar quarter commencing after december   the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on such last trading day  on or after january   if we have called the notes for redemption  or during prescribed periods  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions or fundamental changes 
on or after december   we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional interest  if any 
noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on december   december   and december  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional interest  if any 
as of june   none of the conditions for conversion of the notes had occurred 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future indebtedness or other obligations that are not  by their terms  either senior or subordinated to the notes  including trade debt and other general unsecured obligations that do not constitute senior or subordinated indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to all of our future indebtedness that  by its terms  is subordinated to the notes 
there are no financial covenants in the notes 
million shelf registration 
we have registered an aggregate of million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions  which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under rule of the securities act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company  in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements over the course of at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth or decline  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  costs related to protecting our intellectual property  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions  our common stock purchase program  and the amount and timing of our investments in  or acquisitions of  other technologies or companies 
further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained 

table of contents our non current investments include million original cost basis of ars that have failed to settle in auctions 
these failures generally resulted in the interest rates resetting from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points on the regularly scheduled auction dates 
these investments are not liquid and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless a future auction on these investments is successful 
in  we have reduced the carrying value of these investments by million  of which million was accounted for as other than temporary impairment with a corresponding charge to income  and million was accounted for as temporary impairment through other comprehensive income or loss 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in millions payments due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years convertible senior subordinated notes building leases total represents both principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation 
our convertible senior subordinated notes include a provision allowing the noteholders to require us  at the noteholders discretion  to repurchase their notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional interest  if any on december   december   and december  and in the event of a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the notes 
the early repayment of the notes is not reflected in the above schedule  but if all the noteholders elected to exercise their rights to require us to repurchase their notes on december   then our contractual obligations for the one to three year period would be increased by million and no amounts would be due in more than three years 
as of june   we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support  engage in leasing  hedging  or research and development services  or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in the financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our current investment portfolio consists primarily of government backed securities and investment grade instruments and we would not expect the fair value of our investments to be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates  however  our interest income will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash equivalents  investments and debt obligations as of june  in thousands  except for average interest rates fair fiscal year ended june  thereafter total value assets cash equivalents variable rate money market average interest rate cash equivalents fixed rate commercial paper average interest rate us treasury average interest rate total cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments fixed rate commercial paper average interest rate municipal securities average interest rate total short term investments average interest rate non current investments average interest rate liabilities convertible senior subordinated notes fixed rate amounts average interest rate our convertible senior subordinated notes bear a fixed coupon interest rate of and mature in december accordingly  we are not exposed to changes in interest rates related to our long term debt instruments 
the notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system 
the fair value of the notes may increase or decrease for various reasons  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  fluctuations in market interest rates  and fluctuations in general economic conditions 
the principal and carrying amount of the notes at june  was million and the fair value of the notes was approximately million based on trading prices 
our notes include a provision allowing the noteholders to require us  at the noteholders discretion  to repurchase their notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional interest  if any on december   december   and december  and in the event of a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the notes 
the early repayment of the notes is not reflected in the preceding schedule  but if all the noteholders elected to exercise 
table of contents their rights to require us to repurchase their notes on december   then maturities in the column would increase by million and maturities in the thereafter column would decrease by a corresponding amount 
our non current investments include million original cost basis of ars which have failed to settle in auctions 
these failures generally resulted in the interest rates resetting from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points on the regularly scheduled auction dates 
these investments are not liquid and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal  unless a future auction on these investments is successful 
as there are currently no active markets for our various failed ars investments  we have estimated the fair value of these investments as of june  based on a trinomial discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis considered  among other factors  the collateral underlying the security investments  creditworthiness of the counterparty  timing of expected future cash flows  and the probability of a successful auction in a future period 
when possible  our failed ars investments were compared to other observable market data or securities with similar characteristics 
in fiscal  we reduced the carrying value of these investments by million  of which million was accounted for as other than temporary impairment with a corresponding charge to income and million was accounted for as temporary impairment through other comprehensive income or loss 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio and debt obligations subsequent to june  foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenue and approximately of our consolidated costs are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been immaterial to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if our operations change and we determine that our foreign exchange exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to mitigate such risk
