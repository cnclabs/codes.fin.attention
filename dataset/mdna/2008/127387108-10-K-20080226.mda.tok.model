item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the license term  whereas product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the product  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog varies from quarter to quarter 
for the past three years the amount of product revenue recognized from backlog generally has been approximately two thirds of total product revenue 
our revenue and results of operations may miss expectations due to a shortfall in product revenue generated from current transactions or variance in the actual mix of license types executed in any given period  and due to other contract specific terms and conditions as discussed above 
we are subject to greater credit risk on subscription and term licenses  as compared to perpetual licenses  due to the installment payment terms generally associated with those license types 
otherwise  the particular risks of one license type versus another type do not vary considerably 
from time to time we sell receivables generated by our licenses with installment payment terms to third party financing institutions on a non recourse or limited recourse basis 
for a further description of our license agreements  revenue recognition policies and results of operations  please refer to the discussion under the heading critical accounting estimates under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development our investment in research and development was million in  million in and million in the primary areas of our research and development include soc design  the design of silicon devices in the nanometer range  high performance ic packaging  sip and pcb design  system level modeling and verification  high performance logic verification technology and hardware software co verification 
because the electronics industry combines rapid innovation with rapidly increasing design and manufacturing complexity  we make significant investments in enhancing our current products  as well as creating new products and technologies and integrating those products and technologies together into segmented solutions 
our future performance depends largely on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product development and commercialization  to develop  acquire or operate with new products from third parties  and to develop solutions that meet increasingly demanding productivity  quality  predictability and cost requirements 
in addition to our product development team  which focuses on new and existing products  we maintain cadence laboratories  an advanced research group responsible for exploring new technologies  moving those technologies into product development and maintaining strong industry relationships 
manufacturing and distribution our software production consists of configuring the customer s order  recording the product electronically or on cd rom  and producing unique access keys that allow customers to use licensed products 
software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery 
user manuals and other 
table of contents documentation are generally available by secure electronic delivery or on cd rom  but are occasionally supplied in hard copy format 
cadence performs final assembly and test of its hardware verification  acceleration and emulation products in san jose  california 
subcontractors manufacture all major subassemblies  including all individual pcbs and custom ics  and supply them for qualification and testing prior to their incorporation into the assembled product 
proprietary technology our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
we may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for this third party software and other intellectual property in the future 
as part of performing design and methodology services for customers  our design and methodology services business uses certain software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties  including that of our competitors 
competition we compete in the eda market for products and maintenance primarily with three companies synopsys  inc  mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation  inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies  with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products  and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies 
we generally compete on the basis of product quality  product features  level of integration or compatibility with other tools  price  payment terms and maintenance offerings 
our maintenance business flows directly from our product business 
the competitive issues associated with our maintenance business are substantially similar to those for our product business in that every maintenance contract is the direct result of a product contract  and once we have entered into a product contract  maintenance is generally purchased by the customer to ensure access to bug fixes and service releases  as and when they are made available  and other continued support 
certain competitive factors in the design and methodology services business as described herein differ from those of the products and maintenance businesses 
while we do compete with other eda companies in the design and methodology services business  our principal competitors are independent design and methodology service businesses 
these companies vary greatly in focus  geographic location  capability  cost structure and pricing 
in addition  manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase services from independent vendors  such as cadence  because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 
we compete with these companies by focusing on the design of complex analog and digital ics 
it is our strategy to use design and methodology services as a differentiator to further promote our products and maintenance businesses 
backlog our backlog on december  was approximately billion  as compared to approximately billion on december  backlog consists of revenue to be recognized in future fiscal periods after december  from a variety of license types which generally include  but are not limited to subscription licenses for software products  sale or lease of hardware  maintenance contracts on hardware and software products  orders for hardware and software products sold on perpetual and term licenses on which customers have delivery dates after december   licenses with payments that are outside our customary terms  and the undelivered portion of design and methodology services contracts 
the substantial majority of our backlog is generated by our product and maintenance businesses because customer licenses generally include both product and maintenance components 
historically  we have not experienced significant cancellations of our contracts with customers 
however  we occasionally reschedule the required completion dates of design and methodology services contracts which  at times  defers revenue recognition 
table of contents under those contracts beyond the original expected completion date 
changes in customer license types or payment terms also can impact the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue seasonality historically  orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter  with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year 
we expect the first quarter will remain our lowest quarter for orders and revenues 
international operations we have approximately sales offices  design centers and research and development facilities located around the world 
we consider customer sales and support requirements  the availability of a skilled workforce  and costs and efficiencies  among other relative benefits  when determining what operations to locate internationally 
for additional information regarding our international operations  see the discussion under the heading the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition in item a  risk factors and note to our consolidated financial statements 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals  with approximately  in sales  services  marketing  support and manufacturing activities  approximately  in product research and development and approximately in management  administration and finance 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union  and we have experienced no work stoppages 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
described below are what we believe to be the material risks that we face 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
risks related to our business we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries  and any downturn in these industries may reduce our revenue 
purchases of our products and services are dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by ic manufacturers and electronics systems companies 
the ic and electronics systems industries are cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the ic and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both these industries and their customers products and a decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any economic downturn in the industries we serve could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
our failure to respond quickly to technological developments could make our products uncompetitive and obsolete 
the industries in which we compete experience rapid technology developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
currently  the industries we serve are experiencing several revolutionary trends migration to nanometer design the size of features such as wires  transistors and contacts on ics continuously shrink due to the ongoing advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
process feature sizes refer to the width of the transistors and the width and spacing of interconnect on the ic 
feature size is normally identified by the transistor length  which is shrinking rapidly to nanometers and smaller 
this is commonly referred to in the semiconductor industry as the migration to nanometer design 
it represents a major challenge for participants in the semiconductor industry  from ic design and 
table of contents design automation to design of manufacturing equipment and the manufacturing process itself 
shrinkage of transistor length to such proportions is challenging the industry in the application of more complex physics and chemistry that is needed to realize advanced silicon devices 
for eda tools  models of each component s electrical properties and behavior become more complex as do requisite analysis  design and verification capabilities 
novel design tools and methodologies must be invented quickly to remain competitive in the design of electronics in the smallest nanometer ranges 
the challenges of nanometer design are leading some customers to work with older  less risky manufacturing processes 
this may reduce their need to upgrade their eda products and design flows 
the ability to design system on a chip devices  or socs  increases the complexity of managing a design that  at the lowest level  is represented by billions of shapes on the fabrication mask 
in addition  socs typically incorporate microprocessors and digital signal processors that are programmed with software  requiring simultaneous design of the ic and the related software embedded on the ic 
with the availability of seemingly endless gate capacity  there is an increase in design reuse  or the combining of off the shelf design ip with custom logic to create ics 
the unavailability of high quality design ip that can be reliably incorporated into a customer s design with cadence ic implementation products and services could reduce demand for our products and services 
increased technological capability of the field programmable gate array  which is a programmable logic chip  creates an alternative to ic implementation for some electronics companies 
this could reduce demand for cadence s ic implementation products and services 
a growing number of low cost design and methodology services businesses could reduce the need for some ic companies to invest in eda products 
if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments  we may lose our competitive position  and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete 
to compete successfully  we must develop or acquire new products and improve our existing products and processes on a schedule that keeps pace with technological developments and the requirements for products addressing a broad spectrum of designers and designer expertise in our industries 
we must also be able to support a range of changing computer software  hardware platforms and customer preferences 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort 
we have experienced varied operating results  and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products  fluctuations in customer preferences for license types and the timing of revenue recognition under those license types 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  varied operating results 
in particular  we have experienced net losses for some past periods and we may experience net losses in future periods 
various factors affect our operating results and some of them are not within our control 
our operating results for any period are affected by the timing of significant orders for our software products because a significant number of licenses for our software products are in excess of million 
our operating results are also affected by the mix of license types executed in any given period 
we license software using three different license types subscription  term and perpetual 
product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses is generally recognized at the beginning of the license period  whereas product revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized over multiple periods during the term of the license 
revenue may also be deferred under term and perpetual licenses until payments become due and payable from customers with nonlinear payment terms or as cash is collected from customers with lower credit ratings 
in addition  revenue is impacted by the timing of license renewals  the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms  changes in existing contractual arrangements with customers and the mix of license types ie  perpetual  term or subscription for existing customers  which changes could have the effect of accelerating or delaying the recognition of revenue from the timing of recognition under the original contract 
we plan operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels 
these expenses and the impact of long term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term 
a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to these short term business changes 
the majority of our contracts are executed in the final two weeks of a fiscal quarter 
this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter 
due to the volume or 
table of contents complexity of transactions that we review at the very end of the quarter  or due to operational matters regarding particular agreements  we may not finish processing or ship products under some contracts that have been signed during that fiscal quarter  which means that the associated revenue cannot be recognized in that particular period 
you should not view our historical results of operations as reliable indicators of our future performance 
if revenue  operating results or our business outlook for future periods fall short of the levels expected by public market analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license or buy additional products  renew maintenance agreements and purchase additional services 
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license  service and maintenance revenues 
in future periods  customers may not necessarily license or buy additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance 
maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer s option  and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
if our customers decide not to renew their maintenance agreements or license additional products or contract for additional services  or if they reduce the scope of the maintenance agreements  our revenue could decrease  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years  if at all 
internally developing software products  integrating acquired software products and integrating intellectual property into existing platforms is expensive  and these investments often require a long time to generate returns 
our strategy involves significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we cannot predict that we will receive significant  if any  revenue from these investments 
our failure to attract  train  motivate and retain key employees may make us less competitive in our industries and therefore harm our results of operations 
our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our employees 
the high cost of training new employees  not fully utilizing these employees  or losing trained employees to competing employers could reduce our gross margins and harm our business or operating results 
competition for highly skilled employees can be intense  particularly in geographic areas recognized as high technology centers such as the silicon valley area  where our principal offices are located  and the other locations where we maintain facilities 
to attract  retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise  we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock based incentive awards  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense 
we may also be required to pay key employees significant base salaries and cash bonuses  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  the nasdaq marketplace rules require stockholder approval for new equity compensation plans and significant amendments to existing plans  including increases in shares available for issuance under such plans  and prohibit nasdaq member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions 
these regulations could make it more difficult for us to grant equity compensation to employees in the future 
to the extent that these regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity compensation to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
we have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in the future 
while we expect to carefully analyze each potential acquisition before committing to the transaction  we may not be able to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively 
in addition  acquisitions involve a number of risks 
if any 
table of contents of the following events occurs after we acquire another business  it could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating these transactions and integrating an acquired business  the discovery  after completion of the acquisition  of liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired for which we cannot realize the anticipated value  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  the failure to retain key employees of the acquired business  difficulties related to integrating the products of an acquired business in  for example  distribution  engineering and customer support areas  unanticipated costs  customer dissatisfaction with existing license agreements with cadence which may dissuade them from licensing or buying products acquired by cadence after the effective date of the license  and the failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 
in a number of our previously completed acquisitions  we have agreed to make future payments  either in the form of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments  or earnouts  based on the performance of the acquired businesses or the employees who joined us with the acquired businesses 
the performance goals pursuant to which these future payments may be made generally relate to achievement by the acquired business or the employees who joined us with the acquired business of certain specified bookings  revenue  product proliferation  product development or employee retention goals during a specified period following completion of the applicable acquisition 
future acquisitions may involve issuances of stock as full or partial payment of the purchase price for the acquired business  grants of incentive stock or options to employees of the acquired businesses which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  expenditure of substantial cash resources or the incurrence of material amounts of debt 
the specific performance goal levels and amounts and timing of employee bonuses or contingent purchase price payments vary with each acquisition 
in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december   we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash during the next months if certain performance goals related to one or more of the criteria mentioned above are achieved in full 
the competition in our industries is substantial and we may not be able to continue to successfully compete in our industries 
the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive 
if we fail to compete successfully in these industries  it could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
to compete in these industries  we must identify and develop or acquire innovative and cost competitive eda products  integrate them into platforms and market them in a timely manner 
we must also gain industry acceptance for our design and methodology services and offer better strategic concepts  technical solutions  prices and response time  or a combination of these factors  than those of other design companies and the internal design departments of electronics manufacturers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in these industries 
factors that could affect our ability to succeed include the development by others of competitive eda products or platforms and design and methodology services  which could result in a shift of customer preferences away from our products and services and significantly decrease revenue  decisions by electronics manufacturers to perform design and methodology services internally  rather than purchase these services from outside vendors due to budget constraints or excess engineering capacity  the challenges of developing or acquiring externally developed technology solutions that are adequate and competitive in meeting the requirements of next generation design challenges  the significant number of current and potential competitors in the eda industry and the low cost of entry  intense competition to attract acquisition targets  which may make it more difficult for us to acquire companies or technologies at an acceptable price or at all  and 
table of contents the combination of or collaboration among many eda companies to deliver more comprehensive offerings than they could individually 
we compete in the eda products market with synopsys  inc  mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation  inc we also compete with numerous smaller eda companies  with manufacturers of electronic devices that have developed or have the capability to develop their own eda products  and with numerous electronics design and consulting companies 
manufacturers of electronic devices may be reluctant to purchase design and methodology services from independent vendors such as us because they wish to promote their own internal design departments 
we may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully 
the highly competitive markets in which we compete can put pressure on us to reduce the prices of our products 
if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products in an effort to recapture or gain market segment share or to sell other software or hardware products  we may then need to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms to compete successfully 
any such changes would be likely to reduce our profit margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
any substantial changes to our prices and pricing policies could cause sales and software license revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies 
some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations 
these practices could  over time  significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for our products 
if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or with lower spending  then the reduced license revenues resulting from lower prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we rely on our proprietary technology as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties  and we cannot assure you that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products 
despite precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property  third parties have tried in the past  and may try in the future  to challenge  invalidate or circumvent these safeguards 
the rights granted under our patents or attendant to our other intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantages and there is no guarantee that patents will be issued on any of our pending applications and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the united states 
many of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
we may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future 
our design and methodology services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties  including that of our competitors 
our failure to obtain  for our use  software or other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights  could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
we could lose key technology or suffer serious harm to our business because of the infringement of our intellectual property rights by third parties or because of our infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
there are numerous patents in the eda industry and new patents are being issued at a rapid rate 
it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes the patent rights of others 
as a result  from time to time  we may be compelled to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a customer s rights 
intellectual property infringement claims  regardless of merit  could consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation  or cause product shipment delays  all of which could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
in settling these claims  we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if 
table of contents available  may not have terms favorable to us 
being compelled to enter into a license agreement with unfavorable terms could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
any potential intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following pay damages including the potential for treble damages  license fees or royalties including royalties for past periods to the party claiming infringement  stop licensing products or providing services that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the owner of the infringed intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign the challenged technology  which could be time consuming and costly  or not be accomplished 
if we were compelled to take any of these actions  our business or results of operations may suffer 
if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to customer data  our information systems may be perceived as being unsecure and customers may curtail or stop their use of our products and services 
our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and breaches of our security measures could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information  litigation and potential liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage information systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
we may not be able to effectively implement our restructuring activities  and our restructuring activities may not result in the expected benefits  which would negatively impact our future results of operations 
the eda market and the commercial electronics design and methodology services industries are highly competitive and change quickly 
we have responded to increased competition and changes in the industries in which we compete  in part  by restructuring our operations and at times reducing the size of our workforce 
despite our restructuring efforts in prior years  we may not achieve all of the operating expense reductions and improvements in operating margins and cash flows anticipated from those restructuring activities in the periods contemplated 
our inability to realize these benefits may result in an inefficient business structure that could negatively impact our results of operations 
we have reduced the workforce in certain revenue generating portions of our business 
these reductions in staffing levels could require us to forego certain future opportunities due to resource limitations  which could negatively affect our long term revenues 
we may need to implement further restructuring activities or reductions in our workforce based on changes in the markets and industries in which we compete or that any future restructuring efforts will be successful 
the long sales cycle of our products and services makes the timing of our revenue difficult to predict and may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
generally  we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer 
the length of the sales cycle may cause our revenue or operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
the complexity and expense associated with our business generally require a lengthy customer education  evaluation and approval process 
consequently  we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of the timing of customers competitive evaluation processes  or customers budgetary constraints and budget cycles 

table of contents long sales cycles for acceleration and emulation hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control  including insufficient  excess or obsolete inventory  variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the majority of our contracts are executed in the final two weeks of a fiscal quarter 
this makes it difficult to determine with accuracy how much business will be executed in each fiscal quarter 
also  because of the timing of large orders and our customers buying patterns  we may not learn of bookings shortfalls  revenue shortfalls  earnings shortfalls or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a fiscal quarter 
these factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly  which can cause significant fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock 
we may not be able to sell certain installment contracts to generate cash  which may impact our operating cash flows for any particular fiscal period 
we sell certain installment contracts to certain financing institutions on a non recourse or limited recourse basis to generate cash 
our ability to complete these sales of installment contracts is affected by a number of factors  including the economic conditions in the securities markets  credit policies of the financing institutions  and credit quality of customers whose installment contracts are expected to be sold 
if we are unable to sell certain installment contracts  our operating cash flows would be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that funding will be available to us or  if available  that it will be on terms acceptable to us 
if sources of funding are not available to us on a regular basis for any reason  including the occurrence of events of default  deterioration in credit quality in the underlying pool of receivables or otherwise  it would have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other risks to our international operations may seriously harm our financial condition 
we have significant operations outside the united states 
our revenue from international operations as a percentage of total revenue was approximately in  in and in we expect that revenue from our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
we also transact business in various foreign currencies 
recent economic and political uncertainty and the volatility of foreign currencies in certain regions  most notably the japanese yen  european union euro  british pound and indian rupee have had  and may in the future have  a harmful effect on our revenue or operating results 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
for example  when a foreign currency declines in value relative to the united states dollar  it takes more of the foreign currency to purchase the same amount of united states dollars than before the change 
if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we receive fewer united states dollars than we did before the change 
if we price our products and services in united states dollars  the decrease in value of the local currency results in an increase in the price for our products and services compared to those products of our competitors that are priced in local currency 
this could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
on the other hand  when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the united states dollar  it takes more united states dollars to purchase the same amount of the foreign currency 
as we use the foreign currency to pay for payroll costs and other operating expenses in our international operations  this results in an increase in operating expenses 
exposure to foreign currency transaction risk can arise when transactions are conducted in a currency different from the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries 
a subsidiary s functional currency is generally the currency in which it primarily conducts its operations  including product pricing  expenses and borrowings 
although we attempt to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  significant exchange rate movements may hurt our results of operations as expressed in united states dollars 
our international operations may also be subject to other risks  including the adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions  limitations on repatriation of earnings  
table of contents limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  recessions in foreign economies  longer collection periods for receivables and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  and united states and other governments licensing requirements for exports  which may lengthen the sales cycle or restrict or prohibit the sale or licensing of certain products 
we have offices throughout the world  including key research and development facilities outside of the united states 
our operations are dependent upon the connectivity of our operations throughout the world 
activities that interfere with our international connectivity  such as computer hacking or the introduction of a virus into our computer systems  could significantly interfere with our business operations 
our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of changes in our effective tax rates 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the following earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we are taxed at lower rates as compared to the united states federal and state statutory tax rates  an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes  including certain stock based compensation  write offs of acquired in process technology and impairment of goodwill  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws  changes in judgment from the evaluation of new information that results in a recognition  derecognition  or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period  increases to interest expenses classified in the financial statements as income taxes  new accounting standards or interpretations of such standards  a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the united states  or results of tax examinations by the internal revenue service  or irs  and state and foreign tax authorities 
any significant change in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods 
we have received examination reports from the internal revenue service proposing deficiencies in certain of our tax returns  and the outcome of current and future tax examinations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
the irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns 
in july  the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years through and issued an rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of approximately million 
in november  the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period to be approximately million 
the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period 
the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately million 
the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income 
the irs may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations 
we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues through the appeals office of the irs  or the appeals office 
we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments 
the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved 
interest is compounded daily at rates published 
table of contents by the irs  which rates are adjusted quarterly and have been between and since the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the tax years through we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on december   which was the first day of our fiscal year 
fin no 
prescribes a new recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin no 
 only income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized in the financial statements 
an income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant judgment is required in applying the principles of fin no 
and statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations 
however  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be estimated with certainty 
in addition  we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination  we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods 
forecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty  and material differences between forecasted and actual tax rates could have a material impact on our results of operations 
forecasts of our income tax position and resultant effective tax rate are complex and subject to uncertainty because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits and losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  as well as benefits from available deferred tax assets  the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules and results of tax audits 
to forecast our global tax rate  pre tax profits and losses by jurisdiction are estimated and tax expense by jurisdiction is calculated 
if the mix of profits and losses  our ability to use tax credits  or effective tax rates by jurisdiction is different than those estimates  our actual tax rate could be materially different than forecasted  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
failure to obtain export licenses could harm our business by rendering us unable to ship products and transfer our technology outside of the united states 
we must comply with regulations of the united states and of certain other countries in shipping our software products and transferring our technology outside the united states and to foreign nationals 
although we have not had any significant difficulty complying with such regulations so far  any significant future difficulty in complying could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
errors or defects in our products and services could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
our customers use our products and services in designing and developing products that involve a high degree of technological complexity  each of which has its own specifications 
because of the complexity of the systems and products with which we work  some of our products and designs can be adequately tested only when put to full use in the marketplace 
as a result  our customers or their end users may discover errors or defects in our software or the systems we design  or the products or systems incorporating our design and intellectual property may not operate as expected 
errors or defects could result in loss of customers  loss of market segment share  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources to resolve the problem  
table of contents loss of or delay in revenue  increased service costs  and liability for damages 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims  we could be prevented from hiring needed employees  incur liability for damages and incur substantial costs in defending ourselves 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that these competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets 
these claims could prevent us from hiring employees or cause us to incur liability for damages 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these claims  regardless of their merits 
defending ourselves from these claims could also divert the attention of our management away from our operations 
our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes 
our corporate headquarters  including certain of our research and development operations and certain of our distribution facilities  is located in the silicon valley area of northern california  which is a region known to experience seismic activity 
if significant seismic activity were to occur  our operations may be interrupted  which would adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we maintain research and development and other facilities in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states  and as a result we may face a higher risk of business interruption from acts of war or terrorism than businesses located only or primarily in the united states 
we maintain international research and development and other facilities  some of which are in parts of the world that are not as politically stable as the united states 
consequently  we may face a greater risk of business interruption as a result of terrorist acts or military conflicts than businesses located domestically 
furthermore  this potential harm is exacerbated given that damage to or disruptions at our international research and development facilities could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new or improve existing products as compared to other businesses which may only have sales offices or other less critical operations abroad 
we are not insured for losses or interruptions caused by acts of war or terrorism 
risks related to our securities and indebtedness our debt obligations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition  and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness 
we have a substantial level of debt 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness as follows million related to our convertible senior notes due  or the notes  million related to our convertible senior notes due  or the notes and  together with the notes  the convertible senior notes  and million related to our zero coupon zero yield senior convertible notes due  or the notes 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to satisfy our payment obligations on our debt as described below  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations  make it difficult for us to incur additional debt or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  make us more vulnerable in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the convertible senior notes or the notes  or place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have greater access to capital resources 

table of contents if we experience a decline in revenue due to any of the factors described in this section entitled risk factors  or otherwise  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
in the case of the notes  although they mature in  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on august  for of the principal amount  august  for of the principal amount and august  for of the principal amount 
as a result  although the notes mature in  the holders may require us to repurchase the notes at an additional premium in  which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted 
if we are prohibited from paying our outstanding indebtedness  we could try to obtain the consent of the lenders under those arrangements to make such payment  or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions 
if we do not obtain the necessary consents or refinance the borrowings  we may be unable to satisfy our outstanding indebtedness 
any such failure would constitute an event of default under our indebtedness  which could  in turn  constitute a default under the terms of any other indebtedness then outstanding 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various requirements of our indebtedness  we would be in default  which would permit the holders of our indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness as well 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under sec guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us  which could potentially hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and will increase the costs of such registration to us

conversion of the notes or the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
the terms of the notes and the convertible senior notes permit the holders to convert the notes and the convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock 
the notes are convertible into our common stock initially at a conversion price of per share  which would result in an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock being issued upon conversion  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
the terms of the convertible senior notes stipulate a net share settlement  which upon conversion of the convertible senior notes requires us to pay the principal amount in cash and the conversion premium  if any  in shares of our common stock based on a daily settlement amount  calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the relevant trading day observation period 
the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest  except in limited circumstances 
the conversion of some or all of the notes or the convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
prior to conversion of the notes  if the trading price of our common stock exceeds per share over specified periods  basic net income per share will be diluted 
we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august  for of the principal amount 
the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes on august  for of the principal amount  on august  for of the principal amount  or on august  for of the principal amount  by providing to the paying agent a written repurchase notice 
the repurchase notice must be delivered during the period commencing business days prior to the relevant repurchase date and ending on the 
table of contents close of business on the business day prior to the relevant repurchase date 
we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august  for of the principal amount  except for those notes that holders have required us to repurchase on august  or on other repurchase dates  as described above 
each  of principal of the notes is initially convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the notes may convert their notes prior to maturity only if the price of our common stock reaches during certain periods of time specified in the notes  specified corporate transactions occur  the notes have been called for redemption  or the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold 
as a result  although the notes mature in  the holders may require us to repurchase their notes at an additional premium in  which makes it probable that we will be required to repurchase the notes in if they have not first been repurchased by us or are not otherwise converted 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert had been met 
each  of principal of the convertible senior notes is initially convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding december  in the case of the notes and december  in the case of the notes  in each case only if the price of our common stock reaches during certain periods of time specified in the convertible senior notes  specified corporate transactions occur  or the trading price of the convertible senior notes falls below a certain threshold 
on and after november   in the case of the notes  and november   in the case of notes  until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such convertible senior notes  holders may convert their convertible senior notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible senior notes to convert had been met 
although the conversion price of the notes is currently per share  the hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of the notes effectively increased the conversion price of the notes until various dates in to approximately per share  which would result in an aggregate issuance upon conversion prior to august  of approximately million shares of our common stock 
we entered into hedge and warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes 
however  we cannot guarantee that such hedge and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution 
in addition  the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
although the conversion price of the convertible senior notes is currently per share  we entered into hedge and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible senior notes 
however  we cannot guarantee that such hedges and warrant instruments will fully mitigate the dilution 
in addition  the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 
at the option of the noteholders and the convertible senior noteholders under certain circumstances  we may be required to repurchase the notes and the convertible senior notes  as the case may be  in cash or shares of our common stock 
under the terms of the notes and the convertible senior notes  we may be required to repurchase the notes and the convertible senior notes following a fundamental change in our corporate ownership or structure  such as a change of control in which substantially all of the consideration does not consist of publicly traded securities  prior to maturity of the notes and the convertible senior notes  as the case may be 

table of contents following a fundamental change  in certain circumstances  we may choose to pay the repurchase price of the notes in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
if we choose to pay all or any part of the repurchase price of the notes in shares of our common stock  this would result in dilution to the holders of our common stock 
the repurchase price for the convertible senior notes in the event of a fundamental change must be paid solely in cash 
these repayment obligations may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that may otherwise be beneficial to investors 
hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the notes may affect the value of our common stock 
we entered into hedge transactions with various financial institutions  at the time of issuance of the convertible senior notes and the notes  with the objective of reducing the potential dilutive effect of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the notes 
we also entered into separate warrant transactions with the same financial institutions 
in connection with our hedge and warrant transactions  these financial institutions purchased our common stock in secondary market transactions and entered into various over the counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock 
these entities or their affiliates are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time prior to conversion or maturity of the convertible senior notes and the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock  other of our securities or other instruments they may wish to use in connection with such hedging 
any of these transactions and activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and  as a result  the number of shares and the value of the common stock holders will receive upon conversion of the convertible senior notes and the notes 
in addition  subject to movement in the price of our common stock  if the hedge transactions settle in our favor  we could be exposed to credit risk related to the other party with respect to the payment we are owed from such other party 
rating agencies may provide unsolicited ratings on the convertible senior notes that could reduce the market value or liquidity of our common stock 
we have not requested a rating of the convertible senior notes from any rating agency and we do not anticipate that the convertible senior notes will be rated 
however  if one or more rating agencies independently elects to rate the convertible senior notes and assigns the convertible senior notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors  or reduces such rating in the future  the market price or liquidity of the convertible senior notes and our common stock could be harmed 
should a decline in the market price of the convertible senior notes result  as compared to the price of our common stock  this may trigger the right of the holders of the convertible senior notes to convert the convertible senior notes into cash and shares of our common stock 
anti takeover defenses in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions under delaware law could prevent an acquisition of our company or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law that apply to us could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of our company 
for example our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue  at any time and without stockholder approval  preferred stock with such terms as it may determine 
no shares of preferred stock are currently outstanding 
however  the rights of holders of any of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with a person owning or more of its voting stock  or who is affiliated with the corporation and owned or more of its voting stock at any time within three years prior to the proposed business combination  for a period of three years from the date the person became a owner  unless specified conditions are met 
all or any one of these factors could limit the price that certain investors would be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could delay  prevent or allow our board of directors to resist an acquisition of our company  even if a proposed transaction were favored by a majority of our independent stockholders

 or the patent  which discloses an electronic simulation and emulation system and is allegedly owned by bhandari and vanguard  is not infringed and is invalid and unenforceable 
the complaint further sought a declaratory judgment that lsi logic corporation  or lsi  has an ownership interest in the patent that precludes bhandari and vanguard from asserting the patent without first joining lsi 
in march  cadence  magma  altera and mentor amended the complaint to further plead non infringement on the basis of obtaining a license to the patent from its co owner  lsi

table of contents overview we develop electronic design automation  or eda  software and hardware 
we license software  sell or lease hardware technology  provide maintenance for our software and hardware and provide design  methodology and education services throughout the world to help manage and accelerate electronics product development processes 
our broad range of products and services are used by the world s leading electronics companies to design and develop complex integrated circuits  or ics  and electronics systems 
with the addition of emerging nanometer design considerations to the already burgeoning set of traditional design tasks  complex soc or ic design can no longer be accomplished using a collection of discrete design tools 
what previously consisted of sequential design activities must be merged and accomplished nearly simultaneously without time consuming data translation steps 
we combine our design technologies into platforms addressing four major design activities functional verification  digital ic design  custom ic design and system interconnect design 
the four cadence design platforms are incisive functional verification  encounter digital ic design  virtuoso custom design and allegro system interconnect design platforms 
in addition  we augment these platform product offerings with a comprehensive set of dfm products that service both the digital and custom ic design flows 
these four platforms  together with our dfm products  comprise our primary product lines 
digital implementation was the fastest growing product group in in terms of revenue  driven by the focus on complex chips  advanced nodes and low power 
design challenges at the nanometer and nanometer process nodes drove upgrades in the digital  custom and dfm product groups 
also during  the allegro system interconnect design platform had a complete technology update and the custom simulation business had a significant product update 
we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business  including revenue  certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations  and we describe these items more fully below under the heading results of operations below 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
at least quarterly  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes and valuation of stock based awards have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all software licensing transactions and to all product revenue transactions where the software is not incidental 
we also apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to all hardware lease transactions 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  exists 
we license software using three different license types subscription licenses  term licenses  and perpetual licenses 
for many of our term and subscription license arrangements  we use our proprietary internet based delivery mechanism  eda on tap  to facilitate the delivery of our software products 
to maximize the efficiency of this 
table of contents delivery mechanism  we created what we refer to as eda cards  of which there are two types 
subscription license customers may purchase what we refer to as an eda platinum card  which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and the ability to use additional unspecified software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement 
term license customers may purchase what we refer to as an eda gold card  which provides the customer access to and use of all software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement 
overall  the eda cards provide greater flexibility for our customers in how and when they deploy and use our software products 
subscription licenses our subscription license arrangements offer our customers the right to access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement  generally two to four years  with no rights to return  use unspecified additional software products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement  and remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement  as well as the right to remix into other unspecified additional software products that may become available during the term of the arrangement  so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement 
these remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement 
the right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them 
customers that purchase an eda platinum card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement  and to use other unspecified additional software products that may become commercially available during the term of the arrangement  until the fees have been depleted 
in general  revenue associated with subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 
subscription license revenue is allocated to product and maintenance revenue 
the allocation to maintenance revenue is based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered maintenance that was established in connection with the sale of our term licenses 
in the event that a subscription license arrangement is terminated by mutual agreement and a new term license arrangement is entered into either concurrently with or subsequent to the termination of the subscription license arrangement  the revenue associated with the new term license arrangement is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product  assuming all other criteria in sop have been met 
term licenses our term license arrangements offer our customers the right to access and use all software products delivered at the outset of an arrangement throughout the entire term of the arrangement  generally two to four years  with no rights to return  and remix among the software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement  so long as the cumulative value of all products in use does not exceed the total license fee determined at the outset of the arrangement 
these remix rights may be exercisable multiple times during the term of the arrangement 
the right to remix all software products delivered pursuant to the license agreement is not considered an exchange or return of software because all software products have been delivered and the customer has the continuing right to use them 
customers that purchase an eda gold card have the ability during the term of the arrangement to use software products delivered at the outset of the arrangement until the fees relating to the arrangement have been depleted 
in general  revenue associated with term licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 
perpetual licenses our perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software 
in general  revenue associated with perpetual licenses is recognized upon the later of the effective date of the license or delivery of the licensed product 

table of contents persuasive evidence of an arrangement generally  we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for subscription and term licenses and hardware leases 
if a contract signed by the customer does not exist  we have historically used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for perpetual licenses  hardware sales  maintenance renewals and small fixed price service projects  such as training classes and small methodology service engagements of approximately  or less 
for all other service engagements  we use a signed professional services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist  we consider the signed contract to be the most persuasive evidence of the arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship  together with binding purchase orders from the distributor on a transaction by transaction basis 
product delivery software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers electronically 
electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer access to the software 
occasionally  we will deliver the software on a compact disc with standard transfer terms of free on board  or fob  shipping point 
our software license agreements generally do not contain conditions for acceptance 
with respect to hardware  delivery of an entire system is deemed to occur upon its successful installation 
for certain hardware products  installation is the responsibility of the customer  as the system is fully functional at the time of shipment 
for these products  delivery is deemed to be complete when the products are shipped with freight terms of fob shipping point 
for customers who purchase eda gold or eda platinum cards  delivery occurs when the customer has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to download the software pursuant to the terms of the software license agreement 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
for our installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment  we only consider that a fee is fixed or determinable if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments  when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 
we have a history of collecting receivables under installment contracts of up to five years 
significant judgment is involved in assessing whether a fee is fixed or determinable 
we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession 
our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable for term licenses 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses  revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
collection is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
we have concluded that collection is not probable for license arrangements executed with customers in certain countries 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash payment 
our experience has been that we are able to estimate whether collection is probable 
while we do not expect that experience to change  if we were to determine that collection is not probable for any license arrangement  particularly those with installment payment terms  revenue from such license would be recognized generally upon the receipt of cash payment 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value our vsoe for certain product elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing in comparable transactions when the element is sold separately 
vsoe for maintenance is generally based upon the customer s stated annual renewal rates 
vsoe for services is generally based on the price charged when the services are sold separately 
for multiple element arrangements  vsoe must exist to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of a term or perpetual license arrangement 
if vsoe does not exist for all elements to support the allocation of the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or 
table of contents more delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue as the elements are delivered 
our experience has been that we are able to determine vsoe for maintenance and time based services  but not for product 
finance fee revenue finance fees result from discounting to present value the product revenue derived from our installment contracts in which the payment terms extend beyond one year from the effective date of the contract 
finance fees are recognized using a method that approximates the effective interest method over the relevant license term and are classified as product revenue 
finance fee revenue represented approximately of total revenue for each of the years ended december   december  and december  upon the sale of an installment contract  we recognize the remaining finance fee revenue associated with the installment contract 
services revenue services revenue consists primarily of revenue received for performing design and methodology services 
these services are not related to the functionality of the products licensed 
revenue from service contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method  as work is performed  or on the percentage of completion method 
for contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees  we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion  which is based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and fin no 
under sfas no 
 income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns prior to actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred tax assets take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from various sources  including tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to prevent a loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused 
actual operating results or other events that cause us to change our expectations of the amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially affecting our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
under fin no 
 we may only recognize an income tax position in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret the application of complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations  and practices 
if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine if a tax position is effectively settled  we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination had otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is 
table of contents reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each reporting date 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements that are based on the requirements of fin no 
we must re evaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
valuation of stock based awards we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the following expected volatility of our stock  expected term of stock options  risk free interest rate for the period  expected dividends  if any  and expected forfeitures 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes pricing model for option grants is based on implied volatility calculated using the volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock 
we use this approach to determine volatility because options for our common stock are actively traded  the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee stock options  the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee stock options  and the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior with respect to option grants having similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that we expect to be forfeited 
we calculate a separate expected forfeiture rate for both stock options and restricted stock issuances based on historical trends 
the valuation of all options and the expected forfeiture rates for options and restricted stock are calculated based on one employee pool as there is no significant difference in exercise behavior between classes of employees 
of the million of stock based compensation expense recorded during  we used the current year valuation assumptions described above for million of our stock based compensation expense for options granted during  and we used prior year valuation assumptions for million of our stock based compensation expense for options granted prior to in addition  we expensed million in related to restricted stock and million related to the performance based bonus plan described below 
judgment is also required to estimate the attainment of certain predetermined performance goals for a performance based bonus plan under which payments may be made in our common stock 
each period  we estimate the most likely outcome of such performance goals and recognize any related stock based compensation expense 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in any one period can vary based on the attainment or estimated attainment of the various performance goals 
if such performance goals are not met  no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software  selling or leasing our hardware technology  providing maintenance for our software and hardware and providing design and methodology services 
we 
table of contents principally utilize three license types subscription  term and perpetual 
the different license types provide a customer with different terms of use for our products  such as the right to access new technology  the duration of the license  and payment terms 
customer decisions regarding these aspects of license transactions determine the license type  timing of revenue recognition and potential future business activity 
for example  if a customer chooses a fixed term of use  this will result in either a subscription or term license 
a business implication of this decision is that  at the expiration of the license period  the customer must decide whether to continue using the technology and therefore renew the license agreement 
because larger customers generally use products from two or more of our five product groups  rarely will a large customer completely terminate its relationship with us at expiration of the license 
see the discussion under the heading critical accounting estimates above for an additional description of license types and timing of revenue recognition 
although we believe that pricing volatility has not generally been a material component of the change in our revenue from period to period  we believe that the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on  among other things  the competitiveness of our new technology  the length of our sales cycle  and the size  duration  terms  type and timing of our contract renewals with existing customers  additional sales to existing customers  and sales to new customers 
a substantial portion of our total revenue is recognized over multiple periods 
however  a significant portion of our product revenue is recognized upon delivery of licensed software  which generally occurs upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product 
the value and duration of contracts  and consequently product revenue recognized  is affected by the competitiveness of our products 
product revenue recognized in any period is also affected by the extent to which customers purchase subscription  term or perpetual licenses  and the extent to which contracts contain flexible payment terms 
the timing of revenue recognition is also affected by changes in the extent to which existing contracts contain flexible payment terms and by changes in contractual arrangements with existing customers eg  customers transitioning from subscription license arrangements to term license arrangements 
revenue and revenue mix we analyze our software and hardware businesses by product group  combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship 
we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into platforms  which are included in the various product groups described below 
our product groups are functional verification products in this group  which include the incisive functional verification platform  are used to verify that the high level  logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct 
digital ic design products in this group  which include the encounter digital ic design platform  are used to accurately convert the high level  logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint and then detailed design information showing how the ic will be physically implemented 
this data is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 
custom ic design our custom design products  which include the virtuoso custom design platform  are used for ics that must be designed at the transistor level  including analog  radio frequency  memories  high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries 
detailed design information showing how an ic will be physically implemented is used for creation of the photomasks used in chip manufacture 
system interconnect design this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products  including the allegro and orcad products 
the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co design of interconnects across ics  ic packages and pcbs  while the orcad line focuses on cost effective  entry level pcb solutions

for these arrangements  we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products by these customers 
the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and  if that proves to be the case  the revenue allocation in the above table would differ 
although we believe the methodology of allocating revenue to product groups is reasonable  there can be no assurance that such allocated amounts reflect the amounts that would result had the customer individually licensed each specific software solution at the onset of the arrangement

a summary of restructuring and other charges in fiscal years  and is as follows severance and asset excess benefits related facilities total in millions on october   we completed a lease termination agreement for a facility included in the restructuring plan  whereby we paid million and were released from all future obligations related to the facility 
we recorded a credit to restructuring and other charges of million during the year ended december   representing the lease loss accrual related to this facility in excess of the amount paid 
during  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million  which included million of workforce reduction costs associated primarily with our restructuring plan  and excess facility costs of million  which consisted primarily of changes in lease loss estimates for facilities included in our  and restructuring plans 
each reporting period  we evaluate the adequacy of the lease loss accrual 
we adjust the lease loss accrual for changes in real estate markets or other factors that may affect estimated costs or sublease income 
we also consider executed sublease agreements and adjust the lease loss accrual if sublease income under the agreement differs from initial estimates 
the credits recorded during and primarily relate to changes in lease loss estimates 
as of december   our total amount accrued for restructuring and other charges of million consisted solely of estimated lease losses related to the restructuring activities initiated since this amount may be adjusted in the future based upon changes in the assumptions used to estimate the lease loss

write off of acquired in process research and development upon consummation of an acquisition  we immediately charge to expense any acquired in process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
the value assigned to acquired in process research and development is determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established 
the values are determined by estimating costs to develop the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value

the internal revenue service  or irs  and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns 
in november  the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years through and issued a revenue agent s report  or rar  in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of approximately million 
the most significant of the disputed adjustments for the tax years through related to transfer pricing arrangements that we had with a foreign subsidiary 
in december  the joint committee on taxation of the us congress  or the joint committee  approved and the appeals office executed settlement agreements resulting in an effective settlement of the transfer pricing dispute for purposes of fin no 
as a result of this effective settlement  we recognized a tax benefit of million in our consolidated income statement 
we did not reach a settlement with the appeals office of the irs on separate tax refund claims that would increase our tax deductions for foreign trade income for the tax years through we continue to believe that our position is well supported and we are currently considering our options for further pursuing this matter 
in july  the irs completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years through and issued an rar in which the irs proposed to assess an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of approximately million 
in november  the irs revised the proposed aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period to be approximately million 
the irs is contesting our qualification for deferred recognition of certain proceeds received from restitution and settlement in connection with litigation during the period 
the proposed tax deficiency for this item is approximately million 
the remaining proposed tax deficiency of approximately million is primarily related to proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements that we had with foreign subsidiaries and to our deductions for foreign trade income 
the irs may make similar claims against our transfer pricing arrangements and deductions for foreign trade income in future examinations 
we have filed a timely protest with the irs and will seek resolution of the issues with the appeals office 
we believe that the proposed irs adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws and we are vigorously challenging these proposed adjustments 
the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency but the irs imposes interest on the proposed deficiencies until the matters are resolved 
interest is compounded daily at rates published

the calculation of our provision for income taxes involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  we regularly assess the potential settlement outcomes resulting from income tax examinations 
however  the final outcome of tax examinations  including the total amount payable or the timing of any such payments upon resolution of these issues  cannot be estimated with certainty 
in addition  we cannot be certain that such amount will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should the irs or other tax authorities assess additional taxes as a result of a current or a future examination  we may be required to record charges to operations in future periods that could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in the applicable period or periods

the initial conversion rate for the convertible senior notes is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
upon conversion  a holder will receive the sum of the daily settlement amounts  calculated on a proportionate basis for each day  during a specified observation period following the conversion date 
the daily settlement amount during each date of the observation period consists of cash up to the principal amount of the note  and our common stock to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the amount of cash paid upon conversion of the convertible senior notes 
in addition  if a fundamental change occurs prior to maturity  we will  in certain cases  increase the conversion rate by an additional amount up to per share  for a holder that elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with such fundamental change  which amount will be paid entirely in cash

in addition  we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after august  for of the principal amount  except for those notes that holders have required us to repurchase on august  or on other repurchase dates  as described above

in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in december  a portion of the proceeds were used to purchase in the open market notes with a principal balance of million for a total purchase price of million 
in connection with this purchase  we incurred expenses of million for the early 
table of contents extinguishment of debt 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt included the call premium on the purchased notes and the write off of a portion of the unamortized deferred debt issuance costs 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we entered into hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we originally acquired options to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
these options expire on august  and must be settled in net shares 
the cost of the hedge transactions to us was million 
in connection with the purchase of a portion of the notes in december  we also sold million of the hedges that were originally purchased in connection with the notes and received proceeds of million

contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period less more total than year years years than years in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations notes convertible senior notes contractual interest payments current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits other long term contractual obligations u total the notes are due in august however  the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of the notes on august  for of the principal amount 
therefore  we have included million of principal of the notes and million of premium on the potential repurchase of the notes in the less than year column in the above table 
u included in other long term contractual obligations are long term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million  and of that amount we estimate that million will be paid within to years 
we did not include the remaining long term income tax liabilities of million in the table above  because we estimated that this liability can be offset by available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and that future cash payments will not be required to settle this liability 
however  the total amounts of income tax payable and the timing of such tax payments may depend upon the resolution of current and future tax examinations which cannot be estimated with 
table of contents certainty 
the remaining portion of other long term contractual obligations is primarily acquisition related liabilities 
with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us  the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december  or the earliest cancellation date 
in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to december   we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash during the next months if certain predefined performance goals are achieved in full 
we expect that current cash and short term investment balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other capital requirements for at least the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents 
while we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates 
in this regard  changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
we invest in high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
as part of our policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond 
table of contents appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the short term interest bearing portfolio of cash and cash equivalents includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments with maturities greater than three months are classified as available for sale and are considered to be short term investments 
the carrying value of our interest bearing instruments approximated fair value as of december  the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our interest bearing instruments  which are all classified as cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  carrying average value interest rate in millions interest bearing instruments cash variable rate cash equivalents variable rate cash equivalents fixed rate total interest bearing instruments foreign currency risk most of our revenue  expenses and material business activity are transacted in the united states dollar 
however  certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies and  therefore  we benefit from a weaker dollar  and in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency  we are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a weakening united states dollar is an increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in expenses 
conversely  the primary effect of foreign currency transactions on our results of operations from a strengthening united states dollar is a reduction in revenue offset by a smaller reduction in expenses 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
conversely  a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and  therefore  the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income  net  in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 
our policy governing hedges of foreign currency risk does not allow us to use forward contracts for trading purposes 
our forward contracts generally have maturities of days or less 
the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate future asset and liability exposures 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures 
recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 
the following table provides information  as of december   about our forward foreign currency contracts 
the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts 
the table presents the notional amounts  at contract exchange rates  and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar  which in some cases may not be the market

investments we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non marketable equity securities 
our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program 
under our strategic investment program  from time to time we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 

table of contents the fair value of our portfolio of available for sale marketable equity securities  which are included in short term investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  was million as of december  and million as of december  while we actively monitor these investments  we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to these equity investments 
accordingly  we could lose all or part of our investment portfolio of marketable equity securities if there is an adverse change in the market prices of the companies we invest in 
our investments in non marketable equity securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
such a change  or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose non marketable securities we own  would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings  acquisitions and private sales 
these types of investments involve a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or will be successful or that we will be able to liquidate a particular investment when desired 
accordingly  we could lose all or part of our investment 
our investments in non marketable equity securities had a carrying amount of million as of december  and million as of december  if we determine that an other than temporary decline in fair value exists for a non marketable equity security  we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write down as an investment loss in our consolidated income statements
