item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a development stage medical device company focused on developing and commercializing our proprietary custom nx des systems to treat coronary artery disease  or cad 
since inception we have devoted substantially all of our resources to start up activities  raising capital and research and development  including product design  testing  manufacturing and clinical trials 
we have focused our development efforts on creating our custom nx des systems  which allow a physician to deploy single or multiple stents of customizable length with a single device 
we have not yet received any government regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize any of our products 
we are conducting clinical trials to evaluate our custom nx and custom nx stent and stent delivery systems 
in october  the two year clinical data from our custom i clinical trial and the one year clinical data from our custom ii clinical trial were presented at the transcatheter cardiovascular therapeutics conference in washington dc in july  we completed enrollment of our custom iii clinical trial which is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of in situ customization with our stents  particularly in patients with long lesions and multiple lesions 
we believe the data from these clinical trials provided preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy and supports further development of our in situ customization approach 
we will need ce mark in the european union in order to commercialize our products in the european union and certain other countries that recognize ce mark 
in december  we submitted our application for ce mark to our european notified body using the data from our custom i  ii and iii clinical trials 
in march of  our notified body informed us that we will receive a response to our ce mark application in may of we will need premarket approval  or pma  from the us food and drug administration  or fda  before we can market our products in the united states  which we expect will require data from large clinical trials of up to  patients 
to initiate our custom iv trial  we must first obtain clearance of an investigational device exemption  or ide  from the fda 
in september  we applied for our ide and in october we received questions back from the fda regarding our ide application 
we are currently working to address the fda s questions and will not be able to obtain ide approval or initiate our custom iv trial until we do so 
in anticipation of approval of our products  we plan to increase our manufacturing capacity and personnel to enable us to produce commercial quantities of our products 
we anticipate that it will take time to increase our capacity and  as a result  expansion will be initiated prior to the anticipated approval of our products 
prior to obtaining regulatory approval  we may also begin to hire sales and marketing personnel 
following ce mark approval in the european union  we intend to commercialize our custom nx des systems in key markets in both europe and asia pacific 
we expect to rely on third party distributors  with our sales and clinical support  in select markets in europe  all of asia pacific and the rest of the world 
following fda approval  we expect to market our products in the united states through a direct sales force 
to date  we have not generated any revenue from our development activities and will not be able to generate revenue until one of our products is approved  if ever 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in june through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue to increase as we expand our clinical trial activities and initiate commercialization activities 
since inception we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities 
in may and june  we raised aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million in a private placement of shares of our series d convertible preferred stock 
on february  we completed our initial public offering of our common stock which raised net proceeds of million 
we plan to raise additional capital in through the sale of equity or debt securities or by obtaining a credit facility 
in may  we entered into a license agreement with biosensors 
pursuant to the agreement  we obtained worldwide non exclusive rights to use biosensors s drug coating on our products  and agreed to pay specified minimum royalties and royalties based on net sales of our products 
in december  we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with biosensors 
pursuant to the original agreement  biosensors formulated the drug coating and we purchased the drug coating from them 
under the restated agreement  we have the right to purchase the drug and polymer components separately and formulate the coating ourselves 
at this time  we have not completed the work necessary to perform the formulation ourselves and continue to purchase the drug coating formulated by biosensors 
financial operations revenue to date  we have not generated any revenue from the sale of our stent systems 
we do not expect to generate revenue until the second half of at the earliest  subject to obtaining ce mark 
research and development since inception  we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our custom nx des systems 
we expect our research and development expenditures to increase as we continue to devote significant resources to developing our products  in particular  completing the clinical trials necessary to support regulatory approval 
from our inception through december   we incurred million in research and development expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  finance  marketing and administrative personnel including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include professional fees for accounting and legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain protection for intellectual property related to our custom nx des systems 
from our inception through december   we incurred million in general and administrative expenses 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
we did not generate any revenue during the years ended december  or research and development years ended december  dollar change in thousands research and development expenses    the million increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase of million for prototype parts  supplies  and outside services related to product development for our custom nx des systems  net of a million decrease in non employee stock based compensation  an increase of million in personnel costs related to the hiring of additional employees in our research and development and manufacturing departments  an increase of million in expenses related to the support of our clinical research studies  an increase of million in depreciation on equipment and facilities costs as we expanded our manufacturing capacity  and an increase of million in employee stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in patent and licensing fees in the year ended december  we did not make a license payment to these two licensors during the year ended december  we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly as we continue the development of our custom nx des systems and conduct additional clinical trials 
general and administrative years ended december  dollar change in thousands general and administrative expenses    the million increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase of million in personnel costs related to the hiring of additional employees in our finance and administration and marketing departments  an increase of million in employee stock based compensation expense  an increase of million in consulting  legal and professional services associated with operating as a public company  an increase of million due to spending for trade shows  travel and marketing materials  and an increase of million in insurance and other administrative expenses associated with operating as a public company 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in accounting fees in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  higher accounting fees were incurred during the year ended december  while preparing for our initial public offering in february these increases were also partially offset by a million decrease in compensation costs in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due to a million relocation bonus that was paid to our chief financial officer in april we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly due to the costs associated with the commercialization of our products 
interest and other income  net years ended december  dollar change in thousands interest and other income  net    the million increase in interest and other income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in the levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of our initial public offering in february income taxes 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for our net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income  if any  for federal and california state income tax purposes 
the federal income tax net operating loss carry forward begins expiring in  and the california state income tax net operating loss carry forward begins expiring in as of december   we had research and development credit carry forwards of approximately million and million available to reduce future taxable income  if any  for federal and california state income tax purposes  respectively 
the federal income tax research and development credits carry forwards begin expiring in  and the california state income tax research and development credits carry forward indefinitely 
section of the internal revenue code generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
we have internally reviewed the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by section caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and believe such limitations should not be significant 
future ownership changes  including changes resulting from any future sales of our equity securities  may adversely affect our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carry forwards 
if our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards is limited  we may be subject to tax on our income earlier than we would otherwise be had we been able to fully utilize our net operating loss carry forwards 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
we did not generate any revenue during the years ended december  or research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due to higher personnel expenses of million for additional employees hired in our research and development department  million for prototype parts  supplies  and outside services related to product development for our custom nx des systems   due to increased spending on clinical research studies and  due to increased depreciation on equipment and facilities expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due to higher personnel expenses of million for additional employees hired in marketing and administration   due to increased spending for consulting  trade shows and marketing materials  and million due to increased legal and professional expenses 
interest income 
interest income was  for  compared to million for the increase of  was due primarily to higher cash balances for as well as a modest increase in interest rates 
beneficial conversion feature 
in january  we completed the issuance and sale of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock at per share  which price was determined by our board of directors pursuant to negotiations with the investors in that round of financing 
in june  we completed the issuance and sale of  shares of series d convertible preferred stock at per share  which price was determined by our board of directors pursuant to negotiations with a new investor and existing investors in that round of financing 
in connection with our preparation of the financial statements necessary for our public offering  we reassessed the fair value of our common stock for financial accounting purposes 
based on this reassessment  we determined the fair value of our common stock in january to be per share  in may to be per share and in june to be per share 
when we issue equity securities that are convertible into common stock at a discount from the common fair value at the commitment date  the difference between the fair value of the common stock and the conversion price multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion is recognized as a beneficial conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion feature is presented as a deemed dividend to the related security holders with an offsetting amount to additional paid in capital and will be amortized over the period from the issue date to the first conversion date 
since the equity securities are immediately convertible into common stock by the holder at any time  we recorded and immediately amortized a beneficial conversion charge  or deemed dividend  of approximately million in connection with our series c convertible preferred stock financing in january  and approximately million in connection with our series d convertible preferred stock financing in may and june upon completion of the company s initial public offering on february   all of the company s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock converted on a one to one basis into  shares of common stock 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments balances as of december  and december  are summarized as follows as of december  as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents   short term investments  total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  sources of liquidity we are in the development stage and have incurred losses since our inception in june as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
prior to our initial public offering  we funded our operations from the private placements of our convertible preferred stock resulting in aggregate net proceeds of million through december  on february   we completed our initial public offering  raising million in net proceeds 
we plan to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility during the process of developing our products will continue to require significant research and development  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
these activities  together with increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  as we prepare for a commercial launch of our products in europe  are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the next several years 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding or available debt financing arrangements  we had working capital of million  and our primary source of liquidity was million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
summary of cash flows our operating  investing and financing activities for the year ended december  and december  are summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities   net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december  and december  primarily reflects expenses related to product development and clinical trials 
these expenses were offset in part by depreciation and amortization  non cash stock based compensation and non cash changes in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was attributable to the purchase of short term investments of million and the purchase of property and equipment of million  which were partially offset by the proceeds from the maturities of investments of million and the proceeds from the sale of investments of million 
the net cash used to purchase investments during the year ended december  was derived from the cash raised by our initial public offering in february net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment totaling million  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in restricted cash related to a patent application submitted by cardiosafe  ltd 
we did not have any investments in the year ended december  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to our initial public offering in february net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products 
we do not anticipate generating any revenue unless and until we successfully obtain ce mark or fda marketing approval for  and begin selling  our custom nx des systems 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we develop our products  conduct and complete clinical trials  pursue additional applications for our technology platform  expand our clinical development team and corporate infrastructure  and prepare for the potential commercial launch of our products 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and interest income we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through december  we plan to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility during any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
for example  we will need to raise additional funds in order to build our sales force and commercialize our products 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned clinical trials  research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
we anticipate spending approximately million to complete our custom iv and v clinical trials 
in addition  we will spend additional funds for regulatory approvals and for activities to commercialize our custom nx des systems  if approved 
the development of any new applications of our custom length stent technology and new products will also require the expenditure of significant financial resources and take several years to complete 
our forecasts for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to complete development of products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors contained in item a of part i of this report 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our custom nx des systems  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete ongoing clinical trials and successfully deliver a commercial product to market 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending  in litigation or otherwise  any claims that we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our products and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and licensing technologies for future development 
future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total to to and later in thousands operating lease   minimum royalty obligations  total   the long term commitments under operating leases shown above consist of payments related to our real estate lease in menlo park  california  which was amended in may  extending the term of the lease through may  we may terminate the lease for any reason on or after may   and the landlord may terminate the lease on or after that date provided that the landlord has obtained certain redevelopment rights with respect to the leased premises 
the minimum royalty payments that are listed above consist of payments related to license agreements we have with biosensors and surmodics 
the total royalty payments for these licenses are based on our net revenues and therefore have no maximum 
to date  we have paid  in royalty payments 
in addition  we have contingent payments that are payable to two other licensors upon the achievement of certain milestones  and have paid  in milestone payments to date under both of these agreements 
there could be an additional  in milestone payments if all milestones are achieved 
in april  we entered into a supply agreement with fortimedix bv  under which fortimedix bv agreed to manufacture and deliver stents for use in our products 
the terms of the agreement required minimum purchases over two years at contractual prices set in euros 
as of december   million had been paid or accrued for purchases under this supply agreement 
based on the contract  any further purchase commitments have been delayed until we receive approval from the fda to begin clinical trials in the united states 
in december  we entered into the amended and restated license agreement with biosensors international group  ltd  under which we purchase the drug and polymer components for our drug coating 
our purchase commitments to biosensors totaled approximately  as of december  in october  we entered into a contract research organization agreement with bailer research  inc  under which bailer will provide certain monitoring services with respect to our planned us clinical trial which is expected to begin in the commitment under this contract is estimated to between to million over a period of months 
payments will be made in installments based on trial related milestones  and will begin when approval is received from the fda to begin the clinical trial 
in january  we entered into a contract with cardiovascular research foundation crf under which crf will perform certain data coordination and analysis services in connection with our planned clinical trial in the united states 
we estimate that we will pay a total of to million to crf over a period of approximately months 
payments will be made in installments based on related trial milestones 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities as defined in regulation s k item a 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical trial expenses  comprised of payments for work performed by participating trial centers 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
the costs of our clinical trials are contractually determined based on the nature of the services to be provided 
we accrue expenses for clinical trials based on estimates of work performed under our clinical trial contracts 
these estimates are based on information provided by participating clinical trial centers 
if the information provided is incomplete or inaccurate  we may underestimate expenses at a given point in time 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from actual costs 
stock based compensation beginning on january   we began accounting for stock options granted to employees under the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which require the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
through december   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and related interpretations 
for periods prior to january   we have complied with the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
under apb no 
 we recognize stock based compensation expense when we issue employee stock option grants at exercise prices that  for financial reporting purposes  are deemed to be below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist that we could rely on during this period 
instead  we relied on our board of directors  which includes several venture capitalists who have considerable experience in the valuation of emerging companies and several members with extensive experience in the medical device industry 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock and uncertainty prior to the second quarter of as to whether we would pursue an initial public offering  our board of directors  with input from management  determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors  including the grants involved illiquid securities in a private company  the options to acquire shares of our common stock were subject to vesting  generally vesting over a four year period  our performance and the status of our research and development efforts  our stage of development and business strategy  including the status and timing of expected ce mark clearance and our pma submission with the fda and the likelihood and timing of product launch  the composition and changes in the management team  including the need to recruit additional members  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of our common stock  such as an initial public offering or sale of our company  given market conditions  and the market prices of comparable publicly held medical device companies 
in accordance with the preparation of financial statements necessary for our initial public offering  we reassessed the estimated fair value of our common stock 
in accordance with the requirements of apb no 
through december   we have recorded deferred stock based compensation expense for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options granted during the year ended december  and the reassessed fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant and we amortize that amount over the vesting period of the stock options and include it as a component of stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted  modified and settled to our employees and directors after january  during  we granted stock options to employees to purchase approximately  shares of common stock with a weighted average grant date fair value of per share under the black scholes valuation model 
as of december   we had total unrecognized stock based compensation costs of approximately million arising from stock option grants through december   which is expected to be amortized as follows in thousands year ending december  year ending december  year ending december  year ending december  determining the reassessed fair value of our common stock required our board of directors and management to make complex and subjective judgments  assumptions and estimates  which involved inherent uncertainty 
had our board of directors and management used different assumptions and estimates  the resulting fair value of our common stock and the resulting stock based compensation expense could have been different 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf no 

eitf no 
requires nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf no 
is effective for us in the year beginning january  the adoption of eitf no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas sfas no 

sfas no 
allows companies to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements 
sfas no 
is effective for us in the year beginning january  and will be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes the framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  on december   the fasb issued proposed fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp will partially defer the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for the year beginning january   we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed fsp fas b 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and us government securities 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted primarily of liquid money market accounts and certificates of deposits 
our short term investments as of december  consisted primarily of commercial paper  us government securities and corporate bonds 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk 
exchange rate risk under our supply agreement with fortimedix  we have market risk exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the cost of the stents we purchase from fortimedix requires payment in euros 
fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate therefore impacts the cost of our product 
to date  we have not experienced any significant negative foreign exchange transaction losses 
we expect higher product costs due to a decline in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro 
as a policy  we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
if we expand our overseas operations  our operating results may become subject to more significant fluctuations based on changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will periodically analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may adjust our policies to address any future potential exchange rate risk
