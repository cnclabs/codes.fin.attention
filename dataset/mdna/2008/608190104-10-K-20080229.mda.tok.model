critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

table of contents the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility can be reasonably assured 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost has been determined using the first in first out method fifo 
costs included in inventory include raw materials  direct and indirect labor and employee benefits  depreciation  general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage  anticipated future selling price  expected sales below cost  excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory  excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and market value approaches for the fair value determination of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and  therefore  could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the useful life of a definite lived intangible asset is based on assumptions and judgments made by management at the time of acquisition 
changes in these judgments and assumptions that could include a loss of customers  a change in the assessment of future operations or a prolonged economic downturn could materially change the value of the definite lived intangible assets and  therefore  could materially impact the company s financial statements 
the company s tax rate is based on its income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s tax expense and in evaluating the company s tax positions 
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period 
the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely on estimates  including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time 
in the event that the company is not able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future a valuation allowance is provided 
the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has 
table of contents full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings  as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable  the company consults with its internal experts 
the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it
