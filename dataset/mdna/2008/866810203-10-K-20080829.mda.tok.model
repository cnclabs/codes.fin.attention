products net revenue logo 
table of contents products net revenue consists of revenue generated from the sales of computer systems and storage products 
we distribute our products to end users through a combination of direct sales through our global sales and services organization and through our independent distributors 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we introduced programs in certain geographic markets entitling our distributors to a reduced price on hardware when sold to the end customer with a support services contract 
accordingly  in these cases  we are no longer able to meet the criteria for revenue recognition under us generally accepted accounting principles at the time of sale to our distributors 
we have deferred revenue on these sales until our distributors sell the hardware to the end customer 
we introduced these programs in the us and parts of europe  the middle east  africa and asia during fiscal as a result of these programs  our products revenue was adversely impacted by approximately million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease in computer systems products net revenue during fiscal of million  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the change to certain distributor programs described above 
there was a corresponding increase in deferred products revenue over the same time period 
in addition  we experienced decreased sales of our traditional volume sparc based server products  decreased sales of our x based rack server products and decreased sales of our mid range server products 
decreased sales of our traditional volume sparc based server products were due to reduced customer demand as products are near their end of life eol 
decreased sales of our x based rack server products were primarily due to the delayed introduction of amd quad core based products 
decreased sales of our mid range server products were primarily due to a partial shift to volume products and due to certain of our products nearing their eol 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our cmt volume server products  increased sales of our blade server products and increased sales of our recently introduced olympus product line opl server products 
increased sales of our cmt volume server products and our blade server products were primarily the result of continued acceptance of our products based on the ultrasparc t plus processor 
the increase in storage products net revenue during fiscal of million  as compared to fiscal  was due to increased sales of enterprise and mid range disk products  increased sales of connectivity products and increased sales of tape media 
increased sales of enterprise disk products were due to recent product introductions  including the se enterprise disk model 
increased sales of mid range disk products were due to the improved functionality and scalability of the st and st product models and sales initiatives 
increased sales of our connectivity products were driven by increased sales of our enterprise and mid range disk products 
increased sales of our tape media products were due to the increase in our installed base 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of our enterprise and oem tape drive products and virtual storage manager vsm mainframe products 
decreased sales of our enterprise and oem tape drive products were primarily due to delayed product introductions 
decreased sales of our vsm mainframe products were primarily due to the competitive and declining mainframe market 
the increase in computer systems products revenue during fiscal of million  as compared to fiscal  was due to increased sales of our cmt entry level volume server products  increased sales of our x based server products and increased sales of our data center enterprise server products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales of certain sparc based server products and decreased sales of our mid range enterprise server products 
during fiscal  we drove down the worldwide level of product inventory at our channel partners 
this reduction in channel inventory adversely impacted products revenue by approximately million in fiscal the decrease in storage products revenue during fiscal of million  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to decreased sales of data center and entry level disk storage products  decreased sales of our enterprise tape drive products and decreased sales of our virtual tape products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of high end library tape products  mid range disk storage products and the inclusion of storagetek revenues for the full fiscal year 
declines in storage revenues were generally due to product market competition and product age

accordingly  the following quantification of the reasons for the change in the products gross margin percentage is an estimate only 
products gross margin increased by approximately one percentage point during fiscal  as compared to fiscal decreasing material costs and our supply chain restructuring efforts combined to increase gross margin by approximately ten percentage points 
offsetting this increase was the impact of pricing and discounting actions by approximately nine percentage points 
products gross margin increased by approximately three percentage points during fiscal  as compared to fiscal products gross margin increased by five percentage points due to decreasing material costs primarily memory components and our supply chain restructuring efforts and two percentage points due to favorable changes in volume and mix including a higher percentage of software sales  offset by a four percentage point decrease due to pricing  discounting and other actions 
there can be no assurance that the current gross margin percentage will be maintained 
in general  gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to the variety of factors listed above  especially continued industry wide global pricing pressures  a potential shift in product mix and increases in the cost and availability of components 
we may continue to take pricing actions with regard to our products in response to the competitive environment 
we do however believe that our gross margins will remain relatively stable for the fiscal period

in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  which are predominantly short term fixed income instruments

the tax expense included a reduction in the us valuation allowance that is credited to other balance sheet accounts and therefore did not benefit the income tax expense 
the tax provision for fiscal was also impacted by a reduction in foreign tax expense as a result of repaying intercompany loans of certain international subsidiaries that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a tax expense of million which was primarily related to taxes due on income generated in our foreign tax jurisdictions 
the foreign tax expense is net of a benefit of million recorded for the reduction in accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of restructuring of certain european subsidiaries as well as a benefit of million due to a tax law change in germany 
the us tax benefit reflects a benefit of million primarily relating to the settlement of the internal revenue service income tax audit for fiscal and  and a benefit associated with adjusting estimated amounts to actual liabilities resulting from the filing of the fy us tax return 
this us benefit was offset by the utilization of acquisition net operating losses  increases to various tax reserves  and foreign withholding taxes

table of contents we currently have provided a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets and a full or partial valuation allowance on certain overseas deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
likewise  the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to our foreign deferred tax assets could result in an increase to the valuation allowance 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowance 
we have also provided adequate amounts for other anticipated tax audit adjustments in the us  state and foreign tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest may be due 
in addition  although specific foreign country transfer pricing exposures have not been identified  the risk of potential adjustment exists 
if our estimate of the federal  state and foreign income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense could result 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the liabilities would be reversed  and any related tax benefits would be recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary

at the end of fiscal  dso was worse by six days  compared to the end of fiscal  primarily due to the timing of billings associated with service contract renewals 
our products inventory turn rate decreased by points from june  dpo improved by two days  primarily due to cost savings in areas that reduced our cost of sales but had a lesser impact on the accounts payable balance 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy 
typically  the significant majority of our integration activities related to an acquisition are substantially complete in the us within six to twelve months after the closing of the acquisition 
integration activities for international operations  particularly in europe  generally take longer 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of mysql ab mysql  a company based in uppsala  sweden  for approximately million including million in cash  assumed employee stock options with a fair value using the black scholes model of approximately million and transaction costs of million 
the options assumed in the acquisition were converted into options to purchase million shares of our common stock 
mysql provides open source and proprietary database technology and software as well as services  to a wide range of customers in different industry segments and stages of growth 
the results of operations of mysql are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
stock repurchases and repurchase plans in may  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding common stock 
under this authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and 
table of contents are contingent on a number of factors  such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions  repayment of debt and our share price 
during the fiscal year ended june  we repurchased approximately million shares  or billion  of common stock under this repurchase authorization 
during the fiscal year ended june  we repurchased approximately million shares or million of common stock under the may repurchase authorization 
during fiscal year  we did not repurchase common stock under our prior repurchase authorization announced in february  which was canceled at the inception of the new plan 
all repurchases were made in compliance with rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
on july   our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional billion of our outstanding common stock 
under this authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors  such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions  repayment of debt and our share price 
contractual obligations and contingencies the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at june  in millions contractual obligations total payments due in less than year payments due in years payments due in years payments due after years senior notes convertible notes non cancelable operating leases purchasing and manufacturing commitments outsourced services commitments interest on senior and convertible notes defined benefit plans asset retirement obligations other obligations total contractual obligations other obligations include uncertain tax positions 
we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments of million of uncertain tax positions and therefore these have been excluded from the table 
borrowings in august  we issued billion of unsecured senior debt securities in four tranches the senior notes of which million due on august  and bearing interest at remain 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually 
we may redeem all or any part of the senior notes at any time at a price equal to of the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition to an amount determined by a quotation agent  representing the present value of the remaining scheduled payments 
the senior notes are subject to compliance with certain covenants that do not contain financial ratios 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
in addition  we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of the senior notes so that the interest associated with the senior notes effectively becomes variable 
for our publicly traded senior notes  estimates of fair value are based on market prices 
for our other debt  fair value is calculated based on rates currently estimated to be available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
our board of directors has authorized our management to repurchase senior note debt from time to time in partial or in full tranches based on availability of cash and market conditions 
as of june   we have not repurchased any debt 
in january  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due february  and million principal amount of convertible senior notes due february  the convertible notes  to kkr pei solar holdings  i  ltd  kkr pei solar holdings  ii  ltd 
and citibank  na in a private placement 
each  of principal of the convertible notes is convertible into shares of our common stock or a total of approximately million shares  which is the equivalent of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth under terms of the convertible notes 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into note hedge transactions with a financial institution whereby we have the option to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a price of per share and we sold warrants to the same financial institution whereby they have the option to purchase up to million shares of our common stock 
the separate note hedge and warrant transactions were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the convertible notes 

table of contents other commitments we utilize several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub assemblies for our products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by us 
we also obtain individual components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers 
we acquire components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information 
such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead times and or commercially standard lead times for the particular part or product 
we estimate that these contractual obligations at june  were no more than million and are due in less than one year from june  this amount does not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities 
additionally  we have committed to purchase certain outsourced services where we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled prior to a contractual minimum term 
we estimate that our contractual obligations associated with outsourced services at june  were no more than million 
the interest on our senior notes reflects the net interest payment after consideration of interest rate swap agreements that effectively makes the interest expense variable 
our variable interest rate calculation uses the three month libor rate of approximately as of june  the interest rate on our convertible notes is mentioned above 
under our defined benefit plans we currently project our current obligation to be million using a weighted average discount rate of 
our asset retirement obligations arise from leased facilities where we have contractual commitments to remove leasehold improvements and return the property to a specified condition when the lease terminates 
other liabilities includes uncertain tax positions reduced us deferred tax assets 
we maintain a program of insurance with third party insurers for certain property  casualty and other risks 
the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self insurance basis 
we retain risk with regard to i certain loss events  such as california earthquakes and the indemnification or defense payments we  as a company  may make to or on behalf of our directors and officers as a result of obligations under applicable agreements  our by laws and applicable law  ii potential liabilities under a number of health and welfare insurance plans that we sponsor for our employees and iii other potential liabilities that are not insured 
the types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location  depending on availability  cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 
our worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions 
we reserve for loss accruals  which are primarily calculated using actuarial methods 
these loss accruals include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
during the normal course of our business  we issue guarantees and letters of credit to numerous third parties and for various purposes such as lease obligations  performance guarantees and state and local governmental agency requirements 
at june   we had approximately million of outstanding financial letters of credit 
in the normal course of business  we may enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on our behalf or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnifications have not been material 
in addition  we have uncommitted lines of credit aggregating approximately million 
no amounts were drawn from these lines of credit as of june  interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country depending on local market conditions at the time of borrowing 
there is no guarantee that the banks would approve our request for funds under these uncommitted lines of credit 
in fiscal  the gsa began auditing our records under the agreements it had with us at that time 
a lawsuit related to the audit and our performance under our gsa contract and other government contracts has been filed against us in the united states district court for the district of arkansas 
it includes claims under the federal false claims and anti kickback acts  as well as breach of contract and other claims  including claims related to certain rebates  discounts and other payments or benefits provided by us to our resellers and technology integrators 
the parties continue to discuss the nature of the government s current and potential claims on our gsa and other government sales 
if this matter proceeds to trial  possible sanctions include an award of damages  including treble damages  fines  penalties and other sanctions  up to and including suspension or debarment from sales to the federal government 
although we are interested in pursuing an amicable resolution  we intend to present a vigorous factual and legal defense throughout the course of these proceedings 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue for contingencies when we believe that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss 
we have made an assessment of the probability of incurring any such losses and such amounts are reflected in our condensed 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and it is difficult to predict the outcome of particular matters with reasonable certainty  and therefore  the actual amount of any loss may prove to be larger or smaller than the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  as part of our service based sales arrangement involving a governmental institution in mexico  we were required to issue three guarantee bonds 
the total amount of the bonds was approximately million 
the bonds were to be used as collateral guaranteeing our performance under the arrangement 
the bonds required a security deposit of million  paid to surety companies  which was classified as other non current assets  net  in our june  consolidated balance sheet 
in fiscal  the security deposit of million was returned to us and replaced with a cash secured letter of credit of million 
the deposit of million used to secure the letter of credit is classified as other non current assets  net  in our june  consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
capital resources and financial condition our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents in subsidiaries for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
at june   our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to billion 
our remaining investments of billion were held in marketable debt securities 
our cash and marketable debt securities position at june   was approximately billion 
we believe that the liquidity provided by existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable debt securities and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next months 
we believe our level of financial resources is a significant competitive factor in our industry and we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate growth and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities that arise 
critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item describes the significant accounting policies and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  however  to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and our actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below reflect our more significant assumptions  estimates and judgments and are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we enter into agreements to sell hardware  software  services and multiple deliverable arrangements that include combinations of products and or services 
additionally  while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables if there are multiple deliverables  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collectibility is reasonably assured  which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 

table of contents we recognize revenue as work progresses on fixed price professional services contracts when we can reliably evaluate progress to completion 
we perform periodic analyses of these contracts in order to determine if the applicable estimates regarding total revenue  total cost and the extent of progress toward completion require revision 
for fixed price professional services contracts  when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss  the estimated loss is recognized in the period the loss becomes evident 
changes in assumptions underlying these estimates and costs could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition and loss recognition 
distributors selling our high end products generally purchase our products at the time an end user is identified 
distributors selling our higher volume products may carry our products as inventory 
we recognize revenue when we sell to our distributors only if all applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
these criteria include the price to the buyer being substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale and the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated 
the revenue we recognize associated with channel sales transactions may require us to make estimates in several areas including the likelihood of returns  the amount of credits we will give for subsequent changes in our price list ie  price protection  the amount of credits we will give for additional discounts in certain competitive transactions ie  margin protection  the amount of stock rotation  and the creditworthiness of the distributors 
when applicable  we reduce revenue in these areas using assumptions that are based on our historical experience 
changes in these assumptions could require us to make significant revisions to our estimates that could materially impact the amount of net revenue recognized 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we introduced programs in certain geographic markets entitling our distributors to a reduced price on hardware when sold to the end customer with a support services contract 
accordingly  in these cases  we are no longer able to meet the criteria for revenue recognition under us gaap at the time of sale to our distributors 
we have deferred revenue on these sales until our distributors sell the hardware to the end customer 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as iprd based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by the company and our competitors  individual product sales cycles  the estimated lives of each of the products underlying technology  future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
to estimate restructuring liabilities  management utilized assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of costs associated with the disposition of duplicate or excess acquired facilities 
decreases to the estimates of currently approved acquisition related restructuring plans are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely  whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter 
goodwill our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology industry 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we allocate goodwill to our various businesses to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of our businesses to which goodwill relates based on future expected discounted cash flows income approach  and determine the carrying value book value of those businesses  as some of the assets and liabilities related to those businesses  such as property and equipment and accounts receivable  are not held by those businesses but by functional departments for example  our global sales and services organization and worldwide operations organization 
prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units  we are required to assess long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  impairment of long lived assets sfas 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular business  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all 
table of contents identifiable assets and liabilities of the business  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of any goodwill impairment determined 
we perform our goodwill impairment analysis at one level below the operating segment level as defined in sfas the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets such as accounts receivable and property and equipment to the balance sheet for those businesses 
we also consider our market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
at june   our goodwill had a carrying value of billion 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analyses in the fourth quarter of each of fiscal  and based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows as well as our market capitalization  at each of these dates  we concluded that goodwill impairment charges were not necessary in fiscal  and other long lived assets sfas is the authoritative standard on the accounting for the impairment of other long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas and our internal accounting policy  we perform tests for impairment of intangible assets other than goodwill other intangible assets semi annually and whenever events or circumstances suggest that other intangible assets may be impaired 
this analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the intangible asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
we have estimated the fair value of other intangible assets using the income approach to value these identifiable intangible assets which are subject to amortization 
at june   we had other intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
these other intangible assets consist of million in acquisition related intangible assets and million in intangible assets primarily associated with patent licenses acquired through our settlement with kodak 
to evaluate potential impairment  sfas requires us to assess whether the future cash flows related to these assets will be greater than their carrying value at the time of the test 
accordingly  while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to our other intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets we have engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions and activities associated with productivity improvement initiatives and expense reduction measures  which are accounted for under sfas  employers accounting for post employment benefits sfas and sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
our restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant  obsolete or excess  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
the amounts we have accrued represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur in connection with these actions  but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
defined benefit pension plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions sfas as amended by sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
this determination involves the selection of various assumptions  including an expected rate of return on plan assets and a discount rate 
a key assumption in determining our net pension expense in accordance with sfas is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
we apply our expected rate of return 
table of contents to a market related value of assets  which stabilizes variability in the amounts to which we apply that expected return 
while we give appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns  the assumptions are primarily long term  prospective rates of return 
changes in the expected long term rate could materially impact the expense and liabilities or assets recognized associated with our pension plans 
another key assumption in determining our net pension expense is the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan obligations 
we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans at their respective measurement dates to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to address projected future benefits 
changes in the expected long term rate could materially impact the expense and liabilities or assets recognized association with our pension plans 
income taxes on july   we adopted fin see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we currently have provided a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets and a full or partial valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain these valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of a valuation allowance in a specific taxing jurisdiction 
likewise  the occurrence of negative evidence with respect to certain of our foreign deferred tax assets could result in an increase to the valuation allowance 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowances 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  we have applied the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
in our accounting for statement r 

table of contents we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
in addition  to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
as required by statement r  we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments issued or assumed after june  that are expected to vest 
for all share based payments granted or assumed beginning june   we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award  which is generally four years 
the fair value of the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to june  is recognized over the remaining service period using the accelerated expense attribution method  net of estimated forfeitures 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated  forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates 
stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly 
we also consider  each quarter  whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we use the combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility of our publicly traded  longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical or implied volatility on a stand alone basis 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates of employee groups by job classification 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a description of certain other recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
non audit services of independent registered public accounting firm our audit committee has pre approved all non audit services including tax compliance services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at june  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate sensitivity our debt investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income instruments with an average duration of years  years and years as of june   and  respectively 
the decrease in the average duration of our portfolio at june   as compared to june   was due to the decision to maintain short positions in anticipation of the stock 
table of contents repurchase program and due to the liquidation of securities in order to repatriate billion of foreign earnings 
the increase in the average duration of our portfolio at june   as compared to june   was due to the increase in our average cash and marketable debt security positions 
the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the fair market value of these securities may fluctuate with changes in interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on this investment portfolio based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical fair market value changes using a three month horizon that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus basis points bps 
based on this analysis  for example  a hypothetical bps increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments in debt securities as of june   as compared with a million decrease as of june  we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of the senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively becomes variable and thus matches the shorter term rates received from our cash and marketable securities 
accordingly  interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our senior notes outstanding  which will be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements 
however  by entering into these swap agreements  we have a cash flow exposure related to the risk that interest rates may increase 
for example  at june   a hypothetical bps increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are primarily transacted in us dollars 
however  since a portion of our operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities outside the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  can benefit from a weaker dollar and can be adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our consolidated sales and operating margins as expressed in us dollars 
to minimize currency exposure gains and losses  we often borrow funds in local currencies  enter into forward exchange contracts  purchase foreign currency options and promote natural hedges by purchasing components and incurring expenses in local currencies 
currently  we have no plans to discontinue our hedging programs  however  we continually evaluate the benefits of our hedging strategies and may choose to discontinue them in the future 
based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at june   we estimate a maximum potential one day loss in fair value of approximately million  as compared with million as of june   using a value at risk var model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
we used a monte carlo simulation type model that valued foreign currency instruments against three thousand randomly generated market price paths 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk estimation tool and as such is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us 
additionally  as we utilize foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
equity security price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of equity investments 
these investments are generally in companies in the high technology industry sector  many of which are small capitalization stocks 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale equity investments as of june   as compared with million as of june  at june  and  two equity securities represented substantially all of the million and million total fair value of the marketable equity securities  respectively 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion on our marketable equity securities
