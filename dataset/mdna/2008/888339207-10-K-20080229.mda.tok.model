part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation was formed in and was incorporated in delaware in unless otherwise indicated  references in this report to we  us or our refer to timet and its subsidiaries  taken as a whole 
we are one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted and mill products 
we are the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium consumption 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  and a major recycler of titanium scrap 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications where these qualities satisfy essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium  other end use applications for titanium in military and industrial markets have continued to develop  including the use of titanium based alloys in armor plating  structural components  chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with diverse uses including oil and gas production installations  automotive  geothermal facilities and architectural applications 
our products include titanium sponge  melted products  mill products and industrial fabrications 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like us  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
our long term strategy is to maximize the value of our core aerospace business while expanding our presence in non aerospace markets and developing new applications and products 
in the near term  we intend to continue to utilize our operating cash flow and capital resources to support increased levels of investment in the expansion of our productive capacity and the expansion of our secure third party conversion capabilities in response to the industry s long term favorable demand trend 
opportunities to expand our existing production and conversion capacities will continue to be accomplished through internal expansion and long term third party arrangements  as well as potential joint ventures and acquisitions 
titanium industry 
we develop certain industry estimates based on our extensive experience within the titanium industry as well as information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
we estimate that we accounted for approximately of and of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products and approximately of and of worldwide titanium sponge production 
the following chart illustrates our estimates of aggregate industry mill product shipments over the past ten years mill product shipments by industry sector volumes exclude shipments within china and russia the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium product producers 
over the past years  the titanium industry has had various cyclical peaks and troughs in mill product shipments 
since  titanium mill product demand in the military  industrial and emerging market sectors has increased  primarily due to the continued development of innovative uses for titanium products in these other industries 
over the last several years we  and the industry as a whole  have experienced significantly increased demand 
we estimate that industry shipments approximated  metric tons in and  metric tons in  with each year setting a new industry shipment record  and we currently expect total industry mill product shipments to increase by approximately to as compared to the estimated growth in demand for titanium products within the commercial aerospace sector is derived from both jet engine components eg  blades  discs  rings and engine cases and airframe components eg  bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  and our business cycle generally correlates to this timeline  although the actual timeline can vary considerably depending on the titanium product 
we estimate that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will increase to from our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
we shipped approximately of our mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in  whereas we estimate approximately of the overall titanium industry s mill products were shipped to the commercial aerospace sector in levels 
the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  traditionally issues worldwide forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july  approximately one third of which is expected to be required by the us over the next years 
the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january estimates deliveries of large commercial aircraft aircraft with over seats totaled including twin aisle aircraft in  and the following table summarizes the forecasted deliveries of large commercial aircraft over the next five years forecasted deliveries increase decrease over previous year year total twin aisle total twin aisle the latest forecast from the airline monitor reflects a increase in forecasted deliveries over the next five years compared to the july forecast over the next five years  in large part due to the record level of new orders placed for boeing and airbus models over the past three years 
total order bookings for boeing and airbus in were  planes  a significant increase over the record bookings in and higher than the bookings in the airline monitor forecasts aggregate new orders in will be lower than  but the strong bookings in through have increased the order backlog for both boeing and airbus  which will be delivered over the next several years 
changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
the latest forecast from the airline monitor estimates airbus firm order backlog at twin aisle planes and  single aisle planes and boeing s firm order backlog at  twin aisle planes and  single aisle planes 
although the airline monitor s latest forecast reflects a reduced near term delivery forecast for the boeing commercial aircraft  boeing has not yet quantified the overall impact of their recently announced delay 
twin aisle planes eg  boeing   and and airbus a  a  a and a tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than single aisle planes eg  boeing and and airbus a  a and a  and newer models tend to use a higher percentage of titanium than older models 
additionally  boeing generally uses a higher percentage of titanium in its airframes than airbus 
for example  based on information we receive from airframe and engine manufacturers and other industry sources  we estimate that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each boeing  and  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
based on these sources  we estimate that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each airbus a  a and a  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
at year end  a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a  a program officially launched in with its first delivery in late based on information we receive from airframe and engine manufacturers and other industry sources  we estimate that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each a manufactured 
additionally  at year end  a total of firm orders have been placed for the boeing  a program officially launched in april with anticipated first deliveries in although the will contain more composite materials than a typical boeing aircraft  based on these sources  we estimate that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each manufactured 
we believe significant additional titanium will be required in the early years of manufacturing until the program reaches maturity 
additionally  during  airbus officially launched the a xwb program  which is a major derivative of the airbus a  with first deliveries scheduled for as of december   a total of firm orders had been placed for the a xwb 
these a xwbs will use composite materials and new engines similar to those used on the boeing and are expected to require significantly more titanium as compared with earlier airbus models 
based on these sources  our preliminary estimates are that at least metric tons metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each a xwb manufactured 
however  the final titanium buy weight may change as the a xwb is still in the design phase 
titanium shipments into the military sector are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s after the end of the cold war 
in recent years  titanium has become an accepted use in ground combat vehicles as well as in naval vessels 
the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to continue to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities and global conflicts and to replace aging conventional armaments 
defense spending for most systems is expected to remain strong until at least current and anticipated future military strategy leading to light armament and mobility favor the use of titanium due to light weight and improved ballistic performance 
as the strategic environment demands a greater need for global lift and mobility  the us military needs more airlift capacity and capability 
airframe programs are expected to drive the military market demand for titanium through several of today s active us military programs  including the c and f  are currently expected to continue in production through the end of the current decade  while other programs  such as the f a and f  are expected to continue into the middle of the next decade 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
production levels for the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage are all forecasted to remain steady through the end of the decade 
in addition to the established programs  newer us programs offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f a raptor was given full rate production approval in april additionally  the f joint strike fighter  now known as the lightning ii  is expected to enter low rate initial production in late  with delivery of the first production aircraft in although no specific delivery patterns have been established  according to the teal group  a leading aerospace publication  procurement is expected to extend over the next to years and may include as many as approximately  planes  including sales to foreign nations 
utilization of titanium on military ground combat vehicles for armor appliqu and integrated armor or structural components continues to gain acceptance within the military market segment 
titanium armor components provide the necessary ballistic performance while achieving a mission critical vehicle performance objective of reduced weight in new generation vehicles 
in order to counteract increased threat levels globally  titanium is being utilized on vehicle upgrade programs in addition to new builds 
based on active programs  as well as programs currently under evaluation  we believe there will be additional usage of titanium on ground combat vehicles that will provide continued growth in the military market sector 
in armor and armament  we sell plate and sheet products for fabrication into appliqu plate and reactive armor for protection of the entire ground combat vehicle as well as the vehicle s primary structure 
the number of end use markets for titanium has continued to expand significantly 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
rapid growth of the chinese and other southeast asian economies has brought unprecedented demand for titanium intensive industrial equipment 
in november  we entered into a joint venture with xi an baotimet valinox tubes co 
ltd 
baotimet to produce welded titanium tubing in the peoples republic of china 
baotimet s production facilities are located in xi an  china  and production began in january titanium continues to gain acceptance in many emerging market applications  including transportation  energy including oil and gas and architecture 
although titanium is often more expensive than other competing metals  over the entire life cycle of the application  we believe that titanium is a less expensive alternative due to its durability  longevity and overall environmental impact 
in many cases customers also find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  design alternatives and other factors 
the oil and gas market  a relatively new and potentially large growth area  utilizes titanium for down hole casing  critical riser components  tapered stress joints  fire water systems and saltwater cooling systems 
additionally  as offshore development of new oil and gas fields moves into the ultra deep water depths and as geothermal energy production expands  market demand for titanium s light weight  high strength and corrosion resistance properties is creating new opportunities for the material 
we have focused additional resources on development of alloys and production processes to promote the expansion of titanium use in this market and in other non aerospace applications 
although we estimate that emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  we believe emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at double digit rates over the next several years 
we have ongoing initiatives to actively pursue and expand our presence in these markets 
products and operations 
we are a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in titanium products  ii melted products ingot  electrodes and slab  the result of melting titanium sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various alloys  iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe  and iv fabrications spools  pipe fittings  manifolds  vessels  etc 
that are cut  formed  welded and assembled from titanium mill products 
during the past three years  all of our net sales were generated by our integrated titanium operations our titanium melted and mill products segment  which is our only business segment 
business and geographic financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal with a porous and sponge like appearance 
the first step in our sponge production involves the combination of titanium containing rutile ores derived from beach sand with chlorine and petroleum coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
our titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada uses vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in a chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the sponge mass is mechanically pushed out of the distillation vessel  sheared and crushed 
the residual magnesium chloride  a by product of the vdp process  is electrolytically separated and recycled 
melted products ingot  electrodes and slab are produced by melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with alloys  to produce various grades of titanium products suited for the ultimate application of the product 
by introducing other alloys such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium  the melted titanium product is engineered to produce quality grades with varying combinations of certain physical attributes such as strength to weight ratio  corrosion resistance and milling compatibility 
titanium ingot is a cylindrical solid shape that  in our case  weighs up to metric tons 
titanium slab is a rectangular solid shape that  in our case  weighs up to metric tons 
the melting process for ingot and slab is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  we use our ingot and slab as the intermediate material for further processing into mill products 
however  we also sell ingot  electrodes and slab to third parties 
mill products are forged or rolled from our melted products ingot or slab 
mill products include long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe 
our mill products can be further machined to meet customer specifications with respect to size and finish using specified grades of material 
we send certain products to outside vendors for further processing eg  certain rolling  forging  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting and forging steps in france before being shipped to customers 
in france  our primary processor is also a partner in our owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa during  we entered into a year conversion services agreement with haynes international  inc  whereby haynes will provide an annual output capacity of  metric tons of titanium mill rolling services at their facility in kokomo  indiana until  with our option to increase the output capacity to  metric tons 
additionally  during  we entered into a long term agreement with carpenter technologies  inc  whereby carpenter is providing us dedicated annual forging capacity of  metric tons beginning in and increasing to  metric tons for through at least these agreements provide us with long term secure sources for processing round and flat products  resulting in a significant increase in our existing mill product conversion capabilities  which allows us to assure our customers of our long term ability to meet their needs 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  we perform extensive testing on our products 
sonic inspection as well as chemical and mechanical testing procedures are critical to ensuring that our products meet our customers high quality requirements  particularly in aerospace component production 
we certify that our products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
scrap by product from our mill production processes is typically recycled and introduced into the melting process once the scrap is sorted and cleaned 
distribution 
we sell our products through our own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
we also own eight service centers five in the us and three in europe  which we use to sell our products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products  including bar  sheet  plate  tubing and strip 
we believe our service centers provide a competitive advantage because of our ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium ingot  slab and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloys 
the following table summarizes our raw material usage requirements in the production of our melted and mill products percentage of total raw material requirements internally produced sponge purchased sponge titanium scrap alloys total the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa and sri lanka 
we purchase the majority of our supply of rutile ore from australia 
we believe the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and do not anticipate any interruptions of our rutile supplies 
we currently obtain chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson 
while we do not anticipate any chlorine supply problems  we have taken steps to mitigate this risk in the event of supply disruption  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable us to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow us to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge 
in  we completed an expansion of our existing premium grade titanium sponge facility at our henderson plant 
this expansion increased our annual productive sponge capacity to approximately  metric tons  an increase of approximately over the previous productive sponge capacity levels 
during and  other sponge producers also increased capacity and began construction on additional capacity expansion projects 
however  we do not know the degree to which quality and cost of the sponge produced by our competitors will be comparable to the premium grade sponge we produce in our henderson facility 
because we cannot supply all of our needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally  we continue to purchase a portion of our raw material requirements from third parties 
during  we entered into new long term sponge supply agreements that require us to make minimum annual purchases  including agreements with toho titanium co  ltd 
and ardor uk ltd 
together with its ust kamenogorsk titanium plant in kazakhstan  collectively referred to as ust 
in connection with our titanium sponge supply agreement with ust  we are also providing toll melting conversion services to ust 
these long term supply agreements  together with our current sponge production capacity in henderson  provide us with a total annual available sponge supply at levels ranging from  metric tons up to  metric tons through these third party agreements  in part  allowed us to indefinitely delay construction of an additional premium grade titanium sponge facility 
titanium melted and mill products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
we will continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources in  including those sources under existing supply agreements  and we will continue to evaluate sources of sponge supply 
the titanium scrap we utilize for melted products is internally generated from our melted and mill product production processes  purchased from certain of our customers under contractual agreements or acquired in the open metals market 
such scrap consists of alloyed and commercially pure solids and turnings 
scrap obtained through customer arrangements provides a closed loop arrangement resulting in certainty of supply and cost stability 
externally purchased scrap comes from a wide range of sources  including customers  collectors  processors and brokers 
due to our successful efforts to increase the volume of scrap obtained through closed loop arrangements  we only purchased to of our scrap requirement from external suppliers in we expect our scrap purchases to remain at the same rate during  despite the large increase in our scrap consumption during as our electron beam cold hearth eb melting activity increased 
we also occasionally sell scrap  usually in a form or grade we cannot economically use in our production operations 
overall market forces can significantly impact the supply or cost of externally produced scrap  as the amount of scrap generated in the supply chain varies during the titanium business cycles 
early in the titanium cycle  the demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to increase the scrap requirements for titanium manufacturers which precedes the increase in scrap generation by downstream customers and the supply chain 
the pressure on scrap generation and the supply chain places upward pressure on the market price of scrap 
the opposite situation occurs when demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to decline  resulting in greater availability of supply and downward pressure on the market price of scrap 
during the middle of the cycle  scrap generation and consumption are in relative equilibrium  minimizing disruptions in supply or significant changes in the available supply and market prices for scrap 
increasing or decreasing cycles tend to cause significant changes in both the supply and market price of scrap 
these supply chain dynamics result in selling prices for melted and mill products which tend to correspond with the changes in raw material costs 
all of our major competitors also utilize scrap as a raw material in their melt operations 
in addition to use by titanium manufacturers  titanium scrap is used in steel making operations during production of interstitial free steels  stainless steels and high strength low alloy steels 
prices for all forms and grades of titanium scrap declined steadily during  both for scrap used by titanium manufacturers and steel makers 
although demand from both sectors was strong during  a combination of increased scrap generation by the titanium supply chain and increased sponge supply helped reduce scrap prices to levels experienced prior to various alloys used in the production of titanium products are also available from a number of suppliers 
the recent high level of global demand for steel products has also resulted in a significant increase in the costs for several alloys  such as vanadium and molybdenum 
in  the costs of these alloys remained above historical levels of the past years but were below the cost peaks we experienced in the spring of although availability is not expected to be a concern and we have negotiated certain price and cost protection with suppliers and customers  alloy costs may continue to fluctuate in the future 
customer agreements 
we have long term agreements ltas with certain major customers  including  among others  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc and its german and us affiliates rolls royce  united technologies corporation utc  pratt whitney and related companies  soci t nationale d etude et de construction de moteurs d aviation snecma  wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc and valtimet sas 
these agreements expire at various times through  are subject to certain conditions and generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments  ii formula determined prices including some elements based on market pricing and iii price adjustments for certain raw material  labor and energy cost fluctuations 
generally  the ltas require our service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
certain provisions of these ltas have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
our sales revenues to customers under ltas were of our total sales revenues 
in certain events of nonperformance by us or the customer  the ltas may be terminated early 
although it is possible that some portion of the business would continue on a non lta basis  the termination of one or more of the ltas could result in a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the ltas were designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer  while providing us with a committed volume base throughout the titanium industry business cycles and certain mechanisms to adjust pricing for changes in certain cost elements 
markets and customer base 
the following table summarizes our sales revenue by geographical location year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to customers within north america europe other total further information regarding our external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets can be found in our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of our sales and operating income are derived from operations based in the us  the us  france and italy 
more than half of our sales revenue is from sales to the commercial aerospace sector 
we have ltas with several major aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  utc  snecma and wyman gordon 
this concentration of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit and other risks  either positively or negatively  in that all of these customers may be similarly affected by the same economic or other conditions 
the following table provides supplemental sales revenue information year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue ten largest customers significant customers pcc and pcc related entities boeing customers under ltas significant customers under ltas rolls royce boeing pcc and pcc related entities serve as suppliers to rolls royce

the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace sector consists of two major manufacturers of large commercial airframes  boeing commercial airplanes group a unit of boeing and airbus  as well as manufacturers of large civil aircraft engines including rolls royce  general electric aircraft engines  pratt whitney and snecma 
we sell directly to these major manufacturers  as well as to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use our titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
approximately of our sales revenue in both and and of sales revenue in was generated by sales into the commercial aerospace sector 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on our business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
the market for titanium in the military sector includes sales of melted and mill titanium products engineered for applications for military aircraft both engines and airframes  armor and component parts  armor appliqu on ground combat vehicles and other integrated armor or structural components 
we sell directly to many of the major manufacturers associated with military programs on a global basis 
approximately in  in and in of our sales revenue was generated by sales into the military sector 
outside of commercial aerospace and military sectors  we manufacture a wide range of products for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  automotive and power generation sectors 
approximately in  in and in of our sales revenue was generated by sales into industrial and emerging market sectors 
in addition to melted and mill products  which are sold into all market sectors  we sell certain other products such as titanium fabrications  titanium scrap and titanium tetrachloride 
sales of these other products represented of our sales revenue in  in and in our backlog has grown significantly from approximately billion at december   to billion at december  and to billion at december  over of the year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during our order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
we have explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
we will also continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
additionally  producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified to process titanium products 
there are also several producers of titanium sponge in the world  at least four of which are currently in some stage of increasing sponge production capacity 
we believe entry as a new producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment  substantial technical expertise and significant lead time 
our principal competitors in the aerospace titanium market are allegheny technologies incorporated ati and rti international metals  inc rti  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
uniti a joint venture between ati and vsmpo  rti and certain japanese producers are our principal competitors in the industrial and emerging markets 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of foreign participants has become a significant competitive factor 
prior to  imports of foreign titanium products into the us were not significant  primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent we are able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing sponge from such countries for use in our own operations  the negative effect of these imports on us can be somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
because a significant portion of end use products made from titanium products are ultimately exported  we  along with our principal competitors and many customers  actively utilize the duty drawback mechanism to recover most of the tariff paid on imports 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future 
the japanese government has raised the elimination or harmonization of tariffs on titanium products  including titanium sponge  for consideration in multi lateral trade negotiations through the world trade organization the so called doha round 
as part of the doha round  the united states has proposed the staged elimination of all industrial tariffs  including those on titanium 
the japanese government has specifically asked that titanium in all its forms be included in the tariff elimination program 
we have urged that no change be made to these tariffs  either on wrought or unwrought products 
the negotiations are ongoing and are expected to continue during we will continue to resist efforts to eliminate duties on titanium products  although we may not be successful in these activities 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge  ingot and mill products and thus our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in  legislation formerly known as the berry amendment  was re enacted by congress with minor changes 
in general  the berry amendment requires that the united states department of defense dod expend funds for products containing specialty metals  including titanium  that have been melted only in the united states 
in  the dod adopted regulations implementing the revised law which reduced the effectiveness of the law 
during  progress was achieved to move toward a successful implementation of the revised specialty metals provision and legislation was enacted into law in early which is expected to solidify the effectiveness of the law 
a weakening in the enforcement of the specialty metals clause could increase foreign competition for sales of titanium for defense products  adversely affecting our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
research and development 
our research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of our products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development for emerging markets 
in addition  we continue to work in partnership with the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa and others to explore means to reduce the cost of titanium production 
the work with darpa complements our research  development and exploration of innovative technologies and improvements to the existing processes such as vacuum distillation of sponge and vacuum arc remelting processes 
we conduct the majority of our research and development activities at our henderson technical laboratory in henderson  with additional activities at our witton  england facility 
we incurred research and development costs of million in  million in and million in patents and trademarks 
we hold us and us patents applicable to certain of our titanium alloys and manufacturing technology  which expire at various times from through and we have certain other patent applications pending 
we continually seek patent protection with respect to our technical base and have occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
we believe the trademarks timet and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are important to our business 
however  the majority of our titanium alloys and manufacturing technologies do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
employees 
our employee headcount varies due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and its impact on our business 
our employee headcount includes both our full and part time employees 
the increases in our headcount during and reflect the increase in demand for titanium products during those periods 
the following table shows our approximate employee headcount at the end of the past years employees at december  us europe total our production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio  and our production and maintenance workers in henderson approximately half of our total us employees are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in july and january  respectively 
employees at our other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a majority of the salaried and hourly employees at our european facilities are represented by various european labor unions

item a risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with our business 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor that could result in reduced earnings  liquidity or operating losses  could in turn adversely affect our ability to meet our liabilities or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry  which represents a significant portion of our business  creates uncertainty regarding our future profitability 
in addition  adverse changes to  or interruptions in  our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers could reduce our revenues 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers 
our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
we shipped approximately of our mill products to commercial aerospace customers in  whereas we estimate approximately of the overall titanium industry s mill products were shipped to commercial aerospace customers in the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium product producers 
our product sales  including melted and mill products  to commercial aerospace customers accounted for of our net sales for each of and and for in events that could adversely affect the commercial aerospace sector  such as future terrorist attacks  world health crises or unforeseen reductions in orders from commercial airlines  could significantly decrease our results of operations and financial condition 
sales under ltas with certain customers in the commercial aerospace sector account for a significant percentage of our annual sales revenue 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  snecma  utc and wyman gordon  under the ltas we have with these customers  our sales could decrease substantially 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
the global titanium markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the industries in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
in addition  producers of metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities 
such facilities could be used or modified to process titanium mill products  which could lead to increased competition and decreased pricing for our titanium products 
in addition  many factors  including the historical presence of excess capacity in the titanium industry  work to intensify the price competition for available business at low points in the business cycle 
our dependence upon certain critical raw materials that are subject to price and availability fluctuations could lead to increased costs or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers around the world  and principally on those located in australia  for our supply of titanium containing rutile ore  one of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge 
while chlorine  another of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge  is generally widely available  we currently obtain our chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson 
also  we cannot supply all our needs for all grades of titanium sponge and scrap internally and are therefore dependent on third parties for a substantial portion of our raw material requirements 
all of our major competitors utilize sponge and scrap as raw materials in their melt operations 
titanium scrap is also used in certain steel making operations  and demand for these steel products  especially from china  has produced a significant increase in demand for titanium scrap 
purchase prices and availability of these critical materials are subject to volatility 
at any given time  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical materials on a timely basis  on price and other terms acceptable to us  or at all 
to help stabilize our supply of titanium sponge  we have entered into ltas with certain sponge suppliers that contain fixed annual supply obligations 
these ltas also contain minimum annual purchase requirements 
see business products and operations raw materials  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements 
although inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate  during the same period certain critical raw material costs including titanium sponge and scrap have been volatile 
while we are able to mitigate some of the adverse impact of fluctuating raw material costs through ltas with suppliers and customers  rapid increases in raw material costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
the rapid increase in titanium prices may cause our customers to look for alternatives to titanium in their products 
our average selling prices for melted and mill titanium have on average increased and  respectively  in each of the last two years as a result of a sharp increase in titanium demand that has exceeded industry expansion 
if prices for titanium are sustained at this record level  new markets and application opportunities for titanium may diminish as the use of titanium becomes too costly for many manufacturers 
in addition  manufacturers that currently use titanium for their products may look for less expensive alternatives for titanium in existing products and applications 
if these events were to occur  our sales and operating results could decrease substantially  resulting in decreased profitability and our continued dependence on the military and commercial aerospace industries 
we change prices on certain of our products from time to time 
our ability to implement price increases is dependent on market conditions  economic factors  raw material costs and availability  competitive factors  operating costs and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the benefits of any price increases may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts 
these factors have had  and may have  an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
our failure to develop new markets would result in our continued dependence on the cyclical commercial aerospace sector  and our operating results would  accordingly  remain cyclical 
in an effort to reduce dependence on the commercial aerospace market and to increase participation in other markets  we have devoted certain resources to developing new markets and applications for our products 
developing these emerging market applications involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to the fact that titanium must compete with less expensive alternative materials in these potential markets or applications 
we may not be successful in developing new markets or applications for our products  significant time may be required for such development and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
because we are subject to environmental and worker safety laws and regulations  we may be required to remediate the environmental effects of our operations or take steps to modify our operations to comply with these laws and regulations  which could reduce our profitability 
various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations govern our operations 
throughout the history of our operations  we have used and manufactured  and currently use and manufacture  substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
although we have substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of environmental  health and safety issues  we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
some or all of these risks may result in liabilities that could reduce our profitability 
reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all tariffs on imported titanium products into the united states could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could decrease pricing for our products 
in the us titanium market  the increasing presence of foreign participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future  and we may not be successful in resisting efforts to eliminate duties or tariffs on titanium products 
see discussion of doha round in business competition 
we may be unable to reach or maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements with unions representing a significant portion of our employees 
our production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  and our production and maintenance workers in henderson  are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in july and january  for the respective locations 
a majority of the salaried and hourly employees at our european facilities are represented by various european labor unions 
each of our labor agreements with our uk employees expires in  and the agreements with our french and italian employees are renewed annually 
a labor dispute or work stoppage could materially decrease our operating results 
we may not succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions to replace expiring agreements or to maintain satisfactory relations under existing collective bargaining agreements 
if our employees were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs

practical capacities are variable based on product mix and are not additive 
these capacities are as ofdecember  and do not reflect the increases expected to be realized during as a result of capacity expansion projects  several of which are mentioned below 
practical capacities are based on the approximate maximum equivalent product that cezus is contractuallyobligated to provide 
during the past three years  our major production facilities have operated at varying levels of practical capacity 
overall our plants operated at approximately of practical capacity in and and in in  our plants are expected to operate at approximately of practical capacity 
however  practical capacity and utilization measures can vary significantly based upon the mix of products produced 
united states production 
in  we completed the expansion of our existing premium grade titanium sponge facility in henderson and reached practical capacity for commercial production in early this expansion increases our annual productive capacity to approximately  metric tons  an increase of approximately over the previous productive sponge capacity levels 
our us melting facilities in henderson  morgantown and vallejo produce ingot and slab  which are either used as feedstock for our mill products operations or sold to third parties  and we are in the process of expanding our melt capacity 
our melting facilities are expected to operate at approximately of annual practical capacity in  which is consistent with our capacity utilization in melt capacities will increase throughout as we complete and ramp up certain expansion projects 
in early  we completed an  metric ton expansion of our eb melt capacity in morgantown 
in addition  we have commenced efforts to add another eb furnace at the same facility  which is currently on schedule to be completed in the last half of we also commenced an addition to our var capacity in morgantown during  which is expected to be completed by mid upon completion  these melt capacity additions will increase our eb melt capacity by approximately and our var capacity by approximately 
our raw materials processing facility in morgantown primarily processes scrap used as melting feedstock  either in combination with sponge or separately 
we produce titanium mill products in the us at our forging and rolling facility in toronto  which receives ingot or slab principally from our us melting facilities 
our us forging and rolling facility is expected to operate at approximately of annual practical capacity in  up from in capacity utilization across our individual mill product lines varies 
under various conversion services agreements with third party vendors  we have access to a dedicated annual capacity at certain of our vendors facilities 
our access to outside conversion services includes dedicated annual rolling capacity of at least  metric tons until  with the option to increase the output capacity to  metric tons 
additionally  we have access to dedicated annual forging capacity of  metric tons beginning in and ramping up to  metric tons for through at least these agreements provide us with a long term secure source for processing round and flat products  resulting in a significant increase in our existing mill product conversion capabilities  which allows us to assure our customers of our long term ability to meet their needs

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary general overview 
we are a vertically integrated producer of titanium sponge  melted products and a variety of mill products for commercial aerospace  military  industrial and other applications 
we are one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted products ingot  electrodes and slab and mill products billet  bar  plate  sheet and strip 
we are the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
we are currently the largest producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  in the united states 
we sell our titanium melted and mill products into four worldwide market sectors 
aggregate shipment volumes for titanium mill products in were derived from the following sectors timet titanium industry mill product shipments of total mill product shipments of total metric tons metric tons commercial aerospace military industrial emerging markets estimates based on our titanium industry experience and information obtained from publicly availableexternal resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
the titanium industry derives a substantial portion of its demand from the highly cyclical commercial aerospace sector 
as shown in the table above  our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  asset lives  impairments of investments  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors we believe to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
we consider the policies and estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires our most significant judgments in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
inventory valuation 
we provide reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for our products  alternate uses of the inventory and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  we may be required to recognize additional inventories reserves 
impairment of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  may not be recoverable  we undertake an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance if realization of our gross deferred income tax assets is not more likely than not after giving consideration to recent historical results and near term projections  and we also consider the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or amount of  any valuation allowance 
we record reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
see results of operations income taxes for discussion of our analysis of our deferred income tax valuation allowances and note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
pension and opeb expenses and obligations 
our pension and opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
we review these rates annually with the assistance of our actuaries 
see further discussion of the factors considered and potential effect of these estimates in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
results of operations comparison of to summarized financial information 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and our reported average selling prices are a reflection of actual selling prices after the effects of currency exchange rates  customer and product mix and other related factors throughout the periods presented 
for the year ended december  of total net sales of total net sales in millions  except product shipment data net sales melted products mill products other titanium products total net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  administrative and development expense other income expense  net operating income melted product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram mill product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram net sales 
during  net sales increased to  million 
overall industry fundamentals and outlook continue to support a long term favorable trend in demand for titanium across all major market sectors 
average selling prices for melted and mill products increased and  respectively  in compared to we expect the current trend in customer demands to continue to influence a shift of our product mix toward an increased proportion of mill products  which require additional processing and resources and also command higher sales prices as compared to melted products 
while our combined melted and mill product shipment volume declined during  our mill product shipment volume increased slightly in compared to the prior year 
the long term demand outlook for our products continues to be favorable despite the near term effects of certain commercial aircraft production delays and other adjustments to build out schedules  fluctuations in customer inventory levels and product mix 
the increased pricing on our products and the favorable shift in product mix more than offset the effects of lower aggregate sales volume for compared to cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased million  or  in as compared to due to an increase in certain raw material costs  including titanium sponge and scrap  and higher production costs associated with our shift in product mix to a greater percentage of mill products 
the higher cost of sponge in is partially due to our final utilization in the first half of of lower cost sponge previously purchased from the us defense logistics agency dla stockpile and the rapid rise in titanium sponge and scrap market prices experienced through the first half of over the past year  increases in global titanium sponge capacity and increased use of titanium in the manufacture of components and products have resulted in the increased availability of titanium sponge and scrap 
as a result  our cost of purchased titanium sponge and scrap has been declining during the latter part of  and we anticipate this trend will continue into these declining raw material costs will also  in certain cases  result in indexed adjustments to selling prices under our long term sales agreements 
despite these recent trends in titanium sponge and scrap costs  the majority of the products sold during include higher cost raw materials acquired during prior periods due to the elapsed time required to convert these raw materials into their final form and to deliver them to our customers 
gross margin 
during  our gross margin increased to million as compared to our gross margin percentage decreased from in to in cost of sales increases associated with our higher raw material costs and higher cost of production  as discussed above  were partially offset by the increases in average selling prices 
operating income 
our operating income for was million compared to million in the same period in the period includes a million expense related to previously capitalized costs associated with the planning and engineering for a new vdp sponge plant due to our decision to delay the project indefinitely 
the period was positively impacted by million of equity in earnings related to our interest in the valtimet joint venture that we sold in december  partially offset by million of travel  relocation and severance expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of our headquarters to dallas  texas and our operational management and information technology group to exton  pennsylvania 
net other non operating income and expense 
during  we recognized other non operating income of million compared to other non operating income of million during as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we realized an million gain on the sale of our investment in compx during  and we realized a million gain on the sale of our investment in valtimet during income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and  as a result  the geographic mix of our pre tax income or loss can impact our overall effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate for was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a change in the mix of our pre tax earnings  with a higher percentage of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions in primarily as a result of the implementation of an internal corporate reorganization in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  an income tax benefit of million related primarily to the reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of our interest in compx  and an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of our interest in valtimet  an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of  and an income tax benefit of million related to the elimination of certain items included in other comprehensive income following the sale of our interest in valtimet 
comparison of to summarized financial information 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and our reported average selling prices are a reflection of actual selling prices after the effects of currency exchange rates  customer and product mix  and other related factors throughout the periods presented 
for the year ended december  of total net sales of total net sales in millions  except product shipment data net sales melted products mill products other titanium products total net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  administrative and development expense other operating income and expenses  net operating income melted product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram mill product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram net sales 
we experienced significant sales growth during  as net sales increased  or million  compared to we  and the industry as a whole  benefited significantly from strong demand for titanium across all major industry market sectors that drove melted and mill titanium prices to record levels 
in addition  during we had a higher mix of sales to customers under ltas whose terms contained pricing provisions that limited our ability to immediately adjust selling prices in response to increased production costs  particularly raw materials  or other market changes 
as certain of those ltas expired  or as prices were adjusted as permitted under the ltas  continued sales to these customers in were at pricing terms that more closely reflected market pricing 
as a result of these factors  average selling prices for melted and mill products increased and  respectively  compared to in addition to the improved pricing  we delivered more melted products and more mill products compared to further  other product sales increased compared to due principally to improved demand for our fabrication products related primarily to increased construction of chemical  power and other industrial facilities 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased million  or  in compared to due to increased sales volumes and higher average cost of raw materials  including purchased titanium sponge and titanium scrap 
the higher cost of our purchased sponge was due principally to our utilization in of lower cost sponge purchased from the dla stockpile 
we purchased sponge from the dla stockpile since  but the stockpile became fully depleted in the higher cost of our purchased titanium scrap was due to increased industry wide demand as well as demand in non titanium markets that use titanium as an alloying agent 
the impact of market increases in the cost of sponge and scrap was mitigated  in part  because certain of our raw material purchases were subject to long term agreements 
in addition to the impact of higher raw material costs  our cost of sales increased as our energy costs increased and as we increased our manufacturing employee headcount by approximately full time equivalents compared to in order to support the continued growth of our business 
our cost of sales was favorably impacted by our increased production levels  as our overall plant operating rates improved to in compared to the prior year plant operating rate of 
despite these overall increases  cost of sales was reduced to of sales for compared to for  as increases in selling prices more than offset the higher costs 
gross margin 
during  our gross margin increased to million compared to our gross margin percentage increased from in to in our improved profitability was generally driven by the increase in sales prices for our products and improved plant operating rates  which more than offset the effect of our higher raw material and energy costs 
operating income 
our operating income for increased to million compared to  and our operating income percentage increased from in to in the increase in operating income was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin which is somewhat offset by increases in selling  general  administrative and development sga d expense and a decrease in other operating income 
during  our sga d expense increased million to million compared to primarily due to i million of travel  relocation and severance expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of our headquarters to dallas  texas and our operational management and information technology group to exton  pennsylvania  ii increased employee compensation as a result of additional personnel to support expansion of our business and iii increased audit and consulting fees associated with the expansion of our business 
sga d expense decreased from of sales in to of sales in due to the significant sales growth 
our other operating income for decreased million from million in to million in  primarily related to our lta with boeing 
during  we recorded million of other operating income related to the take or pay provisions which were part of our previous lta with boeing 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in under our current lta with boeing  the take or pay provisions under the previous lta were replaced with an annual makeup payment early in the following year in the event boeing purchases less than its annual commitment in any year 
based on the provisions of the new lta  no makeup payment was required for other operating income in also includes million related to our settlement of a customer claim regarding prior order cancellations 
somewhat offsetting these decreases was our equity in earnings of valtimet  which increased million to million in due to their higher earnings resulting from stronger demand and increased pricing in the industrial welded tubing market 
net other non operating income and expense 
during  we recognized other non operating income of million compared to other non operating income of million during as discussed previously  we realized a million gain on the sale of our investment in valtimet during net other non operating income during included a gain on the sale of certain real property of million 
additionally  during  the us dollar weakened relative to the british pound sterling and the euro  which resulted in net currency transaction losses of million as compared to net currency transaction gains of million in as the us dollar strengthened relative to the british pound sterling and the euro 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and  as a result  the geographic mix of our pre tax income or loss can impact our overall effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate for was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a change in the mix of our pre tax earnings  with a higher percentage of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions in our effective income tax rate for was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to the us and the u 
k 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of our interest in valtimet  an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of  and an income tax benefit of million related to the elimination of certain items included in other comprehensive income following the sale of our interest in valtimet 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to the us and the uk  an income tax expense of million related to the elimination of an amount included in other comprehensive income related to our defined benefit pension plan in the us  and an income tax expense of million related to the repatriation of dividends from our european subsidiaries 
minority interest 
minority interest relates principally to our french subsidiary  timet savoie  which is owned by cezus 
minority interest increased million from  to million during  due to increased net income at timet savoie  whose results of operations were favorably impacted by increased sales prices for melted and mill products during dividends on series a preferred stock 
our series a preferred stock accrues a cumulative cash dividend of of the per share liquidation preference per year 
shares of our series a preferred stock are also convertible to shares of our common stock at any time by the shareholder 
during  million shares of our series a preferred stock were converted into million shares of our common stock  as compared to million shares of our series a preferred stock converted to million shares of common stock during based on the number of series a preferred shares outstanding throughout each year  cumulative dividends attributable to our series a preferred stock were million during  compared to million during european operations we have substantial operations located in the uk  france and italy 
approximately of our sales originated in europe for  of which approximately were denominated in the british pound sterling or the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for our european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  and the european subsidiaries are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of our european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
our export sales from the us are denominated in us dollars and are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not use currency contracts to hedge our currency exposures 
at december   consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of us dollar cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
outlook we achieved record levels of net sales in  reflecting strong demand for titanium metal across all major market sectors commercial aerospace  industrial  military and emerging markets 
these results were largely driven by higher average selling prices for both melted and mill products  as well as favorable changes in product mix 
our backlog remains strong at billion as of december  compared to billion at december  we continue to pursue our strategic plans that focus on anticipated long term favorable trends in demand by expanding our productive capacity with a focus on opportunities to improve our operating flexibility  efficiency and cost structure 
in particular  we continue to expand our operating capabilities in the demanding aerospace industry segment in order to enhance our ability to meet our current and prospective customers needs and strengthen our position as a reliable supplier in markets where technical ability and precision are critical 
these efforts include strategic initiatives to assure we have the necessary availability of raw materials  melt capacity and mill product processing capabilities 
while the recently announced delays of initial deliveries of the boeing dreamlinertm commercial aircraft may contribute to short term volatility in the overall market demand for our products as adjustments are made at various levels in the aircraft supply chain  we expect current industry wide demand trends will continue to be favorable 
with our current plant production levels near practical capacity  we have taken several actions to significantly expand our productive capacity across all areas of our manufacturing operations  including the following raw materials 
during  we entered into long term sponge supply agreements with three manufacturers that  together with our current sponge production capacity at our facility in henderson  provide us with a total annual available sponge supply at levels ranging from  metric tons up to  metric tons through the completion of the additional long term sponge supply agreements  together with reaching full productive capacity at our henderson sponge facility and initiatives to increase our scrap recycling and melt capabilities  provide timet with additional options and greater flexibility with regard to its future raw material supply requirements 
in addition  we continue to explore other opportunities to secure long term titanium sponge supply agreements and utilize sponge acquired from established suppliers to supplement the titanium scrap utilized for melted products that is internally generated at our production facilities  purchased from certain customers under contractual agreements or acquired in the open metals market 
in anticipation of a significant increase in the availability of titanium scrap and moderation in its cost relative to levels experienced during the past months  we are increasing our capacity to recycle scrap and use eb melt capacity to efficiently use a combination of sponge and scrap to produce melted titanium products 
our goal is to have assured and flexible availability of raw materials which affords us the ability to respond to industry demands in a timely and cost efficient manner 
we believe our projected mix of internally generated sponge and scrap  along with our assured long term third party sources of sponge and scrap  will assist in controlling cost for the products we produce compared to that which could be achieved solely through additional internal production of sponge 
melted products 
we are in the process of expanding our global melt capacity 
we recently completed an  metric ton expansion of our eb melt capacity in morgantown  and we have commenced construction of another eb furnace at the same facility  which is currently on schedule to be completed in the last half of during we also commenced construction of new var furnaces at our witton  morgantown and savoie locations  all of which are expected to be completed by mid these additions will more than double our eb melt capacity and will increase our var melt capacity by approximately one third 
as we continue to adjust our long term business plan in response to industry trends  we will consider more additions to our melt capacity based on our raw material sources and product mix 
we have also been able to leverage our melt capacity and expertise as integral components of certain arrangements for additional and alternative sources of raw materials and conversion services 
mill products and conversion services 
we have numerous capital projects in process to improve and expand our production capacity for mill products 
also  under various conversion services agreements with third party vendors  we have access to a dedicated annual capacity at certain of our vendors facilities 
our access to outside conversion services includes dedicated annual rolling capacity of at least  metric tons until  with the option to increase the output capacity to  metric tons 
additionally  we have access to dedicated annual forging capacity of  metric tons beginning in and increasing to  metric tons for through at least these agreements provide us with a long term secure source for processing round and flat products  resulting in a significant increase in our existing mill product conversion capabilities  which allows us to assure our customers of our long term ability to meet their needs 
customer agreements 
during and early  we completed renewals  extensions and  in certain cases  expansions of our long term supply agreements with several of our customers that supply components to the major aerospace jet engine manufacturers 
as a result  we have enhanced our position as the major supplier of titanium to the aerospace jet engine market  including long term supply agreements with terms up to years and aggregate estimated revenues of up to approximately billion 
based on existing customer agreements and relationships  we currently estimate that we will supply approximately two thirds of the global commercial aerospace jet engine market requirements for titanium 
we also have existing long term supply agreements with other commercial aerospace and industrial customers and continue to explore opportunities to expand or renew these existing arrangements  as well as to enter into new long term agreements in these and other industry segments 
general 
we intend to continue to explore other opportunities to expand our existing production and conversion capacities through internal expansion and long term third party arrangements  as well as potential joint ventures and acquisitions 
we believe our efforts to allocate resources across our entire manufacturing process  supplemented with committed capacity from third party sources  will allow us to achieve profitable growth and enhance long term return on invested capital 
we estimate that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will increase to  as compared to the latest forecast issued in january by the airline monitor reflects a increase in forecasted aircraft deliveries over the next five years compared to the july forecast  in large part due to the record level of new orders placed for boeing and airbus models during and a stronger than expected order rate in defense spending for most systems is expected to remain strong until at least current and future military strategy leading to light armament and mobility favor the use of titanium due to light weight and strong ballistic performance 
although we estimate that emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  we believe emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at double digit rates over the next several years 
overall industry outlook continues to support a long term favorable trend in demand for titanium across all major market sectors  including commercial aerospace  military  industrial and emerging markets 
commercial aerospace is the leading driver for the anticipated increase in demand  in large part due to the record level of new orders placed for boeing and airbus models during and a stronger than expected order rate in with approximately of our mill products sold for commercial aerospace applications  we are particularly impacted by demand trends in that market sector  and we anticipate that commercial aerospace demand will continue to favorably impact demand for our products for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources our consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating  investing and financing activities operating activities 
cash flow from operations is considered a primary source of our liquidity 
changes in pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities increased million  from million in to million in the net effects of the following significant items contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities lower operating income in of million  the million payment made to haynes in in return for the dedicated rolling capacity  lower net cash used by changes in receivables  inventories  payables and accrued liabilities of million in in response to changing working capital requirements  and higher net cash paid for income taxes in including our tax benefit related to stock option exercises which was million lower in of million due to the utilization of the remainder of our us net operating loss carryforward in and a overpayment which resulted in refundable income taxes of million 
our working capital requirements have changed significantly since as our net sales and sales volume have increased dramatically 
cash outflows to support our working capital requirements for were influenced by increasing unit cost for inventory as well as increased inventory purchases to support higher levels of sales volume 
in contrast  as sales volumes have decreased somewhat and purchased inventory costs per unit have declined during  the cash outflow to support our working capital requirements was not as significant during the compared to cash provided by operating activities increased million  from million in to million in the net effects of the following significant items contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities higher operating income of million in  the million payment made to haynes in in return for the dedicated rolling capacity  higher net cash used by changes in receivables  inventories  payables and accrued liabilities of million in  due primarily to higher accounts receivable and inventory levels resulting from the increased level of business activity  higher net cash paid for income taxes in including our million income tax benefit in related to the exercise of stock options of million due to the utilization of the remainder of our us net operating loss carryforward and higher taxable income in our foreign jurisdictions in  and higher aggregate contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in of million 
investing activities 
cash flows used in our investing activities changed from million in to million in to million in our capital expenditures were million during  compared to million during both and and included the following the amount includes expenditures related to construction on our now completed water conservation facility located in henderson as well as the expansion of our sponge plant 
the amount includes expenditures related to our sponge plant expansion in henderson  which became fully operational in  and our new eb furnace at our facility in morgantown  which became operational in early during  we had lower expenditures on the sponge capacity expansion project  as the expansion was completed in april however  we incurred a higher level of expenditures related to the eb melt capacity expansion project at our facility in morgantown and other capacity expansion projects initiated in which largely offset the expenditure reductions on the sponge plant expansion project 
million received in from the sale of our interest in valtimet 
financing activities 
we had net borrowings of million in under our us and us bank credit facilities which were used primarily to fund our working capital and capital expenditures 
we had net repayments of million in  funded primarily with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in valtimet 
we had no borrowing activity during other significant items included in our cash flows from financing activities included dividends paid on our common stock of million in  dividends paid to cezus of million in  million in and million in  dividends paid on our series a preferred stock of million in  million in and million in  proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon exercise of stock options of million in  million in and million in  and an income tax benefit of million in and million in related to the exercise of stock options 
future cash requirements liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under various credit facilities 
we generally use these amounts to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends including first quarter regular quarterly common stock dividends declared by our board of directors aggregating to million 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness  iii make investments in marketable and other securities including the acquisition of securities issued by our subsidiaries and affiliates or iv fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our alternative uses of capital  debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past  or in light of our current outlook  may in the future  seek to raise additional capital  modify our common and preferred dividend policies  restructure ownership interests  incur  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase shares of common stock  purchase or redeem series a preferred stock  sell assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the titanium  specialty metal and other industries 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
at december   we had aggregate borrowing availability under our existing u 
s and european credit facilities of million  and we had an aggregate of million of cash and cash equivalents 
our us credit facility matures in february  and our us credit facility matures in july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon our expectations of our operating performance  the anticipated demands on our cash resources  borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities and anticipated borrowing capacity after the maturity of these credit facilities  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the short term defined as the next twelve month period and our long term obligations  including our planned capacity expansion projects  some of which are discussed below 
if actual developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
capital expenditures 
we currently estimate we will invest a total of approximately million to million for capital expenditures during  primarily for improvements in and expansion of existing productive capacity 
we are currently expanding our melt capacity at our morgantown  witton and savoie locations in response to industry demand trends  and we expect to complete these additions during and we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to expand our productive capacity including capital projects  acquisitions or other investments which  if consummated  any required funding would be provided by borrowings under our us or european credit facilities 
contractual commitments 
as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we were a party to various agreements at december  that contractually commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including pricing  quantity and date of payment payment due date after total in millions operating leases purchase obligations raw materials other other contractual obligations these obligations generally relate to the purchase of titanium sponge pursuant to ltas that expire at varying dates as described in item business and various other open orders or commitments for purchase of raw materials 
certain of the ltas contain automatic renewal provisions  however  we have only included the purchase commitments associated with the initial terms of each lta 
these obligations generally relate to contractual purchase obligations for conversion services  certain operating fees paid to cezus for use of a portion of its ugine plant pursuant to an agreement expiring in as described in item properties  energy purchase obligations with bmi which expire in and various other open orders for purchase of energy  utilities and property and equipment 
these obligations are generally based on an average price and an assumed constant mix of products purchased  as appropriate 
all open orders are primarily for delivery in these other obligations are recorded on our balance sheet as of december  and consist of an obligation under a worker s compensation bond and capital and interest payments under capital lease agreements 
additionally  we have an obligation to contran under an intercorporate services agreement isa which will be recorded ratably over the service period 
we expect to enter into an isa annually with contran subsequent to the above table does not reflect any amounts that we might pay to fund our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future fundings are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and actual future retiree medical costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing agreements other than the outstanding letters of credit and operating leases discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   we maintain three defined benefit pension plans one each in the us  the us and france 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and uk plans  as the french plan is not material to our consolidated balance sheets  statements of income or statements of cash flows 
we recorded net consolidated pension expense of million in  million in and million in pension expense or income for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
the discount rate we utilize for determining pension expense or income and pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds to year maturities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies  composite indices provided by our actuaries and discount rates derived from our expected cash flows for each of our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans 
changes in our discount rate over the past three years reflect the fluctuations in such bond rates during that period 
we establish a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense or income for the subsequent year 
we used the following discount rate assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in us plan uk plan in developing our expected long term rate of return assumptions  we evaluate historical market rates of return and input from our actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
we used the following long term rate of return assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans long term rates of return used for pension expense for the year ended december us plan uk plan lowering the expected long term rate of return on our us plan s assets by from to would have decreased pension income by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased our us plan s pension income by approximately million 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased our uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
all of our us plan s assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt 
the cmrt is a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and related companies 
a sub account of the cmrt held of timet common stock at december   however  our plan assets are invested only in the portion of the cmrt that does not hold timet common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
mr 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the trustee of the cmrt  along with the cmrt s investment committee  of which mr 
simmons is a member  actively manage the investments of the cmrt 
the trustee and investment committee periodically change the asset mix of the cmrt based upon  among other things  advice from third party advisors and their respective expectations as to what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
at december   the cmrt s asset mix based on an aggregate asset value of million was us equity securities  foreign equity securities and fixed income and other securities 
during  and  the assumed long term rate of return for our us plan assets that invested in the cmrt was 
in determining the appropriateness of the long term rate of return assumption  we considered  among other things  the historical rates of return of the cmrt  the current and projected asset mix of the cmrt and the investment objectives of the cmrt s managers 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return earned by the cmrt  as calculated based on the average percentage change in the cmrt s net asset value per cmrt unit for each applicable year  has been with an return for 
for our uk plan  as a result of market fluctuations experienced and the strategic movement toward our long term funding and asset allocation strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and fixed income securities 
our future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our uk plan is based on our target asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities and all current contributions to the plan are invested wholly in fixed income securities in order to gradually affect the shift 
based on various factors  including economic and market conditions  gains on the plan assets during each of the preceding years and projected asset mix  our assumed long term rate of return for our pension expense was for  for and for because all contributions continue to be put into fixed income securities  we expect the asset mix for our uk plan to continue to move closer to the projected mix  which reflects a higher percentage of fixed income securities 
although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  we continue to evaluate our expected rate of return annually and adjust it as considered necessary 
actual returns on plan assets for a given year that are greater than the assumed rates of return result in an actuarial gain  while actual returns on plan assets for a given year that are less than the assumed rates of return result in an actuarial loss 
all of these actuarial gains and losses are not recognized in earnings currently  but instead are deferred and amortized into income in the future as part of pension expense 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative actuarial gains 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  we estimate that our us plan will have pension income of approximately million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase estimated pension income by approximately million in  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the long term rate of return would increase or decrease estimated pension income by approximately million in  respectively 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of  we estimate that pension expense for our uk plan will approximate million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
a increase in the long term rate of return would decrease estimated pension expense in by approximately million  and conversely  a decrease in the long term rate of return would increase estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
actual future pension expense will depend on actual future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans 
we made no cash contributions in  million in and million in to our us plan and cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to our uk plan 
the contribution to our uk plan included a million discretionary contribution 
based upon the current funded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  we believe that we will be required to make contributions of million to our uk plan and none to the uk plan 
the fair value of the plans assets has increased significantly over the past three years based mainly on performance of each plans equity securities 
the fair value of the assets of the us plan was million at december   million at december  and million at december   and the fair value of the assets of the uk plan was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the combination of actual investment returns  changing discount rates and changes in other assumptions has a significant effect on our funded plan status plan assets compared to projected benefit obligations 
the effect of positive investment returns and an increase in the discount rate increased the over funded status of the us plan from million at december  to million at december  and to million at december  in the effect of positive investment returns and an increase in the discount rate for our uk plan  more than offset the effect of the weakening dollar compared to the british pound sterling  thereby reducing the under funded status of the uk plan from million at december  to million at december  and to million at december  postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
we provide limited opeb benefits to a portion of our us employees upon retirement 
we fund such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
we paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  of million in  million in and million in we recorded consolidated opeb expense of million in  million in and million in opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
the discount rate we utilize for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is the same as that used for our us pension plan 
lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have had a nominal impact on our opeb expense 
we estimate the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by our actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  we consider industry trends  our actual healthcare cost experience and our future benefit structure 
for  we used a beginning health care trend rate of 
if the health care trend rate were increased or decreased by for each year  opeb expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million in  respectively 
for  we are using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  we estimate that opeb expense will approximate million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a nominal impact on estimated opeb expense in a increase or decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase or decrease the estimated service and interest cost components of opeb expense by approximately million in  respectively 
based upon the actuarial assumptions being used in  we believe we will be required to pay opeb benefits of million in  net of retiree contributions and a medicare part d federal subsidy 
environmental matters 
see business regulatory and environmental matters in item and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of environmental matters 
affiliate transactions 
corporations that may be deemed to be controlled by or affiliated with mr 
simmons sometimes engage in i intercorporate transactions such as guarantees  management and expense sharing arrangements  shared fee arrangements  joint ventures  partnerships  loans  options  advances of funds on open account  and sales  leases and exchanges of assets  including securities issued by both related and unrelated parties  and ii common investment and acquisition strategies  business combinations  reorganizations  recapitalizations  securities repurchases  and purchases and sales and other acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries  divisions or other business units  which transactions have involved both related and unrelated parties and have included transactions which resulted in the acquisition by one related party of a publicly held minority equity interest in another related party 
we continuously consider reviews and evaluate such transactions  and understand that contran  valhi and related entities consider  review and evaluate such transactions 
depending upon the business  tax and other objectives then relevant  it is possible that we might be a party to one or more such transactions in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain related party transactions that we were a party to during  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to indebtedness 
we typically do not enter into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage our interest rate market risk 
we had no outstanding bank indebtedness at december  and our borrowings accrue interest at variable rates  generally related to spreads over bank prime rates and libor 
because our bank indebtedness reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such debt is believed to approximate fair value 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
we do not enter into currency forward contracts to manage our foreign exchange market risk associated with receivables  payables or indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the particular entity 
see results of operations european operations in item md a for further discussion 
commodity prices 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices as a result of our long term purchase and supply agreements with certain suppliers and customers 
these agreements  which offer various fixed or formula determined pricing arrangements  effectively obligate us to bear i the risk of increased raw material and other costs to us that cannot be passed on to our customers through increased titanium product prices in whole or in part or ii the risk of decreasing raw material costs to our suppliers that are not passed on to us in the form of lower raw material prices 
however  our ability to offset increased material costs with higher selling prices increased in and  as many of our ltas have either expired or have been renegotiated with price adjustments that take into account raw material  labor and energy cost fluctuations 
securities prices 
as of december  and  we held certain marketable securities that are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the securities 
the aggregate market value of these equity securities was million at december  and million at december  the potential change in the aggregate market value of these securities  assuming a change in prices  would have been million at december  and nominal at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest bearing note receivable 
at december   we held a note receivable from compx in the principal amount of million 
our note receivable accrues interest at variable rates  related to the spread over libor 
because our note receivable reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such note receivable is believed to approximate fair value
