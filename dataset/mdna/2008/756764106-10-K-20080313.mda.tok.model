item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a nyse listed hospitality and leisure company ticker symbols rlh and rlh pa primarily engaged in the ownership  operation  development and franchising of midscale and upscale hotels 
established over years 
table of contents ago  the red lion brand is nationally recognized and particularly well known in the western united states where most of our hotels are located 
the red lion brand is typically associated with three and four star hotels by our customers 
as of december   our hotel system contained hotels located in eight states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space as provided below total meeting available space hotels rooms sq 
ft 
red lion owned and leased hotels other leased hotel managed hotel red lion franchised hotels total total red lion hotels leased hotels are those properties which we operate and manage and have ownership of some or all of the equipment and personal property on site  however  the hotel facility and the underlying land is subject to an operating lease from a third party 
our lease expiration dates range from to and have renewal provisions beyond that 
represents a hotel acquired in the fourth quarter of that is being repositioned as a red lion  and is currently being operated as an independent hotel 
subsequent to december   this hotel did not renew its agreement with red lion and has since left our system of hotels 
red lion is about staying comfortable and our product and service culture works in both large urban and smaller markets 
the character of our hotels strives to reflect our individual local markets while maintaining consistent brand standards  which we feel makes our hotels an attractive choice for customers within the markets we currently operate 
we believe our adherence to consistent customer service standards and brand touch points makes guests feel at home no matter where they are 
we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
the franchise and management segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brand to franchisees and managing hotels for third party owners 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs 
these programs include the reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
it also reflects revenue from management fees charged to the owners of our managed hotels  typically based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenues plus an incentive fee based on operating performance 
the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion and presentation of entertainment productions 
we have historically owned certain commercial real estate 
we also have engaged in traditional real estate related services  including developing  managing and acting as a broker for sales and leases of commercial and multi unit residential properties collectively referred to as the real estate management business 
together  these operations comprised our real estate segment 
effective april   we divested the real estate management business 
in addition  consistent with our strategy of divesting non core assets  during the fourth quarter of  we listed one of our two remaining wholly owned commercial real estate properties for sale and have classified its results of operations within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in september  we sold the 
table of contents property for approximately million and recognized a pre tax gain on sale of million 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our remaining activities  none of which constitutes a reportable segment  have been aggregated into other  including the remaining operations of our former real estate segment  which have been reclassified for all comparative periods  where appropriate 
results of operations for the year ended december   net income was million or per share  compared to a net loss of approximately million or per share in and net income of million or per share in a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is as follows total revenue operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense expense of early extinguishment of debt minority interest in partnerships  net other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss earnings loss per share basic and diluted ebitda ebitda from continuing operations net income during improved over the comparative periods  a direct result of an increase in hotel revenues during to million from million in and million in operating income increased to million during  primarily driven by profitability in the hotels segment due to strong gains in both rate and occupancy at our owned and leased hotels 
positive current year operating results were offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense over and from the completed hotel renovations 
included in results was a million gain from the sale of the real estate management business 
results for reflect the transition of the red lion hotel sacramento from a leased hotel to a franchise during july  reducing revenues compared to by million  partially offset by the addition of million in revenues from our anaheim property added during the fourth quarter of net income was also positively affected by lower interest expense from the repayment of approximately million in long term debt during the second and third quarters of  and from the non recurring expense from the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million included in discussed below 

table of contents the following table details the impact of certain of the items described above on net loss from continuing operations  loss per share from continuing operations and ebitda from continuing operations year ended december  in thousands expense of early extinguishment of debt  net gain on disposition of real estate management business income tax benefit impact of expense of early extinguishment of debt and gain on asset disposition on loss from continuing operations expense of early extinguishment of debt  net gain on disposition of real estate management business income tax benefit impact of expense of early extinguishment of debt and gain on asset disposition on loss per share from continuing operations impact of expense of early extinguishment of debt and gain on asset disposition on ebitda from continuing operations operating income from continuing operations increased in from and in from  reflecting comparative improvements in revpar  adr and occupancy and increased margins from our hotel segment 
ebitda from continuing operations in increased million to million  or  compared to ebitda in was lower by million compared to due to the expense of million recorded in for the early extinguishment of debt 
ebitda represents net income or loss before interest expense  income tax benefit expense and depreciation and amortization 
we utilize ebitda as a financial measure because management believes that investors find it to be a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on going operations 
we believe it is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures 
ebitda from continuing operations is calculated in the same manner  but excludes the operating activities of business units identified as discontinued 
ebitda is not intended to represent net income loss as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our owned and leased hotels because we believe interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization bear little or no relationship to our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
we generally pay federal and state income taxes on a consolidated basis  taking into account how the applicable taxing laws apply to us in the aggregate 
by excluding taxes on income  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that our hotels cannot control 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on historical cost and other factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  ebitda measures the financial performance of our hotels without regard to their historical cost 
for all of these reasons  we believe that ebitda provides us and investors with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business 
we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations is useful for the same reasons  in addition to using it for comparative purposes for our intended operations going forward 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda from continuing operations excludes the activities of operations we have determined to be discontinued and does not reflect the totality of operations as 
table of contents experienced for the periods presented 
ebitda  as defined by us  may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income  which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands ebitda from continuing operations income tax benefit expense continuing operations interest expense continuing operations depreciation and amortization continuing operations net income loss from continuing operations income loss on discontinued operations net income loss ebitda income tax benefit expense interest expense depreciation and amortization net income loss

vs 
change change change change revenues from continuing operations hotels room revenue food and beverage revenue other hotels revenue total hotels segment revenue franchise and management revenue entertainment revenue other revenue total revenue compared to revenue from the hotels segment increased million  or  compared to primarily due to a increase in rooms revenue driven by a increase in rate and a point increase in occupancy 
in addition to generally strong demand and a positive reaction to our renovated product  hotel revenues were also higher than results due to the displacement of rooms during renovations in  largely completed by the end of the second quarter of our mix of business during included increased room sales generated from on line promotional activity and concentrated efforts in attracting high yield contract business  offset by a shift from lower rate volume and contract business 
food and beverage revenue increased million  or  during from in october  we added the anaheim property and in july we subleased and franchised the red lion sacramento property 
the net impact of these property changes was a decrease in revenues of million 
revenue from the franchise and management segment decreased million primarily due to fewer franchisees in our system during compared to revenues increased million in the entertainment segment  primarily during the fourth quarter of due to revenues generated from our week production of walt disney s the lion king in honolulu  hawaii

compared to during  revenue from the hotels segment increased million  or  compared to rooms revenue increased million  or  driven by rate increases 
occupancy was slightly lower year on year  both due to the impact of rooms displaced by renovations in as well as to our decision to move from lower rate volume and contract business to higher rate and more profitable corporate  transient and group business 
the rate increases were affected both by the mix strategy and capital investment in our hotels 
food and beverage revenue increased in from  primarily due to increased banquet related revenues 
incidental revenues from 
table of contents guest amenities and other sources of revenue for the hotel segment were down between comparative periods  primarily due to the continued decrease in room telephone and movie revenues and the closure of gift shops in two hotels  which have subsequently been leased to third party retail businesses 
in  we completed the implementation of our stay comfortable initiative and began major room renovations in several hotels including new floor and wall coverings  tiled bathroom floors  granite vanities and other bathroom upgrades  enhanced guest room features including new plush pillow top mattresses and upgraded linen and pillow packages  large work desks and ergonomic chairs and amenities such as complimentary wireless internet access 
in  this work was substantially completed and work began on common areas such as lobbies and restaurants 
guest reaction to renovations in the hotels was positive and we experienced a period of strong growth in in our hotels segment 
the adr increases between comparable periods experienced in the first and second quarters of accelerated in the second half of the year 
occupancy was lower in the first half of due to displacement and slightly lower in the second half of as we changed our mix of business 
overall revpar from owned and leased hotels grew by from that experienced in revenue from the franchise and management segment remained steady at million in and included in revenues is a franchise termination fee of  increased revenues from the addition of franchises from previously company owned properties and increased revenues from increased revpar at these hotels 
this impact was offset by million received in for a management contract termination fee triggered by the sale of a property that left our system in entertainment segment revenue increased in from  driven primarily by the result of differences in the type and mix of shows presented 
ticketing revenue in aggregate was relatively constant 
the entertainment segment generates greater revenue when it presents shows on a gross basis  compared to net productions in which it only receives commissions for tickets sold 
during  we presented seven gross shows and two net shows  compared to four gross and four net shows during during the fourth quarter of  we presented a six week net production of walt disney s the lion king in spokane  washington  for which we received commissions for tickets sold and other fees 
other revenue decreased from to primarily as a result of the sale of the real estate management business in  as well as the sale of of the kalispell mall in operating expenses operating expenses include direct operating expenses for each of the operating segments  hotel facility and land lease expense  depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on asset dispositions and undistributed corporate expenses

other segment expenses increased million during  while segment profit grew by million during related to the repurchase of a interest and reconsolidation of the operating results of a retail and hotel property in kalispell  montana in december depreciation and amortization increased during compared to  related directly to our hotel renovations 
the net gain on asset dispositions decreased by million in from  primarily due to a million gain recorded during from the divestment of the real estate management business in april of that year 
for additional information on the sale of the real estate management business  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition during  we recorded a loss of million on sign dispositions at our hotels that have all been replaced upon completion of renovations 
the net gain on asset dispositions also reflects the ongoing recognition of deferred gains on a previously sold office building and a hotel for which we entered into a long term lease arrangement 
undistributed corporate expenses were million higher during compared to primarily attributable to increased audit  legal and outside consultant fees  as well as increased compensation levels  including employee medical costs and sfas r option and espp expenses  offset by lower sarbanes oxley related expenditures 
undistributed corporate expenses include general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expenses  charitable contributions  director and officers insurance  bank service charges and outside accountants and various other consultants expense 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not further distributed 
however  costs that can be identified to a particular segment are distributed  such as accounting  human resources and information technology  and are included in direct expenses

in addition  we expensed approximately million related to unamortized deferred loan fees associated with this debt 
these expenses for the early extinguishment of debt were partially offset by a gain recognized of million related to an incentive achieved for meeting development targets in connection with the renovation and expansion of a hotel 
in total during  we recognized an expense for the early extinguishment of debt of million

the complex was marketed nationally and we received multiple offers at or below that sales price 
the consideration for the sale was provided through a combination of a payment of million in cash  the exchange for redemption of  op units and the assumption of million in long term debt 
this structure allows a portion of our tax on the gain to be deferred  further enhancing our economic return

we are finished with our major renovation initiative for our owned and leased hotels that began in the capital investment program represented one of the most significant facility improvement programs in company history  and we remain committed to ongoing capital improvements in order to continue to enhance the red lion brand by improving our hotel quality to enhance our guests experiences 
we believe that by continuing to improve upon the quality of our existing product in areas where customers quality expectations are growing  we position our hotels well in our existing markets and make the red lion brand more attractive for franchise and other growth opportunities

table of contents in september  we announced a common stock repurchase program for up to million through open market purchases  block purchases or privately negotiated transactions  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
during january  we completed our share repurchase program with the purchase of an additional  shares for an aggregate cost of million

operating lease amounts are net of estimated sublease income of million annually 
with regard to purchase obligations  we are not party to any material agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable or legally binding as to fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or stated price terms 
in july  we entered into an agreement to sublease the red lion hotel sacramento to a third party with an initial lease term expiring in in connection with the sublease agreement  we received deferred lease income of million  which will be amortized over the life of the sublease agreement 
the sublease agreement provides for annual rent payments to us of million  which has been included above to reduce our consolidated annual lease expense by that amount 
as part of the agreement  we have committed to million in tenant improvements and as of december   had spent approximately million of that amount 
in october  we completed an acquisition of a year including extension periods leasehold interest in a hotel in anaheim  california for million  including costs of the acquisition 
as required under the terms of the leasehold agreement  we will pay million per year in lease payments through april  the amounts of which have been reflected in the above table 
at our option  we are entitled to extend the lease for additional terms of five years each  with increases in lease payments tied directly to the consumer price index 
beyond the monthly payments through april  we have not included any additional potential future lease commitment related to the anaheim property in the table above

table of contents other matters franchise and management contracts at december   our system of hotels included one hotel under a management contract and hotels under franchise agreements  representing a total of  rooms 
franchise agreements for three hotels are terminating in the first quarter of  resulting in their removal from the system 
subsequent to december   our one hotel under a management contract did not renew its agreement and has since left our system of hotels 
in july  we entered into an agreement to sublease and franchise the red lion hotel sacramento to a third party with an initial lease term expiring in the sublease agreement provides for annual sublease payments to us of million  which will effectively reduce our consolidated annual hotel facility and land lease expense by that amount 
the franchise agreement provides for royalty fees and the third party has committed to make a multi million dollar investment to further improve and reposition the hotel 
overall  this transaction will have a positive impact on ebitda  as the sublease payment  coupled with the new franchise fees  will exceed the hotel s current ebitda before lease expense 
revenues at the hotel in and through july   the date of transition from an owned leased property to a franchise  were million and million  respectively  with ebitda at the hotel before lease expense of million and  respectively  during those same periods 
the sublease also provides the third party a two year option to purchase the property 
in  we executed new franchise agreements with new owners of two hotels the red lion hotel elko  nevada  and the red lion hotel tacoma  washington 
as part of the agreements  the hotels will undergo renovations to comply with our enhanced red lion brand standards 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a long term franchise agreement with the red lion hotel hillsboro  oregon 
all franchised hotels were required to meet red lion s upscale brand standards by the end of currently  we expect sixteen franchised hotels to meet our elevated brand standards 
we anticipate that between two and four franchised hotels may not meet the elevated brand standards  which may result in the termination of these franchises in the first half of during  the temporary franchise agreement for a hotel in portland  oregon expired and the hotel left the system 
in addition  a limited service property in vancouver  washington left the system following a sale and a franchised hotel in san diego  california ceased being a member of the red lion system during the second quarter of also during the second quarter  a franchised hotel in butte  montana left the system in connection with a legal settlement relating to our acquisition of red lion hotels  inc in seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with more revenues and profits realized from may through october than during the rest of the year 
during  revenues during the second and third quarters approximated and  respectively  of total revenues for the year  compared to revenues of and of total revenues during the first and fourth quarters 
inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our revenues or net income loss during the periods under review 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have also identified our most critical accounting policies 
table of contents and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest s visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry 
our revenues are significantly impacted by global  national and regional economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry  as well as the relative market share of our hotels compared with our competitors 
franchise and management fees received in connection with the franchise of our brand names and management fees we earn from managing third party owned hotels 
franchise and management revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise or management agreements 
entertainment computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway style shows and other special events 
where we act as an agent and receive a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when we are the promoter of an event and are at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
other primarily from rental income received from our direct ownership interest in a retail mall in kalispell  montana that is attached to our red lion hotel 
we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is impacted by  among other things  national and regional economic conditions 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate and prevailing market values  asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the requirements of fin  a company must review all of its uncertain tax positions and make a determination as to whether its position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities 
if a position meets the more likely than not criterion  then the related tax benefit is measured based on the cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement
