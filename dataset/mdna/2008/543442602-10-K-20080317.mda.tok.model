critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
revenue recognition our online advertising revenue is primarily composed of per click fees that we charge customers 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
revenue also includes impression based revenue from banner advertisements  as well as revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our products 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser solutions and banner advertisements are generally recognized once collectability is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ads that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called traffic acquisition costs and are included in cost of revenues 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 

table of contents we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including the adcenter for publishers 
these arrangements include multiple elements revenue sharing based on the publishers customer s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  as well as upfront fees  and license fees 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
affiliate revenue is included in online advertising revenue and is based on commissions received for participation in affiliate programs 
affiliate programs are programs operated by affiliate network services or online merchants  in which merchants pay traffic providers on a cost per acquisition basis 
by participating in affiliate programs  we generate revenue when internet consumers make a purchase from a participating merchant s website after clicking on the merchant s listing in our search results 
revenues from affiliates are earned on a per sale basis or as a percentage of sales rather than a per click basis 
revenue is recognized in the period in which a merchant finalizes a sale and reports to us via our affiliate network 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 
deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
allowance for doubtful accounts determination of collectibility of payments requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes performing initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed on a periodic basis to determine whether a provision or reversal is required 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables 
we will record a reduction of our allowance for doubtful accounts if there is a significant improvement in collection rates or economic conditions are more favorable than we anticipated 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
management s judgment is required in the periodic review of whether a provision or reversal is warranted 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we have recorded goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions 
management exercises judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives  fair value and recoverability of these assets 
the majority of intangible assets are amortized over three to seven years  the period of expected benefit 
goodwill is not amortized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we periodically re assess the valuation and asset lives of intangible assets to conform to changes in management s estimates of future performance 
management considers existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions in such assessments 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and as a result of any event that significantly changes our business 
the company uses market capitalization  as well as cash flow forecasts and other market value indicators to review goodwill for impairment 
cash flow forecasts used in evaluation of goodwill are based on trends of historical performance and management s estimate of future performance 

table of contents deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets which could substantially increase our effective tax rate for such period 
alternatively  if our future taxable income is significantly higher than expected and or we are able to utilize our tax credits  we may be required to reverse all or a significant part of our valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which could substantially reduce our effective tax rate for such period 
therefore  any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
see note income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
internal use software development costs we account for internal use software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
in accordance with the capitalization criteria of sop  we have capitalized external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the internal use computer software project 
management s judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software and to capitalize costs in accordance with sop restructuring charges we have recorded a restructuring accrual related to closing certain leased facilities  as well as severance costs related to workforce reduction in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal of activities sfas 
management s judgment is required when estimating when the redundant facilities will be subleased and at what rate they will be subleased 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which revised sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
sfas r is a complex accounting standard  the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income loss

we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund our operations and capital expenditures  take advantage of favorable business opportunities  develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure  develop new product and service offerings  take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets or respond to competitive pressures 
in addition  unanticipated developments in the short term  such as the entry into agreements requiring large cash payments or the acquisition of businesses with negative cash flows  may necessitate additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution

the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  we maintain directors and officers insurance coverage that may contribute  up to certain limits  a portion of any future amounts paid for indemnification of directors and officers 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
historically  we have not incurred any losses or recorded any liabilities related to performance under these types of indemnities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for interest rate changes relates primarily to our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
we had no derivative financial instruments as of december  or we invest our excess cash in debt and equity instruments of high quality corporate issuers with original maturities greater than three months and effective maturities less than two years 
the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument is limited 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
during the year ended december   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our marketable investment securities and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of approximately million in cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of december  in a declining interest rate environment  as short term investments mature  reinvestment occurs at less favorable market rates 
given the short term nature of certain investments  anticipated declining interest rates will negatively impact our investment income
