table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from higher net income  reduced by cash used for working capital to support our growth 
we expect our available cash and fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund fiscal year operating needs  shareholder dividends  planned capital expenditures and share repurchases 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity in fluid management  new products and services  productivity programs  and replacement items 
on october  we announced that our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to three million of our currently outstanding common shares 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  an increase from million in fiscal our capital expenditures were primarily for information technology systems and for capacity expansion in the fluid management and process solutions segments

six banks participate in our revolving credit agreement 
we are not dependent on any single bank for our financing needs 
from available cash balances  we repaid million of our senior notes on the may  due date 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
in instances where we have equipment installation obligations  the revenue related to the installation service is deferred until installation is complete 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  litigation  product liability and environmental accruals  tax contingencies  stock option valuation  goodwill valuation and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
the inventory to which this reserve relates is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service and delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation and product liability reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  were performed at year end for fiscal our annual impairment test date using a discounted cash flow methodology income approach 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the 
table of contents businesses for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests are reflected in operating income in our consolidated statement of operations 
other intangibles are evaluated periodically if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income or loss when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for a funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
at august  the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august   the weighted average discount rate used to value the plan liabilities was 
we determine our discount rate based on an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by million  and a comparable decrease in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our non us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  swiss francs and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit for fiscal would have decreased by million and our cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
at august   million of our outstanding debt had a weighted average fixed interest rate of and million had a weighted average variable interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities and related weighted average interest rates of our debt obligations at august  by maturity dates us dollar us dollar us dollar fixed rate fixed rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate amount rate in thousands  except percents thereafter total fair value 
table of contents following is information regarding our long term contractual obligations and other commitments outstanding as of august  payments due by period two to long term contractual one year three four to after five obligations total or less years five years years in thousands debt obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations operating leases consist primarily of building and equipment leases 
unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of  including interest and penalties  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments 
the only other commercial commitments outstanding were standby letters of credit of  of this outstanding amount  is due within a year   within two to three years and  due within four to five years
