critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the consolidated financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
when applying accounting policies in such areas that are subjective in nature  management must use its best judgment to arrive at the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  and the timing of loan charge offs 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio 
current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the views of bank regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  and peer comparisons are also factors 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction and change in the interest rate environment  which may impact a borrower s ability to pay  legislation impacting the banking industry  and environmental and economic conditions specific to the bank s service areas 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
securities securities available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
rather  it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
management reviews criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  as well as the reasons for the decline  to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
deferred income taxes under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are subject to management s judgment based upon available evidence that future realization is more likely than not 
loan income recognition interest income on loans is accrued at the contractual rate based on the principal outstanding 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the contractual loan terms 
accrual of interest is discontinued when its receipt is in doubt  which typically occurs when a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest 
any interest accrued to income in the year when interest accruals are discontinued is generally reversed 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when a loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to satisfy the principal balance and accrued interest 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to pay and remain current 
payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
loan repurchases our sales agreements with investors who buy our loans generally contain covenants which may require us to repurchase loans under certain provisions  including delinquencies  or return premiums paid by those investors should the loan be paid off early 
these covenants are usual and customary within the mortgage banking industry 
we maintain a reserve included in other liabilities for potential losses relating to these sales covenants 
loans repurchased are accounted for under aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
under the sop  loans repurchased must be recorded at market value at the time of repurchase with any deficiency for recording the loan compared to proceeds paid charged to earnings 
repurchased loans are carried on the balance sheet in the loan portfolio 
any further change in the underlying risk profile or further impairment is recorded as a specific reserve in the allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses 
repurchased loans which are foreclosed upon are transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure at the time of ratification of foreclosure and recorded at estimated fair value 
these assets remain in real estate acquired through foreclosure until their disposition 
any declines in value during this time reduce the carrying amounts through a charge to noninterest expense 
real estate acquired through foreclosure we record foreclosed real estate assets at the lower of cost or estimated fair value on their acquisition dates and at the lower of such initial amount or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs thereafter 
estimated fair value is based upon many subjective factors  including location and condition of the property and current economic conditions 
because the calculation of fair value relies on estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  results may differ from our estimates 
write downs subsequent to transfer are included in our noninterest expenses  along with operating income  net of related expenses of such properties and gains or losses realized upon disposition
