item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview abaxis  inc abaxis  us  or we develops  manufactures  markets and sells portable blood analysis systems for use in any human or veterinary patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a blood analysis system  consisting of a compact portable analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests on human patients and tests on veterinary patients 
we manufacture the system in our manufacturing facilities in union city  california and we market our blood chemistry analyzers in both the medical market and in the veterinary market  as described below 
medical market we currently market the blood analysis system in the medical market under the name piccolo xpress tm 
through october  we marketed the blood analysis system in the medical market as the piccolo  now referred to as the piccolo classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of piccolo xpress and piccolo classic chemistry analyzers 
veterinary market we currently market the blood analysis system in the veterinary market under the name vetscan vs 
through march  we marketed the blood analysis system in the veterinary market as the vetscan  now referred to as the vetscan classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan vs and vetscan classic chemistry analyzers 
in september  we introduced a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hm tm 
the vetscan hm offers a parameter complete blood count cbc analysis  including a five part differential cell counter specifically designed for veterinary applications 
in may  we introduced a veterinary hematology instrument that offers an parameter cbc analysis  including a three part white blood cell differential  marketed originally as the vetscan hmii  and is now referred to as the vetscan hm tm 
we currently purchase the hematology instruments from diatron mi kft 
of budapest  hungary 
through april  we marketed a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hmt 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan hm  vetscan hm  vetscan hmii and vetscan hmt hematology instruments 
our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty  and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control  including inventory or timing considerations by our distributors 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our piccolo and vetscan products and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the 
table of contents sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
revenues from such sales is allocated separately to the instruments and incentives based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenues allocated to incentives is deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer or is recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
at march   and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances was   and  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances was million  million and  respectively 
the fluctuation in balances is due to the types of customer incentives programs offered during the period  depends on when the free goods are shipped to the customer and the maintenance period of the maintenance agreements 
we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded according to the policies described above 
distributor and customer rebates 
we offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period 
the distributor pricing rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during the qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to customers who purchase specific instruments during a promotional period 
cash rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program  which started in fiscal  is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of reagent discs during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to three months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to distributor pricing rebates were   and  respectively 
the changes in the rebate accrual at each fiscal year end are based upon distributors meeting the purchase requirements during the quarter 
rebate programs offered to customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
generally  the customer rebate program relates to the sale of certain products or instruments during a specified promotional period 
as part of the rebate program  a customer receives a cash rebate upon purchasing certain instruments in the north america market during a promotional period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of instruments sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of a rebate 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction of gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals 
table of contents from the date of sale ranges from one to six months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to customer rebates were   and  respectively 
the changes in the rebate accrual were due to the type of marketing promotions offered during the fiscal year and timing of the rebate obligations paid to customers 
the following table is an analysis of the roll forward activities for the distributor and customer rebate accruals in thousands balance at beginning balance at of year provisions payments end of year year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates sales and other allowances 
we estimate a provision for defective reagent discs as part of sales allowances when we issue credits to customers for defective reagent discs 
we also establish  upon shipment of our products to distributors  a provision for potentially defective reagent discs  based on estimates derived from historical experience 
the provision for potentially defective reagent discs was recorded in sales allowances  using internal data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel  the lag time for customers to report defective reagent discs and the historical rates of defective reagent discs 
the balances related to sales allowance for defective reagent discs at march   and were   and  respectively 
starting on july   the provision for potentially defective reagent discs is recorded as part of warranty reserves  instead of sales allowances  since we replace defective reagent discs rather than issue a credit to customers 
changes in our estimates for accruals related to provisions for defective reagent discs have not been material to our financial position or results of operations 
in the future  the actual defective reagent discs may exceed our estimates  which could adversely affect our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 
fair value of investments 
various assumptions are used in the valuation models to estimate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities  including a security s expected future cash flows  market rate of return and its term 
these assumptions  assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties  are difficult to predict and require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions  applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 

table of contents warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation on instruments is two years 
the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenue is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on historical experience  estimated product failure rates  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes 
a provision for defective reagent discs is recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of revenues 
prior to july   we primarily issued a credit to customers for defective reagent discs and  therefore  the provision for estimated costs for defective reagent discs  which includes the replacement costs and freight of a defective reagent disc  was recorded as part of sales and other allowances 
starting on july   the provision for defective reagent discs is recorded as part of warranty reserves  since we replace defective reagent discs rather than issue a credit to customers 
we analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance of warranty reserves each quarter 
the determination of warranty reserves requires us to make estimates of the expected costs to repair or replace the instruments and to replace defective reagent discs under warranty 
if actual repair or replacement costs of instruments or replacement costs of reagent discs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
long lived assets 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is reviewed for impairment  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts to be recovered 
share based compensation expense 
on april   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
prior to april   we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and other related guidance and therefore  no employee compensation cost had been recognized for share based awards in financial statements prior to april  because we issued stock options with an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted prior to march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires highly subjective assumptions  as described below 

table of contents risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected stock price volatility we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
expected term we estimate the expected term of stock options granted based on historical exercise and post vesting termination patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
expected dividends we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future  consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
for restricted stock units  the assumptions to calculate compensation expense is based on the fair value of our stock at the grant date 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as required by sfas no 
r  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated based on the awards expected to vest and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based awards that are granted and cancelled prior to vesting and upon historical experience of employee turnover 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
the adoption of sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal had a material impact on our earnings per share and on our financial statements for fiscal and  and we expect that it will materially impact our financial statements in the foreseeable future 
the impact of sfas no 
r on our financial results is disclosed in note share based compensation in the notes to financial statement in this annual report on form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes with respect to our short term and long term investments and line of credit 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in auction rate securities  certificate of deposits  corporate debt securities and municipal bonds 
our investment objective is to invest excess cash in cash equivalents and in various types of investments to maximize yields without significantly increased risk 
at march   our short term investments totaled million and our long term investments totaled million 
unrealized losses  net of related income taxes of million are temporary and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the short term investments at march  consisted primarily of certificate of deposits and municipal bonds 
the long term investments at march  consisted of auction rate securities 
although auction rate securities may have maturities beyond one year  these securities were historically classified as short term  based on their highly liquid nature and due to the frequency with which the interest rate is reset  accordingly we have had the ability to quickly liquidate these securities in the past 
the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if the credit market does not improve  auctions for our invested amounts may continue to fail 
if an auction fails for securities in which we have invested  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par  should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
in the event we need or desire to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
if a buyer is found but is unwilling to purchase the investments at par  we may incur a loss 
the fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets 
if conditions in the credit markets deteriorate further causing additional auctions to fail  the funds associated with these auction rate securities may not be accessible for an undetermined period of time  and we may be required to record losses or an impairment charge on our auction rate securities in future quarters 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments and our expected operating cash flows  we currently do not anticipate these investments in auction rate securities will affect our ability to execute our current business  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents we have the ability to hold the certificate of deposits and municipal bonds until maturity and therefore  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have not experienced any significant losses on our investment portfolio 
for our line of credit  which provides for borrowings of up to million  the interest rate is equal to the bank s prime rate minus  which totaled at march  consequently  an increase in the prime rate would expose us to higher interest expenses 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in the prime rate applied to our line of credit balance at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as there was no amount outstanding on our line of credit at march  as a matter of management policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we do enter into such transactions in the future  such items will be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we operate primarily in the united states and a majority of our revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and capital purchasing activities for fiscal were transacted in us dollars 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the hematology instruments and hematology reagent kits purchased from diatron messtechnik gmbh  which are denominated in euros 
additionally  operations from our germany sales office are stated in euros and translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rates 
such operations have not been significant to date 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro currency  the translation of the foreign currency denominated transactions may result in reduced cost of revenues and operating expenses 
similarly  our cost of revenues and operating expenses will increase  if the us dollar weakens against the euro currency
