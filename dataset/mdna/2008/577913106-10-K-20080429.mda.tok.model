the resort business of palmas competes with similar businesses in the caribbean  florida and other vacation holiday destinations

racing operations general the company indirectly owns shrp  ltd  which owns and operates sam houston race park  a texas class horse racing facility located within the greater houston metropolitan area and valley race park  a greyhound racing facility located in harlingen  texas 
in january  a subsidiary of the company  laredo race park llc laredo llc  applied to the texas racing commission the racing commission for an additional license to construct and operate a class horse racing facility in laredo  texas 
following a hearing on laredo llc s application and that of a competing applicant  in september  two state administrative law judges recommended to the racing commission that laredo llc be awarded the license 
the racing commission on march  ruled that both laredo llc and the competing applicant be awarded licenses for the laredo area 
the racing commission later awarded laredo llc its license  effective as of september  racing operations and facilities sam houston race park and valley race park offer pari mutuel wagering on live thoroughbred  quarter horse and greyhound racing during meets approved by the racing commission on a yearly basis and on simulcast horse and greyhound racing throughout the year 
under the texas racing act and related regulations the racing act  commission revenues for both facilities are a designated portion of the pari mutuel handle 
sam houston race park had days of live racing in  and has of live racing days scheduled for valley race park had live racing days during  and has live racing days scheduled for revenues are also earned on simulcast racing through both guest simulcast arrangements the receipt by sam houston race park and valley race park of live broadcasts of racing conducted at other racetracks and host simulcast arrangements the live broadcast to other race tracks and off track wagering sites of racing conducted at sam houston race park and valley race park 
sam houston race park and valley race park also derive revenues from food and beverage sales  admission and parking fees  group sales and advertising sales 
regulation of racing operations the ownership and operation of horse and greyhound racetracks in texas are subject to significant regulation by the racing commission under the racing act 
the racing act provides  among other things  for the allocation of wagering proceeds among betting participants  purses  racetracks  the state of texas and for other purposes  and empowers the racing commission to license and regulate substantially all aspects of horse and greyhound racing in the state 
the racing commission must approve the number of live racing days that may be offered each year  as well as all simulcast agreements 
class horse racetracks in texas are entitled to conduct at least seventeen weeks of live racing for each breed of horses thoroughbreds and quarter horses  while greyhound tracks are entitled to conduct live racing nearly year round 
marketing and competition shrp  ltd 
s management believes that the majority of sam houston race park s patrons reside within a mile radius  which includes most of the greater houston metropolitan area  and that a secondary market of occasional patrons exists outside the mile radius but within a mile radius of the facility 
sam houston race park uses a number of marketing strategies in an attempt to reach these people and make them more frequent visitors to sam houston race park 
recent strategic changes include increased newspaper ad sizes  expansion of website capabilities  radio advertising  increased marketing of items offered outside of the racing product  a vip program with exclusive promotional offers  and greater focus on casual and event oriented customers 
valley race park employs similar strategies to attract patrons 
both race parks also rent out facilities and grounds for group events  which increase revenues and expose the facility to potential customers even though the events are often unrelated to racing 
in an effort to increase attendance on days with live racing  sam houston race park in june expanded and enhanced its summer concert series  including improving its facilities to allow the concerts to be held on the race track s infield 
sam houston race park competes with other forms of wagering and entertainment  including a louisiana racino horse or dog tracks with slot machines or other forms of gaming located approximately miles from houston  casinos located approximately miles from houston  a greyhound racetrack located miles away from houston  a wide range of sporting events and other entertainment activities in the houston area  the texas state lottery  and charitable bingo 
other competitive pressures include simulcast signals broadcast by racinos  which are able to offer larger purses and competitive fields  resorts with gaming  and increasing use of the internet for horse wagering and gaming  including internet betting services with customer incentives such as cash rebates 
sam houston race park could in the future also compete with other forms of gambling in texas  including casino gambling on indian reservations elsewhere 
while sam houston race park believes that the location of sam houston race park is a competitive advantage over the other more distant gaming ventures mentioned above  the most significant challenges for sam houston race park are to maintain its customer base in spite of the above competitive pressures and to develop and educate new racing fans in a market where pari mutuel wagering had been absent from the s to other competitive factors faced by sam houston race park include the allocation of sufficient live racing days by the racing commission and attraction of a sufficient number and quality of race horses to run at sam houston race park  particularly in view of the larger purses able to be offered by racinos 
competitive factors faced by valley race park include the texas state lottery  charitable bingo and internet based gaming  as well as the attraction of sufficient greyhounds to run live racing  along with the ability of valley race park to market its simulcast signal due to its brief live racing season 
the texas legislature convenes its regular session every other year 
it is expected that this body will  during the next regular legislative session that begins in january and lasts through may  consider measures to enhance state revenues though additional forms of gaming such as video lottery terminals at existing horse and dog racing tracks  gaming on indian reservations  and full casinos 
the company will vigorously pursue any legislation that is favorable to it 
as some legislation would require the approval of two thirds of each legislative house and a majority of texas voters  no assurance can be given that any such legislation will be enacted or become effective 
moreover  it is impossible to determine what the provisions of any such legislation would be or its effect on the company 
employees as of march   the company s racing operations had approximately full and part time employees and approximately additional seasonal employees 
forest products operations reorganization proceedings of palco and its subsidiaries bankruptcy filings on january   the filing date  palco and its five wholly owned subsidiaries  including scopac  filed the bankruptcy cases  separate voluntary petitions in the bankruptcy court for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the six companies that filed for voluntary protection are palco  britt  sdllc  salmon creek llc salmon creek and scotia inn scotia inn the palco debtors and scopac 
the bankruptcy cases are being jointly administered  with the debtors managing their business in the ordinary course as debtors in possession subject to the control and supervision of the bankruptcy court 
as a result of the bankruptcy cases  the company deconsolidated the debtor s financial results beginning january  see note  deconsolidation of palco and its subsidiaries 
the filing of the bankruptcy cases was precipitated by liquidity shortfalls at palco and scopac and their resultant inability to make january interest payments on their respective debt obligations  arising from regulatory restrictions and limitations on timber harvest  increased timber harvesting costs and depressed lumber prices 
both scopac and palco undertook various efforts in to generate additional liquidity to satisfy their respective debt service obligations  however  the cash generated from their efforts  together with their cash flows from operations  was not sufficient to cover their respective interest payment shortfalls in january as of the filing date  scopac s indebtedness consisted of its class a  class a and class a timber collateralized notes due the scopac timber notes million principal outstanding as of december  and a line of credit with a group of banks pursuant to which scopac was permitted to borrow to pay up to one year s interest on the scopac timber notes the scopac line of credit million principal outstanding as of december  
these obligations are each secured by i scopac s timber  timberlands and timber rights  ii certain contract rights and other assets  iii the proceeds of the foregoing and iv the funds held in various segregated accounts related to the scopac timber notes 
annual interest obligations related to scopac s debt facilities were approximately million as of december  as of the filing date  palco s principal indebtedness consisted of a five year million secured term loan the palco term loan million principal outstanding as of december  and a five year million secured asset based revolving credit facility the palco revolving credit facility million of borrowings outstanding and million of letters of credit issued as of december  
these facilities were secured by the stock of palco owned by mgi  and substantially all of the assets of the palco debtors other than palco s equity interest in scopac 
marathon structured finance fund lp marathon provided both the palco revolving credit facility and the palco term loan 
the palco revolving credit facility was subsequently retired with the dip facility  a debtor in possession revolving credit facility provided by marathon  which facility is described below under palco debtors liquidity 
effect of the bankruptcy filings the outstanding principal of  and accrued interest on  all long term debt of the debtors became immediately due and payable as a result of the commencement of the bankruptcy cases 
however  the vast majority of the claims in existence at the filing date including claims for principal and accrued interest on the debtors indebtedness and substantially all legal proceedings are stayed deferred while the debtors continue to operate their businesses 
the bankruptcy court  however  upon motion of the debtors  permitted the debtors to pay or otherwise honor certain unsecured pre filing date claims  including employee wages and benefits and customary claims in the ordinary course of business  subject to certain limitations 
the debtors overall objectives in the bankruptcy cases are to achieve an operational and financial restructuring of each of the debtors long term debt obligations in view of estimated lower harvest levels  increased regulatory compliance costs and depressed lumber prices  and to continue their businesses 
there can be no assurance that the debtors will be able to attain these objectives 
if the debtors are unable to attain a successful operational and financial reorganization  the debtors could be forced to surrender all or substantially all of their assets to their creditors or be forced to liquidate their assets pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the outcome of the bankruptcy cases is impossible to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the debtors  on the interests of creditors  and on the company 
recent bankruptcy developments on september   the debtors filed a proposed joint plan of reorganization during the period when a debtor has the sole right to propose and seek approval of a plan of reorganization the exclusivity period 
on december   the bankruptcy court approved an agreement by the debtors and other parties to terminate the exclusivity period and permit the filing of plans of reorganization by the debtors  as well as the unsecured creditors committee the committee  marathon and the holders of scopac s timber notes 
on the january  deadline  marathon and the holders of the scopac timber notes filed proposed plans of reorganization 
the same day  the debtors filed an amended joint plan of reorganization the joint plan  and palco and scopac each filed alternative stand alone plans of reorganization the alternative plans 
the company is a co proponent of each of the joint plan and the palco and scopac alternative plans 
the joint plan provides for the payment in full of all claims and the continuation of the businesses  but at harvest levels that are lower than historical rates 
under the joint plan  the company s indirect equity interests in both palco and scopac would be substantially diluted  such that the company would lose a controlling interest in both companies 
additionally  certain assets owned by palco would be transferred to palco s secured lender in satisfaction of the palco term loan 
the joint plan also provides for important economic contributions by the company  including i consenting to the dilution of its indirect equity interest in both palco and scopac  ii providing additional liquidity to palco throughout the remainder of the case through redwood log and or lumber purchases either directly or indirectly in an amount not to exceed million  subject to board approval  iii making a million cash equity contribution to reorganized palco on the effective date  iv forgiving million of intercompany indebtedness  v using its best efforts to assist the reorganized debtors in obtaining exit financing  and vi assisting the reorganized debtors by providing its extensive real estate expertise in connection with various post confirmation aspects of the joint plan 
the debtors do not believe that the joint plan is eligible to be crammed down forced on creditors who vote against it 
accordingly  alternative plans were developed to provide the debtors an alternative to the joint plan in the event secured creditors vote against the joint plan 
the alternative plans of palco and scopac provide for a the delivery of a substantial portion of scopac s timberlands  acres to the holders of the scopac timber notes in full satisfaction of the obligations under the scopac timber notes  and b the delivery of all of palco s assets other than its interest in scopac and its interest in the headwaters claim  as defined below under regulatory and environmental factors to marathon 
the debtors remaining obligations including those under the dip facility would be paid with the proceeds from exit financing secured by the remaining assets owned by palco 
these assets would consist of palco s equity interest in the reorganized scopac whose assets would consist of  remaining acres of timberlands  including  acres of the largest stands of old growth redwood trees remaining under private ownership and the headwaters claim and palco s interest in the headwaters claim 
both the joint plan and the alternative plans would require  among other things  that the debtors obtain exit financing approximately million under the joint plan and approximately million under the alternative plans 
both the plan of reorganization filed by marathon and the plan of reorganization filed by the holders of the scopac timber notes  if confirmed  would result in the loss entirely of the company s indirect equity interests in both palco and scopac 
voting for all of the plans has occurred and the joint plan and the palco alternative plan did not obtain sufficient votes to be confirmed 
without sufficient votes among other things  these plans cannot legally be confirmed 
the scopac alternative plan  the plan of reorganization filed by marathon and the plan of reorganization filed by the holders of the scopac timber notes did receive sufficient votes to be confirmed 
there is substantial uncertainty as to which plan of reorganization  if any  will be confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
if no plan is confirmed  the bankruptcy court may elect to convert the bankruptcy cases to a chapter liquidation proceeding 
the confirmation hearing  at which the bankruptcy court will consider the plans of reorganization filed by marathon  the holders of scopac timber notes  and the debtors  began in april and has not yet concluded 
the outcome of the bankruptcy cases is impossible to predict and  and as noted above  could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the debtors  on the interests of creditors  and on the company 
palco debtors liquidity on august   the palco debtors closed on the dip facility  a million debtor in possession revolving credit facility that matures on the earliest of  among other things  i the sale of substantially all of the assets of the palco debtors  ii an event of default  iii the effective date of a plan of reorganization for palco  or iv august  the dip facility was provided by marathon and was used to retire the palco revolving credit facility 
under the dip facility  the lender has a super priority claim  which provides for payment of the dip facility before any other secured or unsecured creditors and equity holders of the palco debtors can be paid 
the dip facility contains restrictive financial covenants that  among others  require the palco debtors to maintain a minimum level of ebitda and meet weekly cash flow projections 
the palco debtors are currently in default under the dip facility 
the dip facility is fully drawn and palco continues to closely monitor and manage its cash resources 
during january and early february  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of maxxam purchased million of logs and lumber from palco to provide additional liquidity 
in spite of these purchases in february  palco did not have sufficient liquidity to make an approximate million log payment due to scopac  palco and scopac are working towards an agreement with respect to this missed payment 
there can be no assurance that the palco debtors will continue to have sufficient liquidity to operate or that palco s dip lender will not take action as a result of the default under the dip facility 
should either occur  the palco debtors may not be able to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
scopac liquidity scopac has been authorized by the bankruptcy court to fund budgeted ongoing operating and bankruptcy related costs using operating cash flow and  to the extent needed  funds available in scopac s scheduled amortization reserve account sar account  an account established to support principal payments on the scopac timber notes  provided that no more than million in withdrawals from the sar account are outstanding at any given time 
scopac expects these sources of liquidity to be adequate to enable scopac to continue its operations 
if these sources of liquidity are not adequate  and if scopac is unable to obtain additional sources of liquidity and the necessary bankruptcy court approval to utilize such additional sources of liquidity  scopac may not be able to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
potential impact on registrant and certain related entities the bankruptcy cases could result in claims against and could have adverse impacts on maxxam parent and its affiliates  including mghi and or mgi 
for example  under erisa  if palco s pension plan were to be terminated under certain circumstances  maxxam parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries would be jointly and severally liable for any unfunded pension plan obligations 
the estimated unfunded termination obligation attributable to palco s pension plan as of december   was approximately million based upon annuity placement interest rate assumptions as of such date 
in addition  all of the plans of reorganization that have been filed would require the utilization of all or a substantial portion of the company s net operating losses or other tax attributes for federal and state income tax purposes  and could result in mgi incurring significant tax liabilities that would not be offset by these tax attributes 
moreover  the plans of reorganization filed by marathon and the holders of the scopac timber notes provide for litigation trusts  which could result in claims against the company and certain of its affiliates 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of the bankruptcy cases 
principal assets palco owns and manages  principally through scopac  approximately  acres of virtually contiguous commercial timberlands located in humboldt county along the northern california coast  an area which has very favorable soil and climate conditions for growing timber 
palco also owns substantially all of the assets in the town of scotia  california  including a sawmill and other industrial use facilities  a co generation plant  homes  various commercial properties  and all of the land associated with these assets 
a number of palco employees live in scotia 
products redwood lumber has historically been palco s largest product category 
redwood is commercially available only along the northern coast of california and possesses certain unique characteristics that permit it to be sold at a premium to many other wood products 
such characteristics include its natural beauty  superior ability to retain paint and other finishes  dimensional stability and innate resistance to decay  insects and chemicals 
typical applications include exterior siding  trim and fascia for both residential and commercial construction  outdoor furniture  decks  planters  retaining walls and other specialty applications 
redwood also has a variety of industrial applications because of its chemical resistance and because it does not impart any taste or odor to liquids or solids 
upper grade redwood lumber  which is derived primarily from larger diameter logs and is characterized by an absence of knots and other defects  little to no sapwood  and a tighter grain  is used primarily in distinctive interior and exterior applications 
common grade redwood lumber  historically palco s largest volume product  has many of the same aesthetic and structural qualities as upper grade redwood  but has some knots  sapwood and a coarser grain 
such lumber is commonly used for construction purposes  including outdoor structures such as decks and fencing 
marketing the housing  construction and remodeling markets are the primary markets for palco s lumber products 
palco s goal is to maintain a wide geographic distribution of its products 
palco s accounts are primarily wholesale  followed by industrial end users  manufacturers  retailers and exporters 
palco s redwood lumber is sold throughout the entire united states  as well as to export markets 
palco markets its products through its own sales staff  which focuses primarily on domestic sales 
competition palco s lumber is sold in highly competitive markets 
competition is generally based upon a combination of price  service  product availability and product quality 
palco s products compete not only with other wood products but with metals  masonry  plastic and other construction materials made from non renewable resources 
the level of demand for palco s products is dependent on such broad factors as overall economic conditions  interest rates and demographic trends 
in addition  competitive considerations  such as total industry production and competitors pricing  as well as the price of other construction products  affect the sales prices for palco s lumber products 
competition in the common grade redwood lumber market is intense  with palco competing with numerous large and small lumber producers 
employees as of march   the company s forest products operations had approximately employees 
intercompany agreements palco  scopac and salmon creek are parties to several agreements between or among themselves  principally a master purchase agreement pursuant to which palco purchases logs from scopac and a services agreement pursuant to which palco performs a variety of services for scopac 
the purchase price under the master purchase agreement is based upon stumpage prices  as published by the california state board of equalization  with palco being responsible for harvesting and removal costs 
under the services agreement  palco provides a number of operational  management and related services not performed by scopac s own employees with respect to the scopac s timber properties  such as maintaining and rehabilitating roads  building new roads  performing replanting and reforestation services  protecting against fire  insects and disease  and defending challenges of scopac s timber harvesting plans 
regulatory and environmental factors the businesses of palco and scopac are subject to a variety of california and federal laws and regulations 
the provisions include the california forest practice act that sets forth detailed requirements for the conduct of timber harvesting operations in the state  including regulatory approval of detailed timber harvesting plans and sustained yield requirements 
the companies are also subject to the federal and california endangered species acts  providing in general for the protection and conservation of specifically listed wildlife and plants  the california environmental quality act  providing for the protection of the state s air and water quality and wildlife  and the california porter cologne water quality control act and federal clean water act  providing for the protection of the water quality of rivers and streams 
moreover  palco and scopac are parties to a year habitat conservation plan completed in connection with the headwaters agreement described below 
under the habitat conservation plan  harvesting activities are prohibited or restricted on various areas of the companies timberlands  in some cases for the entire year term of the plan  including buffer areas alongside watercourses subject to potential adjustment up or down pursuant to an ongoing watershed analysis process 
the habitat conservation plan also imposes a number of operational requirements and restrictions on palco and scopac 
in march  palco  scopac and salmon creek consummated the headwaters agreement the headwaters agreement with the state of california and the united states 
pursuant to the headwaters agreement  approximately  acres of timberlands owned by the three companies were transferred to the united states government in exchange for million  approximately  acres of timberlands  and approval by the federal and state governments of habitat conservation and sustained yield plans and various related governmental approvals 
in december  palco and scopac filed a claim the headwaters claim with the california claims board alleging that the state of california and certain of its agencies had substantially impaired the contractual and legal rights of palco and scopac under the headwaters agreement and the related permits  authorizations and approvals  resulting in substantial damages to the companies 
as the claims board failed to approve or deny the headwaters claim by the statutory deadline  the claim was treated as having been denied 
this permitted the companies to file a suit for damages in california state court  with palco and scopac doing so on december  in the superior court of fresno  california no

risk factors risks related to the bankruptcy cases the bankruptcies of palco and its subsidiaries  including scopac  create significant risks and uncertainties 
on january   each of the palco debtors and scopac filed the bankruptcy cases separate  voluntary petitions in the bankruptcy court for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the filing of the bankruptcy cases was precipitated by liquidity shortfalls at palco and scopac and their resultant inability to make january interest payments on their respective debt obligations  arising from regulatory restrictions and limitations on timber harvest  increased timber harvesting costs and depressed lumber prices 
the bankruptcies of the debtors create significant risks and uncertainties for the debtors and the company  including  but not limited to  those described herein 
the outcome of the bankruptcy cases is impossible to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the debtors  on the interests of creditors  and on the company 
the debtors may not be able to reorganize successfully  and the company could lose some or all of its equity ownership interest 
the debtors overall objectives in the bankruptcy cases are to achieve an operational and financial restructuring of each of the debtors long term debt obligations in view of estimated lower harvest levels  increased regulatory compliance costs and depressed lumber prices  and to continue their businesses 
there can be no assurance that the debtors will be able to attain these objectives 
if the debtors are unable to attain a successful operational and financial reorganization  the debtors could be forced to surrender all or substantially all of their assets to their creditors or be forced to liquidate their assets pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the outcome of the bankruptcy cases is impossible to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the businesses of the debtors  on the interests of creditors  and on the company 
the debtors have filed the joint plan and the alternative plans  and marathon and the holders of the scopac timber notes have also filed plans of reorganization 
before any of such plans can be implemented  it must be confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
there is substantial uncertainty as to which plan of reorganization  if any  will be confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
if no plan is confirmed  the bankruptcy court may elect to convert the bankruptcy cases to a chapter liquidation proceeding 
under the joint plan  the company s indirect equity interests in both palco and scopac would be substantially diluted  such that the company would lose a controlling interest in both companies 
under the alternative plans  palco and scopac would transfer a substantial portion of their assets to their principal creditors essentially all but  acres of timberlands and the headwaters claim 
in addition  both the plans of reorganization filed by marathon and the plan of reorganization filed by the holders of the scopac timber notes would result in the loss entirely of the company s indirect equity interest in both palco and scopac 
the debtors developed the alternative plans as they do not believe the joint plan can be crammed down forced on creditors who voted against it 
while the debtors believe that the alternative plans satisfy all requirements necessary for confirmation by the bankruptcy court  there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will reach the same conclusion 
both joint plan and the alternative plans would require  among other things  that the debtors obtain exit financing approximately million under the joint plan and million under the alternative plans 
voting for all of the plans has occurred and the joint plan and the palco alternative plan did not obtain sufficient votes to be confirmed 
without sufficient votes among other things  these plans cannot legally be confirmed 
the scopac alternative plan  the plan of reorganization filed by marathon and the plan of reorganization filed by the holders of the scopac timber notes did receive sufficient votes to be confirmed 
the palco debtors and scopac may be unable to obtain sufficient additional liquidity to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter on august   the palco debtors closed on the dip facility  a million debtor in possession revolving credit facility 
the dip facility contains restrictive financial covenants that  among others  require the palco debtors to maintain a minimum level of ebitda and meet weekly cash flow projections 
however  the operating cash flow estimates used to establish the ebitda maintenance covenant and the weekly cash flow projections are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the palco debtors are currently in default under the dip facility 
there can be no assurance that the palco debtors will continue to have sufficient liquidity to operate or that palco s dip lender will not take action as a result of the default under the dip facility 
should either occur  the palco debtors may not be able to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
scopac has been authorized by the bankruptcy court to fund budgeted ongoing operating and bankruptcy related costs using operating cash flow and  to the extent needed  funds available in the sar account subject to no more than million in withdrawals from the sar account being outstanding at any given time 
scopac expects these sources of liquidity to be adequate to enable scopac to continue its operations 
if these sources of liquidity are not adequate  and if scopac is unable to obtain additional sources of liquidity and the necessary bankruptcy court approval to utilize such additional sources of liquidity  scopac may not be able to continue operations and reorganize successfully under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcies of scopac and the palco debtors could result in claims against  and potential liabilities for  maxxam parent and its affiliates 
the bankruptcy cases could result in claims against and could have adverse impacts on maxxam parent and its affiliates  including mghi and or mgi 
for example  under erisa  if palco s pension plan were to be terminated under certain circumstances  maxxam parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries would be jointly and severally liable for any unfunded pension plan obligations 
the estimated unfunded termination obligation attributable to palco s pension plan as of december   was approximately million based upon annuity placement interest rate assumptions as of such date 
in addition  all of the plans of reorganization that have been filed would require the utilization of all or a substantial portion of the company s net operating losses or other tax attributes for federal and state income tax purposes  and could result in mgi incurring significant tax liabilities that would not be offset by these tax attributes 
moreover  the plans of reorganization filed by marathon and the holders of the scopac timber notes provide for litigation trusts  which could result in claims against the company and certain of its affiliates 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of the bankruptcy cases 
risks related to our real estate operations revenues for our real estate operations are expected to decline for the foreseeable future 
in  our real estate operations realized substantial revenues related to sales of residential lots and acreage at our fountain hills  mirada and palmas developments 
as the proceeds from these asset sales have not been redeployed to other real estate assets and there have been significant declines in real estate demand in areas where the company operates  this level of sales activity is not expected to recur for the foreseeable future 
real estate development is a cyclical industry and is affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including  but not limited to employment levels and population growth and shifts  interest rates and the availability of financing  consumer confidence  and changes in the desirability of residential and commercial areas 
development of a project begins  and financial and other resources are typically committed long before a real estate project is able to begin sales  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
our real estate operations are subject to various land use regulations and governmental approvals 
our real estate operations are subject to comprehensive federal  state and local statutes  ordinances and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
periodic approval is required from different agencies in connection with various matters 
certain jurisdictions also require the inspection of properties  approval of sales literature  disclosure to purchasers of specific information  bonding for property improvements  and approval of real estate contract forms 
failure to comply with such regulations and requirements to obtain any such approvals could adversely affect our real estate operations 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals  which would result in additional costs and delays in obtaining approvals or bringing a development to market  and could result in litigation outcomes unfavorable to us in a variety of ways such as affecting the timing  design  completion  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are in competition with other developments for customers and residents 
there is intense competition among companies in the real estate investment and development business 
our palmas acreage sales and resort operations compete with similar businesses in the caribbean  florida and other vacation holiday destinations  and our developments and operations in arizona face increased competition in the area 
our mirada development faces competition from both existing and future developments  many with golf courses and other amenities 
claims relating to infrastructure obligations could be filed against our real estate operations 
our real estate operations rely on third party contractors to complete various contractual infrastructure requirements at our real estate developments  such as installing electrical lines  piping  water tanks  drainage and roads 
the failure of the contractors to perform or their faulty workmanship could result in claims against our real estate operations 
risks related to our racing operations the significant competition we face from other gaming and entertainment operations can be expected to continue adversely affecting the racing segment s operating performance 
sam houston race park competes with many other forms of wagering and entertainment  including louisiana gaming facilities  a nearby greyhound racetrack  the texas state lottery  bingo and a wide range of sporting events and other entertainment activities 
other competitive pressures include simulcast signals broadcast by race tracks able to offer larger purses and competitive fields  resorts with gaming  and increasing use of the internet for horse wagering and gaming  including internet betting services with customer incentives such as cash rebates 
future risks include approval of new forms of gaming in texas or elsewhere 
our racing operations are also affected by the allocation of sufficient live racing days by the racing commission and their ability to attract a sufficient number and quality of race horses and greyhounds 
sam houston race park and valley race park face a substantial challenge to maintain and grow their customer base in light of these competitive pressures 
it will be difficult to obtain legislation that would allow our racing operations to increase their revenues 
our two racing facilities would be able to increase their revenues  likely to a substantial degree  were additional forms of gaming to be allowed at our existing horse and dog racing tracks 
the company and other industry participants have during prior regular and special sessions of the texas legislature pursued legislation that would permit video lottery terminals at texas tracks 
none of these sessions resulted in the passage of such legislation 
while we intend to continue vigorously pursuing legislation favorable to our racing operations  no assurances can be given that it will be enacted or become effective as some legislation may require the approval of two thirds of each legislative house and a majority of texas voters 
moreover  it is impossible to determine what the provisions of any such legislation would be or its ultimate effect on our racing operations 
other risk factors claims could arise from prior acquisitions 
the company or its affiliates have over time acquired a variety of properties or entities  some with long operating histories 
these properties and entities may be subject to environmental or other liabilities that were not identified at the time of acquisition 
any such claims would likely be costly to defend and their settlement or other resolution could potentially have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operation or liquidity 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events could adversely affect various operations of the company 
our operations are subject to risks from natural disasters and other catastrophic events 
for instance  our palmas resort in puerto rico  as well as our racing operations at sam houston race park and valley race park  are particularly subject to damage from hurricanes 
our mirada development is particularly subject to the risk of earthquakes 
moreover  all of our operations are subject to general risks such as fire or adverse weather conditions 
uninsured claims and litigation could adversely impact our operating results 
we have insurance coverage against a variety of operating hazards including business interruption  liability and other losses to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available at acceptable rates  but the nature and amount of that insurance may not be sufficient to fully cover liabilities arising out of pending and future litigation or other claims 
this insurance has deductibles or self insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions 
insurance does not provide complete protection against losses and risks  and our results of operations would be adversely affected by claims not covered by insurance 
we depend on our management and employees 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience  efforts and availability of our management and employees 
the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with critical skills or the unionization of our workforce could have a negative effect on our business  financial conditions  results of operations or growth 
compliance with and changes in laws and regulations and risks from legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results 
our operations can be affected by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate 
changes that could affect the legal environment include new legislation  new regulations  new policies  legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing rules and regulations 
changes that affect the business environment include changes in accounting standards  changes in environmental laws  changes in tax rates or tax laws that could have a variety of financial and other effects  including  by way of example  the ability to fully utilize our tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
maxxam parent s investment portfolio could be adversely affected by market conditions and other factors 
maxxam parent has substantial assets in different types of investments such as a variety of liquid money market instruments  us equity securities and corporate debt securities  us treasury obligations and other debt securities  and equity interests in several limited partnerships which invest in diversified portfolios of common stocks and equity securities  and exchange traded options  futures  forward foregoing currency contracts  and other arbitrage opportunities 
while maxxam parent tries to minimize its risk with respect to its investment portfolio  there can be no assurance that a variety of market and other factors  such as interest rate changes and general market fluctuations  will not adversely affect the performance of maxxam parent s investment portfolio 
our chairman controls the election of the company s board of directors 
charles e 
hurwitz  the company s chairman of the board  controls a majority of the company s common stock the common stock and of the company s total combined voting power 
as a result  mr

h 
in november  the respondents filed an amended counterclaim and an amended motion for sanctions collectively  the sanctions motion

the district court s award was divided into various components consisting of the costs  and interest  incurred by the respondents in connection with the ots action approximately million  the fdic action approximately million  and certain ancillary proceedings approximately million 
the fdic subsequently appealed the district court s decision to the us fifth circuit court of appeals 
on april   the fifth circuit issued its decision with respect to the fdic s appeal 
while the circuit court reversed the district court s award of sanctions in respect of the ots action  it upheld the district court s finding of sanctionable conduct by the fdic in connection with the fdic action and the ancillary proceedings 
the circuit court returned the case to the district court for further proceedings regarding the proper amount of sanctions in respect of the fdic action and the ancillary proceedings  such amount to be based upon that portion of the respondents costs that resulted from the harassing  delaying and other improper tactics of the fdic up to million

the bankruptcy cases are being jointly administered  with the debtors managing their businesses in the ordinary course as debtors in possession subject to the control and supervision of the bankruptcy court 
the filing of the bankruptcy cases was precipitated by liquidity shortfalls at palco and scopac and their resultant inability to make january interest payments on their respective debt obligations arising from regulatory restrictions and limitations on timber harvest  increased timber harvesting costs and depressed lumber prices

critical accounting policies and estimates this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see item business general  item a 
risk factors  and below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates due to changed facts  circumstances and conditions 
the following accounting policies and resulting estimates are considered critical in light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on the company s reported financial information 
principles of consolidation under generally accepted accounting principles for entities consolidated through voting interests  consolidation is generally required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these rules  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
principles of consolidation deconsolidation of palco and its subsidiaries under generally accepted accounting principles for entities consolidated through voting interests  consolidation is generally required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these principles  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
as discussed in note  potential impact on registrant and certain related entities on january   palco and its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  the company deconsolidated palco s financial results beginning january   and began reporting its investment in palco using the cost method 
through january   under generally accepted principles of consolidation  the company had recognized losses in excess of its investment in palco of million 
since palco s results are no longer consolidated  any adjustments reflected in palco s financial statements subsequent to january  relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities or the effects on existing stockholders deficit  as well as adjustments made to palco s financial information for loss contingencies and other matters are not expected to affect the company s financial results 
accordingly  these consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments related to the deconsolidation of palco other than presenting the company s investment in palco using the cost method  which reflects the investment as a single amount on its balance sheet  and discontinuing the recording of earnings or losses from palco after january  the company expects to consider reversal of these losses when either palco s bankruptcy is resolved and the amount of the company s remaining investment in palco is determined or the company disposes of its investment in palco 
when either of the events described above occurs  the company will re evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment of its investment in palco based upon the facts and circumstances at such time 
available for sale securities the company invests its idle cash in various investment funds  each having an underlying investment strategy  an external investment manager and a portfolio of investment securities 
the company does not actively manage its investments with the intent of profiting from short term moves in price differences 
the company generally invests in individual funds for an extended period of time  unless the overall performance of the investment fund is below internal expectations for an extended period of time 
the company does not engage in daily trading activities 
management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are stated at fair market value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in investment and interest income 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are also included in investment and interest income 
the cost of securities sold is determined using the first in  first out method 
the fair value of substantially all securities is determined by quoted market prices 
the fair value of marketable debt securities includes accrued interest 
investments are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are recognized 
the company uses the best available information such as market quotes and external information to determine fair value 
to determine whether declines in value are other than temporary  the company looks to specific factors such as the liquidity position of the particular investment  recent sales activity of similar investments and also assesses aggregate market positions 
investments in limited partnerships the company accounts for its noncontrolling interests in its investment limited partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  the company records its share of partnership earnings or losses in its consolidated statements of operations as opposed to accumulated other comprehensive income as is done for available for sale securities 
investments are evaluated for impairment at the end of each reporting period and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are recognized 
the company uses the best available information such as market quotes and external information to determine fair value 
to determine whether declines in value are other than temporary  the company looks to specific factors such as the liquidity position of the particular investment  recent sales activity of similar investments and also assesses aggregate market positions 
gain and loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and other proceedings  including those discussed in note such matters involve uncertainty as to reasonably possible losses and potential gains the company may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to income estimated losses including related estimated legal fees from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company recognizes gain contingencies when they are realized 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of gains and losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative and regulatory developments  and other factors 
for larger environmental matters  the company estimates the losses using estimates prepared by third party experts and the advice of internal and external counsel 
risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome of litigation and environmental contingencies 
see note for further discussion of the company s material contingencies 
income taxes the company accrues and charges to income estimated taxes when it is probable at the balance sheet date that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  including situations in which the company has and has not received tax assessments from the relevant taxing authority 
the company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that will more likely than not be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
see note for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company has prepaid or for which it will receive a tax benefit an asset or will have to pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that result from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibility between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code 
accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
the need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity of the determination 
projections of future taxable income  by their very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  although they might conceivably be predictable  are far less certain than events that have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of the company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note for further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses estimating future benefit payments for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations requires the company to make a number of assumptions about future experience 
these assumptions are combined with the terms of the company s plans to produce an estimate of required future benefit payments  which is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as a result  assumptions about the covered population demographic assumptions and about the economic environment economic assumptions significantly affect pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the most significant demographic assumptions are expected retirement age  life expectancy  and turnover  while the key economic assumptions are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
at december   the company s pension plans were frozen 
as a result  these plans will continue  but no additional benefits will accrue to participants subsequent to december  future benefit payments will continue to be measured based on the same types of demographic and economic assumptions  with the exception of salary growth as no new benefits will be accrued 
the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the company s other postretirement benefit plans was determined using a discount rate of at december   and at december  as the pension plans were frozen december   there is no assumed weighted average long term rate of compensation 
the assumed weighted average long term rate of return on the assets of the plans is 
the assets of the plans consist principally of common stocks and us government and other fixed income obligations 
the estimated impact of a decrease in the discount rate from to would increase the company s consolidated projected pension benefit obligation by approximately million  while the estimated impact of a increase in the discount rate from to would decrease the company s consolidated projected pension benefit obligation by approximately million 
see note for further discussion of the consolidated obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company reviews noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated if the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets  including the possible residual value associated with their eventual disposition  are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upon impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down for impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the need for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
in some instances  situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes in economic conditions or other factors that develop over time  which increases the subjectivity of the assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
a probability weighted approach is used for situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows
