item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was a challenging year on many fronts 
the fiscal year began with our august acquisitions of decima and marketshare and positive organic revenue through the first five months 
subsequently  our performance was adversely impacted by deteriorating macro economic conditions in north america which caused declines in our bookings that led to revenue in the us and canada that fell below our expectations  spending freezes and cuts in the sectors of the pharmaceutical industry in which our business was concentrated  which required us to reposition our strategies  sales efforts and management  and decreased profitability driven by the revenue decline noted above  as we were unable to adjust our expenses quickly enough to align with our decreased revenue 
in response to the above  we took the following actions restructured the company to better align our direct cost structure with expected revenue  as described in more detail under restructuring  replaced our us healthcare sales and business leadership  retained a performance improvement consulting firm to assist us  and continued our ongoing efforts to maximize the productivity of our professional staff and appropriately scale our selling  general and administrative costs to the expected needs of our business 
in addition to the restructuring charges noted above  we incurred million in legal  accounting  banking and other costs in connection with a decision by our board of directors to investigate strategic alternatives available to the company 
after retaining an investment bank to assist with this process and considering the results of the investigations  the board determined that it was in the best interest of our stockholders to discontinue the process and to focus the company s attention on operational improvement and growth 
we have retained a performance improvement consulting firm to assist us in those efforts 

table of contents fiscal ended with mixed results  specifically declines in revenue  operating margin and net income when compared with fiscal  the causes of which are more fully described under results of operations  growth in european internet revenue when compared with fiscal  more fully described under results of operations  expanded global presence provided by our mediatransfer  decima and marketshare acquisitions  continued generation of cash from our operations  which has allowed us to continue to pay down our outstanding debt  a pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment charge of million based on our annual goodwill impairment evaluation  performed in accordance with sfas no 
 which indicated that the fair value of the company was less than the carrying value of our net assets at june  while fiscal had a number of challenges  we believe that the actions we took during the fiscal year will position us for revenue and profit growth in fiscal and beyond

 business combinations 
further financial information about business combinations is included in note  business combinations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
goodwill impairment charge at june   we performed the initial step of our impairment evaluation by comparing the fair market value of our single reporting unit  as determined using a discounted cash flow model  to its carrying value 
as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  we performed the second step of our impairment evaluation to calculate impairment and as a result  recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million 
the primary reason for the impairment charge was the sustained decline of our stock price during the second half of fiscal at march   we considered the decline in our stock price from january to march at that time  we concluded that the decline was short term in nature and did not trigger a review for impairment outside of our annual june impairment evaluation date 
at june  and  based upon our annual evaluations  we determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount  resulting in no impairment 
restructuring fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took certain actions designed to align the cost structure of our uk operations with the evolving operational needs of that business 
specifically  we reduced headcount at our uk facilities by full time employees and incurred in one time termination benefits  all of which will involve cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees in june all actions were completed by july  and we expect that the related cash payments will be completed by september the uk restructuring described above follows separate actions we took at various times during the fourth quarter of fiscal to strategically reduce headcount at several of our us facilities by a total of full time equivalents  as a result of which we incurred million in one time termination benefits  all of which involved cash payments

we incurred million in contract termination charges related to the remaining operating lease obligation  all of which involved cash payments 
all actions associated with these headcount and leased space reductions were completed in april and may  respectively  and we expect that the related cash payments will be completed by october and april  respectively 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to our decisions made at various times during the quarter to close our telephone center in orem  utah by march  strategically reduce headcount  and reduce leased space at our grandville  michigan and norwalk  connecticut offices 
each decision was designed to better align our cost structure with the evolving operational needs of the business 
in connection with the orem closure  we reduced our headcount by full time equivalents and incurred million in one time termination benefits

all actions associated with the space reductions were completed in march cash payments in connection with the remaining lease obligations will be completed by april as a result of the actions described above  we realized approximately million in cash savings during fiscal and expect to realize approximately million in cash savings during fiscal fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to a facilities consolidation and headcount reduction  both designed to ensure the alignment of our cost structure with the operational needs of the business 
we negotiated an amendment to the lease agreement for our reston  virginia office  terminating our lease with respect to a portion of our space in exchange for a payment of million to the landlord  subject to conditions which have since been met 
as a result of the amendment  our lease obligation over the remaining term of the lease was reduced by approximately million from the initial lease  which when offset against the payment to the landlord for the space reduction noted above  will result in anticipated net savings of approximately million over the remaining lease term 
we also reduced the staff of our us operations by full time equivalents and incurred million in severance charges  all of which involved cash payments 
the reduction in staff was communicated to the affected employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal all actions in the plan were completed by june  cash payments in connection with the plan were completed in december as a result of the actions described above  we realized cash savings of approximately million in fiscal  consistent with our savings expectation at the time that these actions were taken 
fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges directly related to certain actions designed to align the cost structure of our uk operations with the operational needs of that business 
management developed a formal plan that included closing two facilities in macclesfield and stockport and consolidating those operations into our hazel grove location 
this consolidation was completed by june  at a cost of less than million  the majority of which represented future cash payments on the remaining lease commitment for the macclesfield facility 
additionally  we classified the stockport facility and the related property  plant and equipment as assets held for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to a plan to sell our rent and recruit business 
based upon our review and assessment of rent and recruit s net assets  the book values of its remaining net assets approximated their estimated fair value 
we classified rent and recruit as a discontinued operation  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
at june   we were in the process of identifying potential buyers or other interested parties and discussing a possible transaction with them 
on august   the sale of rent and recruit was completed 
the results of operations  net of taxes  and the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of rent and recruit are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations  assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale  respectively

further financial information regarding discontinued operations is included in note  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of our financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  
table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  hipoints loyalty program  and contingencies and other accruals 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from services on a proportional performance basis 
in assessing contract performance  both input and output criteria are reviewed 
costs incurred are used as an objective input measure of performance 
the primary input of all work performed under these arrangements is labor 
as a result of the relationship between labor and cost  there is normally a direct relationship between the costs incurred and the proportion of the contract performed to date 
costs incurred as an initial proportion of expected total costs is used as an initial proportional performance measure 
this indicative proportional performance measure is always subsequently validated against more subjective criteria ie relevant output measures such as the percentage of interviews completed  percentage of reports delivered to a client and the achievement of any project milestones stipulated in the contract 
in the event of divergence between the objective and more subjective measures  the more subjective measures take precedence since these are output measures 
clients are obligated to pay based upon services performed  and in the event that a client cancels the contract  the client is responsible for payment for services performed through the date of cancellation 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon as it becomes probable that such losses will occur 
invoices to clients in the ordinary course are generated based upon the achievement of specific events  as defined by each contract  including deliverables  timetables  and incurrence of certain costs 
such events may not be directly related to the performance of services 
revenues earned on contracts in progress in excess of billings are classified as unbilled receivables 
amounts billed in excess of revenues earned are classified as deferred revenue 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of our operations 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and to write down goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets when impaired 
the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 
these assessments require us to estimate the fair market value of our reporting unit 
if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  absent other facts to the contrary  we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of the reporting unit against earnings in our consolidated financial statements 
as we have one reportable segment  we utilize the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  
table of contents significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting unit and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting this valuation  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two step process as prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a second step must be followed to calculate impairment 
otherwise  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill is not considered to be impaired as of the measurement date 
to determine fair value for our reporting unit  we use the fair value of the cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and affect the recorded balance of goodwill 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results and the balance of goodwill in the future could be affected by impairment charges 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to operating loss carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases for operating profit and tax liability carryforward 
sfas no 
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of the available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
on july   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for 
table of contents income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees based on the fair value of the share based payment on the date of grant 
we elected to use the modified prospective approach for adoption  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at july  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
for share based payments granted subsequent to july   compensation expense based on the grant date fair value is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which employs the following assumptions expected volatility based on historical volatilities from daily share price observations for our stock covering a period commensurate with the expected term of the options granted 
expected life of the option based on the vesting terms of the respective option and a contractual life of ten years  calculated using the simplified method as allowed by staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
risk free rate based on the implied yield available at the time the options were granted on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option when granted 
dividend yield based on our historical practice of electing not to pay dividends to our shareholders 
expected volatility and the expected life of the options granted  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes option pricing model  involve management s best estimates at that time 
the weighted average assumptions used to value options during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  are set forth in note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
the fair value of our restricted stock awards is based on the price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
we grant options to purchase our stock at fair value as of the date of grant 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or restricted shares that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee termination behavior and the vesting period of the respective stock options or restricted shares 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
hipoints loyalty program in july  we initiated hipoints  a loyalty program designed to reward respondents who register for our online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points are non transferable and may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration 
we maintain a reserve for our obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is based on our actual redemption rates since the inception of the program 
an actual redemption rate that differs from the expected redemption rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents prior to december  points under the hipoints program expired after one year of account inactivity 
in december  we modified the expiration parameters of the program such that points now expire after nine months of account inactivity and tightened the rules around expirations to more accurately account for panelists that are not truly engaged in the program 
these changes resulted in an approximately million reduction in our reserve for obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points during the three months ended december   which was recorded in the cost of services line item of our consolidated statement of operations 
contingencies and other accruals from time to time  we record accruals for severance costs both in connection with formal restructuring programs and in the normal course  lease costs associated with excess facilities  contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 
additionally  we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year 
amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not finally determinable until the completion of our fiscal year end closing process

us revenue decreased by million to million for fiscal  a decrease of over fiscal this decrease in us revenue was principally driven by revenue declines in the following research groups healthcare  as a result of internal restructuring at certain of this group s clients  as well as certain industry challenges  including continued consolidation and realignment within the healthcare industry  technology and telecom  as a result of sales force turnover within this group  which necessitated the rebuilding of the group s sales team throughout fiscal  and loyalty  as a result of our decision at the end of fiscal not to bid on a significant  recurring client tracking study because of its low profit margins  offset in part by winning a new tracking study at an existing client and reformulating the group s service offerings to better meet customer requirements 
offsetting the decrease in us revenue as noted above were revenue increases in the following research groups marketing and communications research  as a result of winning new tracking studies with new and existing clients  public affairs and policy  as a result of realigning this group s sales resources with the objectives of its business  and emerging and general markets  as a result of consistent efforts on the part of this group s sales resources to grow its client base 
european revenue increased by million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal european revenue increased primarily due to a favorable impact of million as a result of foreign exchange rate differences and the depreciation of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro  our acquisition of mediatransfer in april  which contributed million in revenue during the fourth fiscal quarter  and our concerted efforts toward stabilizing and growing our european operations

the growth in european internet based revenue for fiscal was the result of our focus on training our european sales force on promoting the benefits of internet based data collection to their clients  and our april acquisition of mediatransfer  which contributed million in internet based revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of services 
cost of services increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal cost of services was principally impacted by increased utilization rates for professional staff during fiscal when compared with fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense was principally the result of our investments to expand our us sales force and to hire and train a dedicated european sales force during fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal general and administrative expense was principally impacted by several factors  including the following a million decrease in bonus expense  as a result of our performance falling short of bonus plan targets  million in general and administrative expenses as a result of our april acquisition of mediatransfer  a million increase in stock based compensation expense for options and restricted stock granted during fiscal  million in costs associated with an unsuccessful acquisition during the third fiscal quarter  and million in administration fees for the repurchase program  compared with less than million in such fees during fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was the result of fixed and intangible assets that became fully depreciated or amortized during fiscal restructuring charges 
see above under restructuring for further discussion of restructuring charges incurred during fiscal and gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets during fiscal consisted of a million gain realized on the december sale of our stockport facility  along with million in net proceeds from the june sale of two internally developed patents 
no similar gains were realized during fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income was million or of total revenue for fiscal  compared with million or of total revenue for fiscal the increase in interest and other income was primarily due to favorable rates of return compared with those for fiscal interest expense

income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate was principally due to valuation allowance reversals  as more fully described in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
significant factors affecting company performance our revenue mix and gross profitability we treat all of the revenue from a project as internet based whenever more than of the data collection for that project was completed online 
regardless of data collection mode  most full service market research projects contain three specific phases survey design  data collection  and data reporting and analysis 
generally  the costs of a project are spread evenly across those three phases 
internet based data collection has certain fixed costs relating to data collection  panel incentives and database development and maintenance 
when the volume of internet based work reaches the point where fixed costs are absorbed  increases in internet based revenue tend to increase profitability  assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses are properly controlled 
projects designated as internet based may have traditional data collection components  particularly in multi country studies where internet databases are not fully developed 
that traditional data collection component tends to decrease the profitability of the project 
profitability is also decreased by direct costs of outsourcing programming and telephone data collection and incentive pass through costs 
for further information regarding internet based revenue  by quarter  for the fiscal years ended june  and  please see the table in our ability to measure our performance below 
our ability to measure our performance we closely track certain key operating metrics  specifically bookings  ending sales backlog  average billable full time equivalents  days of sales outstanding  utilization and bookings to revenue ratio 
each of these key operating metrics enables us to measure the current and forecasted performance of our business relative to historical trends and promote a management culture that focuses on accountability 
we believe that this ultimately leads to increased productivity and more effective and efficient use of our human and capital resources

to help that process  we provide trailing twelve month key operating metrics 
trailing twelve month data for certain of our key operating metrics for continuing operations at june   and at the last eight fiscal quarter end dates  were as follows us dollar amounts in millions sep dec mar jun sep dec mar jun consolidated revenue internet revenue of total revenue north american internet revenue of na revenue european internet revenue of european revenue bookings average billable full time equivalents ftes utilization bookings to revenue ratio additional information regarding each of the key operating metrics noted above is as follows bookings are defined as the contract value of revenue generating projects that are anticipated to take place during the next four fiscal quarters for which a firm client commitment was received during the current period  less any adjustments to prior period bookings due to contract value adjustments or project cancellations during the current period 
bookings for the three months ended june  were million  compared with million for the same prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to incremental bookings as a result of our decima and marketshare acquisitions  combined with growth from an existing client tracking study within our financial services group 

table of contents monitoring bookings enhances our ability to forecast long term revenue and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
however  we also are mindful that bookings often vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
information concerning our new bookings is not comparable to  nor should it be substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new bookings involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals  extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
ending sales backlog is defined as prior period ending sales backlog plus current period bookings  less revenue recognized on outstanding projects as of the end of the period 
ending sales backlog helps us to manage our future staffing levels more accurately and is also an indicator of the effectiveness of our marketing and sales initiatives 
generally  projects included in ending sales backlog at the end of a fiscal period convert to revenue from services during the following twelve months  based on our experience from prior years 
ending sales backlog of million for the three months ended june   compared with million for the same prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to incremental backlog as a result of our decima and marketshare acquisitions 
average billable full time equivalents fte s are defined as the hours of available billable capacity in a given period divided by total standard hours for a full time employee and represent an average for the periods reported 
average billable fte s excludes the impact of work performed by third party  offshore labor 
measuring fte s enables us to determine proper staffing levels  minimize unbillable time and improve utilization and profitability 
average billable fte s of for the three months ended june   compared with average billable fte s reported for the same prior year period 
the increase in average billable ftes when compared with the same prior year period is primarily due to the increase over the same prior year period in revenue from services 
the impact of the cost reduction actions described above had minimal impact on average billable fte s during the fourth fiscal quarter  as those actions were taken during the last half of the quarter 
days of sales outstanding dso is calculated as accounts receivable as of the end of the applicable period including unbilled receivables less deferred revenue divided by our daily revenue total revenue for the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period 
measuring dso allows us to minimize our investment in working capital  measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts and helps forecast cash flow 
dso of days for the three months ended june   consistent with dso for the same prior year period 
utilization is defined as hours billed by project personnel in connection with specific revenue generating projects divided by total hours of available capacity 
hours billed do not include marketing  selling or proposal generation time 
tracking utilization enables efficient management of overall staffing levels and promotes greater accountability for the management of resources on individual projects 
utilization for the three months ended june  was  essentially flat when compared with for the same prior year period

net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of the cash contributed from the operations of mediatransfer  decima and marketshare 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to timing differences compared with the prior fiscal year in payment of outstanding accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  which were offset by an improvement in the timeliness of collecting amounts due on outstanding invoices  as noted by a million decrease in accounts receivable and a million increase in cash collected on amounts billed in excess of costs deferred revenue 
net cash used in provided by investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million in net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal this change is principally the result of million in net cash paid in connection with our decima and marketshare acquisitions  offset by million in net cash generated from maturities and sales of marketable securities during fiscal net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million used in investing activities for fiscal the change from fiscal was principally due to our liquidation of marketable securities to fund repurchases of our common stock under our repurchase program  described in further detail below  offset by our ongoing investing activities  including our acquisition of mediatransfer in april for million net of cash acquired 
net cash used in financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million used in financing activities for fiscal this change is the result of million in net proceeds from borrowings  which were used to fund a portion of the consideration for our acquisitions of decima and marketshare  offset by million in payments on outstanding borrowings 
comparatively  million was used during fiscal to fund repurchases of our common stock under our share repurchase program discussed below 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the increase in net cash used in financing activities was principally due to our use of million in cash to repurchase shares of our common stock under our repurchase program during fiscal  offset by million in cash proceeds from short term borrowings used to fund our acquisition of mediatransfer and share repurchases under our repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal working capital at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  essentially flat when compared with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at june   as a result of the reasons described above 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy the 
table of contents cash requirements that we anticipate will be necessary to support our planned operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate 
in addition  if we acquire additional businesses  we likely will be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
based upon our current relationships with financial institutions and financial condition  we believe that adequate funds will be available to support our acquisition activities on reasonable terms  but if such funds are not available when needed or on favorable terms  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of new products and services  our internet infrastructure and internet panel  the marketing and selling of our services and our acquisition activities 
for the fiscal year ending june   our capital expenditures are expected to range between and million 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and the cash we held at june  will be sufficient to provide adequate funding for any foreseeable capital requirements that may arise 
in order to continue to generate revenue  we must continually develop new business  both for growth and to replace completed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of our revenue  we have had to find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as client relationships and work for continuing clients change and will likely have to continue to do so in the future 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of our business plan  but also on general market factors outside of our control 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as a result  as economic conditions decline in any of our markets  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted 
share repurchase program pursuant to the repurchase program authorized by our board on may   as amended on january and may   we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of million 
all repurchased shares were subsequently retired 
the repurchase program expired on december  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the repurchase program during the fiscal year ended june  credit facilities on september   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan  as administrative agent  and the lenders party thereto 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the lenders made available million in credit facilities the credit facilities in the form of a revolving line of credit revolving line  a term loan term loan  and a multiple advance term loan commitment multiple advance commitment 
the revolving line enables us to borrow  repay  and re borrow up to million principal outstanding at any one time  with a million sub limit for issuance of letters of credit 
the full amount of the term loan term loan a was made in a single advance of million at the time of closing of the credit facilities 
the multiple advance commitment enables us to borrow up to an aggregate of million in one or more advances  and million term loan b and million term loan c were advanced at closing 
existing letters of credit in the face amount of million also were treated as if issued under the revolving line 
in addition  the credit agreement permits us to request increases in the revolving line up to an additional million of availability  subject to discretionary commitments by the then lenders and  if needed  additional lenders 
the credit facilities replaced existing credit arrangements with jpmorgan

the required principal repayments of term loans a  b and c for each of the five succeeding fiscal years are set forth in note  borrowings  to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form k

at june   the applicable libor interest rate was 
effective september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with jpmorgan  which effectively fixed the floating libor interest rates on the amounts outstanding under term loans a  b and c at through september  the additional spread applicable to the interest rates based on the our leverage ratio at june  was  resulting in an aggregate interest rate based on that leverage ratio of 
we anticipate that the interest rate swap will be settled upon maturity and it is being accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value each reporting period with the changes in the fair value of the hedge that take place through the date of maturity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at june   we recorded a liability of million in the other liabilities line item of our consolidated balance sheet 
there was no ineffectiveness associated with the interest rate swap for the fiscal year ended june  the credit agreement contains customary representations  default provisions  and affirmative and negative covenants  including among others prohibitions of dividends  sales of certain assets and mergers  and restrictions related to acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  investments  share repurchases and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to  and a consolidated leverage ratio of to or less

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have two kinds of market risk exposures  interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure 
we have no market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes 
as we continue to increase our debt and expand globally  the risk of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
we will continue to assess the need to  and will as appropriate  utilize interest rate swaps and financial instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis to mitigate such risks 
interest rate exposure at june   we had outstanding debt under our credit facilities of million 
the debt matures september  and bears interest at the floating adjusted libor plus an applicable margin 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which fixed the floating adjusted libor portion of the interest rate at through september  the additional applicable margin is adjusted quarterly based upon our leverage ratio 
using a sensitivity analysis based on a hypothetical increase in prevailing interest rates over a month period  each increase from prevailing interest rates at june  would have increased the fair value of the interest rate swap by million and each decrease from prevailing 
table of contents interest rates at june  would have decreased the fair value of the interest rate swap by million 
foreign currency exposure as a result of operating in foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have international sales and operations in europe  north america  and asia 
therefore  we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us transactions are denominated in the functional currencies of the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
our consolidated assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
consolidated income and expense items are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we measure our risk related to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact of operating results on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of their home country  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in our results of operations as a result of consolidating the results of our international operations  which are denominated in each country s functional currency  with our us results 
the impact of transaction gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries was not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating the results of our foreign subsidiaries with our us results  due to the size and profitability of our foreign operations in comparison to our consolidated operations 
however  if the size and operating profits of our international operations increase and we continue to expand globally  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
thus  we evaluate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk on an ongoing basis 
since our foreign operations are conducted using a foreign currency  we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in a foreign currency  given the amount and short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency  including cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the maturity of these instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at june  holding all other variables constant  we have determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
