table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses and visa litigation accounting to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount of loss in the loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and interpretation of current economic trends  uncertainties and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the credit quality discussion below 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statement  the company recognized a liability and corresponding expense of  thousand related to visa litigation 
the company is not a named party to any visa litigation 
the company s access to reliable information with which to estimate its liability is limited to relevant information communicated by visa to its member banks and other public information 
as a result  the company s ultimate liability regarding visa litigation could differ from the amount recorded at december  acquisition effective march   the company acquired redwood empire bancorp rebc  parent company of national bank of the redwoods 
the rebc acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations which requires valuing assets and liabilities which do not have quoted market prices 
in determining fair values for assets and liabilities without quoted market prices  management engaged an independent consultant to determine such fair values 
critical assumptions used in the valuation included prevailing market interest rates on similar financial products  future cash flows  maturity structures and durations of similar financial products  the cost of processing deposit products  the interest rate structure for similar funding sources over the estimated duration of acquired deposits  the duration of customer relationships  and other critical assumptions 
the acquisition of rebc was completed on march   followed by a divestiture of a former rebc branch in lake county in the second quarter of after adjusting for the divestiture the transaction was valued at approximately million  including approximately million paid in cash  issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock  and conversion of redwood empire stock options into company stock options based on an average stock price of 
rebc  on march   had approximately million in loans  million in deposits  million in trust preferred subordinated debt  and million of shareholders equity 
goodwill of million and identifiable intangibles of million were recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
during the second quarter of  the company sold a former rebc branch with approximately million in deposits  as required by the frb in connection with its approval of the rebc acquisition 
the premium on the sale of the branch was recorded as a reduction of goodwill associated with the purchase of rebc 
net income the company reported net income for of million or diluted earnings per share  compared with net income of million  or diluted earnings per share for the results included a million litigation expense for the bank s proportionate share of visa s litigation exposure for which visa s members are responsible 
management currently anticipates that the company s proportional share of the proceeds of the planned initial public offering by visa will more than offset any liabilities related to visa litigation 
the period also included thousand in company owned life insurance proceeds and a thousand income tax refund  derived from an amended tax return  which reduced income tax expense 
the expense for visa litigation  insurance proceeds and the income tax refund combined to increase net income by thousand  or diluted earnings per share by components of net income year ended december  in thousands except per share amounts net interest and fee income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense taxes net income net income per average fully diluted share net income as a percentage of average shareholders equity net income as a percentage of average total assets fully taxable equivalent fte adjusted to adopt financial accounting standard revised  share based payment

credit quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk and to maintain broad diversification within the loan portfolio 
loan reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection

yields on these cash payments were and  respectively  for the year ended december   december  and december  cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared with thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is sound  however  nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period 
the performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment  economic conditions or factors particular to the borrower 
no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in the future 
allowance for credit losses the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired loans whose full collectibility is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified credit balances identified through an independent internal credit review process are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard loss rates 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
last  allocations are made to non criticized and classified commercial loans and residential real estate loans based on historical loss rates  and other statistical data 
the remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated 
the unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance 
it addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with management s analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio  which are related to the risks of the company s general lending activity 
included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have yet been recognized in past loan charge off history external factors 
the external factors evaluated by the company include economic and business conditions  external competitive issues  and other factors 
also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the company s loan portfolio and credit administration internal factors 
the internal factors evaluated by the company include loan review system  adequacy of lending management and staff  loan policies and procedures  problem loan trends  concentrations of credit  and other factors 
by their nature  these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify with a specific number 
management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on management s judgment as to the level of risk  and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance 
management considers the million allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of december

the increase in allocation to real estate construction loans reflects an increase in criticized construction loans outstanding  which receive higher allocations due to higher risk attributes  offset in part by lower volumes of non criticized construction loans and construction loan commitments 
the reduced allocations for residential real estate loans reflects refinements to the statistical model used to apply historical loss rates to loan volumes 
the increased allocation for consumer loans reflects higher delinquencies in automobile loans 
the allocation to loan portfolio segments changed from december  to december  the decline in allocation for commercial loans was primarily due to a decline in classified and other commercial loan balances 
the increase in allocation for real estate construction loans was due to an increase in construction loan commitments

table of contents impaired loans the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for credit risk 
in assessing impairment  the company reviews all nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of thousand 
nonaccrual commercial and construction loans with outstanding principal balances less than thousand  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the following summarizes the company s recorded investment in impaired loans for the dates indicated impaired loans at december  dollars in thousands total impaired loans specific reserves at december  and  the company measured impairment using the fair value of loan collateral 
the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was thousand compared with thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
all impaired loans are on nonaccrual status 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk results from many factors 
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts 
the remaining cash flow of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  deposit flows and other sources of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts  official check fees and correspondent bank service charges 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company s interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
management assesses interest rate risk by comparing the company s most likely earnings plan with various earnings models using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes  the degree of change over time  the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve 
for example  assuming a decrease of bp in the federal funds rate and a decrease of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  earnings are estimated to improve over the company s most likely net income plan for conversely  assuming an increase of bp in the federal funds rate and an increase of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  estimated earnings at risk would be approximately of the company s most likely net income plan for simulation estimates depend on  and will change with  the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
equity price risk can affect the company 
as an example  any preferred or common stock holdings  as permitted by banking regulations  can fluctuate in value 
declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary could result in loss recognition in the company s income statement 
fluctuations in the company s common stock price can impact the company s financial results in several ways 
first  the company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock  the market price paid to retire the company s common stock can affect the level of the company s cash flows and shares outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share 
second  the company s common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share 
third  fluctuations in the company s common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase company common stock to exercise such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding 
finally  the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the company s common stock price 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  are not significant in the normal course of the company s business activities 
during as the company reviewed its interest rate risk position to include the acquisition of rebc  in management s judgment  the company s interest rate risk exposure would be reduced through the sale of investment securities available for sale  with the proceeds from sale applied to reduce short term borrowed funds 
as a result  the company sold million of investment securities available for sale with a duration of years and book yield of at a realized loss of million

the growth of deposit balances is subject to heightened competition  the success of the company s sales efforts  delivery of superior customer service and market conditions 
a series of recent reductions in the federal funds rate have resulted in declining short term interest rates  which could impact deposit volumes in the future 
depending on economic conditions  interest rate levels  and a variety of other conditions  deposit growth may be used to fund loans  purchase investment securities or to reduce short term borrowings 
however  due to concerns regarding uncertainty in the general economic environment  competition  possible terrorist attacks and political uncertainty  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain
