overview the discussions below focus heavily on our three primary segments management operations  insurance underwriting operations and investment operations 
the segment basis financial results presented throughout management s discussion and analysis herein are those which management uses internally to monitor and evaluate results and are a supplemental presentation of our consolidated statements of operations 
economic and industrywide factors although we are primarily a management company  our earnings are driven largely by the management fee revenue we collect from the exchange that is based on the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the property casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the insurance industry experienced continued price softening in where significant price competition resulted in a decline in premiums but produced strong underwriting results 
am best s estimated industry combined ratio of in is a deterioration from the actual industry combined ratio of in the lack of significant catastrophe losses and favorable loss reserve development in contributed to industry underwriting profitability and further boosted the robust capital levels of insurers 
am best expects continued pressure on top line growth in the industry in and is projecting a slight premium decline for the property casualty industry 
the property and casualty group implemented significant rate reductions and other pricing actions in personal lines in resulting in a slight decline in direct written premiums for the property and casualty group 
we expect price stability in with only a minimal decrease of million in direct written premium from rating actions taken 
a period of declining premiums is especially challenging for us  as our revenues from management fees are dependent on growth in written premium  especially when the management fee rate is at its maximum rate of  which was the case in and will be in the credit environment turmoil caused by the subprime mortgage crisis has impacted the economy beginning in the second half of insurers tend not to have significant investment exposure to subprime mortgage backed securities partly due to restrictive state regulations 
according to am best  insurers that may be subject to significant impact from the subprime crisis may be those who write coverages where liability may exist such as professional liability and errors and omissions policies as a result of class action lawsuits related to subprime related issues 
we do not write directors and officers or errors and omissions coverages that would expose us to liability from subprime mortgage backed credits 
the majority of our fixed income portfolio is rated investment grade bbb or higher 
approximately of our fixed income portfolio is invested in structured mortgage backed products that have an average rating of a or higher 
we believe we have no direct exposure to the subprime residential mortgage market through investments in structured products 
similar to our portfolio  the exchange s fixed income portfolio is primarily rated investment grade 
approximately of the exchange s fixed income portfolio is invested in structured products with an average rating of aa 
in addition to the subprime credit crisis  we continue to monitor our municipal bond portfolio and the impact that credit rating downgrades of municipal bond insurers could have on our insured municipal bond portfolio 
the municipal bond portfolio accounts for million or of the total fixed maturity portfolio 
our municipal portfolio is highly rated and includes all investment grade holdings bbb or higher 
the overall insured credit quality of the municipal bond portfolio is rated aaa 
insurance enhanced municipal bonds total million  or of the municipal bond portfolio 
the overall credit quality of our municipal bond portfolio giving no effect to insurance is rated a 
our investment policy has always been to invest in municipal bond holdings based on underlying issuer ratings and believe municipal bond insurer downgrades would not have a material adverse affect on the valuation of our fixed maturity holdings 
during  we impaired million of securities primarily in the banking and finance industries 
included in the total impairment charge were million related to fixed maturities  million related to preferred stock and million in common stock 
similar to our increased level of impairments during  the exchange recognized impairment charges of million with million in bonds  million in preferred stock and million in common stock 
revenue generation we have three primary sources of revenue 
first  approximately of our revenues are generated by providing management services to the exchange 
the management fee is calculated as a percentage  not to exceed  of the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group 
the board of directors establishes the rate at least annually and considers such factors as relative financial strength of the exchange and company and projected revenue streams 
our board set the rate at  its maximum level 
second  we generate revenues from our property casualty insurance subsidiaries  which consist of our share of the pooled underwriting results of the property and casualty group 
all members of the property and casualty group pool their underwriting results 
under the pooling agreement  the exchange assumes of the property and casualty group s direct written premium 
through the pool  our subsidiaries  erie insurance company and erie insurance company of new york  currently assume of the property and casualty group s direct written premium  providing a direct incentive for us to manage the insurance underwriting discipline as effectively as possible 
finally  we generate revenues from our fixed maturity and equity investment portfolios  which provided nearly million in pre tax investment income during the portfolio is managed with a view toward maximizing after tax yields and limiting credit risk 
in addition  our portfolio of limited partnership investments generated nearly million in earnings before tax 
our results have allowed us to consistently generate high levels of cash flow from operations  which was million in our net cash flows from operations have been used to pay shareholder dividends and more recently to repurchase shares of our stock under our repurchase program 
opportunities  challenges and risks in order to grow our management fee revenue  our key challenges in continue to be profitable revenue growth in a time of heightened price competition 
containing the growth of expenses in our management operations is particularly important since it affects our gross margins from management operations and bears directly on property and casualty pricing  which is extremely competitive in soft markets 
expense management is further challenged by our need to enhance technology and improve ease of doing business for our agents and policyholders 
in  we increased penetration in our current territories through the appointment of new agencies 
during  we plan to continue this momentum by appointing another agencies 
in  we continued to develop the personal lines pricing plan  by introducing additional variables that further segment risks and allow us to be price competitive for the best risks 
the property and casualty group continues to evaluate potential new product offerings to meet consumer demands 
we plan to continue to control the growth in the cost of management operations by controlling salary and wage costs and other discretionary spending in however  we also intend to continue making targeted investments in technology to enhance customer service and ease of doing business with agents and customers  and improve productivity 
financial overview years ended december  change change over over in thousands  except per share data income from management operations underwriting income net revenue from investment operations income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net income per share diluted key points increase in net income per share diluted in impacted by improved underwriting operations and earnings from limited partnership investments

net revenue from investment operations was positively impacted by a increase in earnings from limited partnership investments in equity in earnings of limited partnerships increased to million in from million in management operations management fee revenue increased and in and  respectively 
the two determining factors of management fee revenue are the management fee rate we charge  and the direct written premiums of the property and casualty group

the cost of management operations increased  or million  to million in the increase in cost of management operations in was the result of commissions total commission costs increased  or million  to million in normal scheduled rate commissions remained flat during  while other agent incentives  including the first full year impact of the private passenger auto bonus  drove the increase in commissions 
total costs other than commissions all other non commission expense increased  to million in  driven by personnel and other operating costs 
personnel costs increased primarily due to a million charge related to the voluntary resignation of our former president and chief executive officer and higher average pay rates for our employees 
other operating costs increased due to a charge in the third quarter for a judgment against us of million as well as increased expenses for additional software costs and professional fees related to various corporate projects 
insurance underwriting operations contributing to the positive insurance underwriting operating result of an gaap combined ratio were the following factors lower pricing offset by improving severity trends resulted in a favorable accident year combined ratio  points  or million  of favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves in  and catastrophe losses totaling points in that were below expected results

william hirt estate of million 
net realized losses on investments totaled million in compared to realized gains of million primarily due to impairment charges of million offset by gains on sales of common stock of million 
equity in earnings of limited partnerships increased in as a result of fair value appreciation from private equity partnerships and fair value appreciation and earnings from our real estate limited partnerships 
the topics addressed in this overview are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 
critical accounting estimates in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually  and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings 
investment valuation we make estimates concerning the valuation of all investments 
we value fixed maturities and equity securities based on published market prices  except in rare cases where quoted market prices are not available 
investments are evaluated monthly for other than temporary impairment loss 
some factors considered in evaluating whether or not a decline in fair value is other than temporary include the extent and duration for which fair value is less than cost  historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer  short and long term prospects of the issuer and its industry based on analysts recommendations  specific events that occurred affecting the issuer  including rating downgrades  and our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value 
an investment deemed other than temporarily impaired is written down to its estimated fair value 
impairment charges are included as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the primary basis for the valuation of limited partnership interests are financial statements prepared by the general partner 
because of the timing of the preparation and delivery of these financial statements  the use of the most recently available financial statements provided by the general partners typically result in not less than a quarter delay in the inclusion of the limited partnership results in our consolidated statements of operations 
nearly all of the underlying investments in our limited partnerships are valued using a source other than quoted prices in active markets 
our limited partnership holdings are considered investment companies where the general partners record assets at fair value 
several factors are to be considered in determining whether an entity is an investment company 
among these factors are a large number of investors  low level of individual ownership and passive ownership that indicate the entity is an investment company 
we have three types of limited partnership investments private equity  mezzanine debt and real estate 
our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are diversified among various industries to minimize potential loss exposure 
the fair value amounts for our private equity and mezzanine debt partnerships are based on the financial statements of the general partners  who use various methods to estimate fair value including the market approach  income approach and or the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other pertinent information from market generated transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
such valuation techniques often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a single discounted present value amount 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
the cost approach is derived from the amount that is currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset 
if information becomes available that would impair the cost of these partnerships  then the general partner would generally adjust to the net realizable value 
real estate limited partnerships are recorded at fair value based on independent appraisals and or internal valuations 
real estate projects under development are generally valued at cost and impairment tested by the general partner 
we minimize the risk of market decline by avoiding concentration in a particular geographic area and are diversified across residential  commercial  industrial and retail real estate investments 
we perform various procedures in review of the general partners valuations  and while we rely on the general partners financial statements as the best available information to record our share of the partnership unrealized gains and losses resulting from valuation changes  we adjust our financial statements where appropriate 
as there is no ready market for these investments  they have the greatest potential for variability 
we survey each of the general partners about expected significant changes plus or minus compared to previous quarter to valuations prior to the release of the fund s quarterly and annual financial statements 
in the event of an expected significant change  the general partner will notify us and we will consider whether or not disclosure is warranted 
property casualty insurance liabilities reserves for property casualty insurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect our best estimate of future amounts needed to pay losses and related expenses with respect to insured events 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported 
they also include estimates of all future payments associated with processing and settling these claims 
reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims 
case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claims 
incurred but not reported reserves represent the difference between the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses and the estimated ultimate cost of all claims 
the process of estimating the liability for property casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is complex and involves a variety of actuarial techniques 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past development trends are an appropriate indicator of future events 
reserve estimates are based on our assessment of known facts and circumstances  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by internal factors  including changes in claims handling procedures and changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process  and external events  such as economic inflation  regulatory and legislative changes 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used  final loss settlements may vary significantly from the current estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
our actuaries review reserve estimates for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data  on a quarterly basis  for all direct reserves except the reserves for the pre automobile catastrophic injury liability that are reviewed semi annually 
these catastrophic injury reserves are reviewed semi annually because of the relatively low number of cases and the long term nature of these claims 
for reserves that are reviewed semi annually  our actuaries monitor the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters to either confirm that the estimate of ultimate losses should not change  or if necessary  perform a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change 
significant changes to the factors discussed above  which are either known or reasonably projected through analysis of internal and external data  are quantified in the reserve estimates each quarter 
the quarterly reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis 
the various methods generate different estimates of ultimate losses by product line and product coverage combination 
thus  there are no reserve ranges  but rather point estimates of the ultimate losses developed from the various methods 
the methods that are considered more credible vary by product coverage combination based primarily on the maturity of the accident quarter  the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the method 
paid loss development patterns  generated from historical data  are generally less useful for the more recent accident quarters of long tailed lines since a low percentage of ultimate losses are paid in early periods of development 
reported loss including cumulative paid losses and case reserves development patterns  generated from historical data  estimate only the unreported losses rather than the total unpaid losses as this technique is affected by changes in case reserving practices 
combinations of the paid and reported methods are used in developing estimated ultimate losses for short tail coverages  such as private passenger auto property and homeowners claims  and more mature accident quarters of long tail coverages  such as private passenger auto liability claims and commercial liability claims  including workers compensation 
the bornhuetter ferguson method combines a reported development technique with an expected loss ratio technique 
an expected loss ratio is developed through a review of historical loss ratios by accident quarter  as well as expected changes to earned premium  mix of business and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the accident quarter being evaluated 
this method is generally used on the first four to eight accident quarters on long tail coverages because a low percentage of losses are paid in the early period of development 
the reserve review process involves a comprehensive review by our actuaries of the various estimation methods and reserve levels produced by each 
these multiple reserve point estimates are reviewed by our reserving actuaries and reserve best estimates are selected 
the selected reserve estimates are discussed with management 
numerous factors are considered in setting reserve levels  including  but not limited to  the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications  the maturity of the accident year  pertinent claims frequency and severity trends observed over recent years  the level of volatility within a particular line of business and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to prior periods 
we also perform analyses to evaluate the adequacy of past reserve levels 
using subsequent information  we perform retrospective reserve analyses to test whether previously established estimates for reserves were reasonable 
our retrospective analysis indicated the property and casualty group s december  direct reserves had an estimated redundancy of approximately million  which was about of total reserves 
the property and casualty group s coverage with the greatest potential for variation are the catastrophic injury liability reserves 
workers compensation policies and the automobile no fault law in pennsylvania before provide for unlimited medical benefits 
the estimate of ultimate liabilities for these claims is subject to significant judgment due to variations in claimant health  mortality over time and health care cost trends 
because the coverage related to these claims is unique and the number of claims is less than  the previously discussed methods are not used  rather ultimate losses are estimated on a claim by claim basis 
an annual payment assumption is made for each of these claimants who sustained catastrophic injuries and then projected into the future based upon a particular assumption of the future inflation rate  including medical inflation and life expectancy of the claimant 
at december   the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for the pre automobile catastrophic injury liabilities  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million  which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty subsidiaries share of the net automobile catastrophic injury liability reserve is million at december  the most significant variable in estimating this liability is medical cost inflation 
our medical inflation rate assumption in setting this reserve for is for a annual increase grading down per year to an ultimate rate of 
each basis point change in the medical cost inflation assumption would result in a change in net liability for us of million 
in  we changed our mortality rate assumption to give weight to our own mortality experience and weight to a disabled pensioner mortality table 
prior to this  we used a mortality assumption based on our actual mortality experience only 
our actual mortality experience for disabled lives of catastrophically injured people is based on a relatively small number of lives 
we believe weighting the mortality assumption to incorporate the disabled pensioner mortality table  which has longer mortality than our experience  is reasonable in estimating our ultimate liability for these claims 
in  the workers compensation catastrophic injury claims were segregated from the total population of workers compensation claims and ultimate losses were developed on a claim by claim basis 
similar to the pre automobile catastrophic injury liability  these reserves are subject to significant judgment due to variations in claimant health  mortality over time and health care cost trends 
at december   the reserve carried by the property and casualty group for these workers compensation catastrophic injury reserves  which is our best estimate of this liability at this time  was million  which is net of million of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
our property casualty insurance subsidiaries share of the workers compensation catastrophic injury reserves is million at december  retirement benefit plans our pension plan for employees is the largest and only funded benefit plan we offer 
our pension and other retirement benefit obligations are developed from actuarial estimates in accordance with financial accounting standard fas  employers accounting for pensions 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets 
we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience  current market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  and expected future trends 
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments 
we discount those cash payments using the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense 
in determining the discount rate  we performed a bond matching study 
the study developed a portfolio of non callable bonds rated aa or better 
for some years  there were no bonds maturing 
in these instances  the study estimated the appropriate bond by assuming that there would be bonds available with the same characteristics as the available bond maturing in the immediately following year 
the cash flows from the bonds were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan  which have a duration of about years 
this bond matching study supported the selection of a discount rate for the pension expense 
the expense was based on a discount rate assumption of 
a change of basis points in the discount rate assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million impact on net pension and other retirement benefit costs in  before consideration of expense allocation to affiliates 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over a year period  which represents the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation on the statements of financial position and accumulated other comprehensive income in in accordance with fas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
these amounts are systematically recognized as an increase to future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fas in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected long term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions  as there are typically not significant changes in the asset mix 
the long term rate of return is based on historical long term returns for asset classes included in the pension plan s target allocation 
a reasonably possible change of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million impact on net pension benefit cost before consideration of reimbursement from affiliates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us in determining our pension and retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations
