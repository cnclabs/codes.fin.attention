item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were founded in to develop  manufacture and sell high performance signal analysis tools to scientists engaged in high energy physics research 
in we introduced our first oscilloscope using our core competency of designing signal acquisition and digitizing technology 
we are a leading  worldwide provider of oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers as well as a provider of related test and measurement equipment and currently operate as one business segment in the test and measurement market 
our oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems  to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market 
we currently offer six families of oscilloscopes  which address different solutions to the markets we serve waveexpert  a powerful family of sampling oscilloscopes and modules  wavemaster  one of our high performance product families  wavepro  which is targeted at the mid to high performance sector  waverunner  designed for the mid performance sector  wavesurfer  designed for value oriented users in the low performance bandwith sector of the market  and wavejet  our entry level oscilloscope products 
our protocol analyzers are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high speed serial data interfaces  including usb  bluetooth  pci express  serial ata  serial attached scsi sas  wireless usb  and others 
we sell our products into a broad range of end markets  including computer semiconductor consumer electronics  data storage  automotive industrial  and military aerospace markets 
we believe that our products offer the strongest value proposition in these markets by providing advanced analysis capabilities coupled with innovative and proprietary technology features 
we believe designers in all of these markets are developing products which rely on increasingly complex electronic signals to provide the features and performance their customers require 
we employ a direct sales model utilizing a highly skilled global sales force where it makes economic sense to do so 
we supplement our direct sales force with a combination of manufacturers representatives and distributors in certain geographic areas 
we divided the world into four areas north america  europe middle east  japan and asia pacific 
in north america we sell our products directly in the united states and have a strong manufacturers representative channel 
in europe middle east  we sell our products directly in switzerland  germany  italy  france  the united kingdom and sweden 
in japan  we sell our products through distributors 
in asia pacific  we sell our products directly in south korea  singapore and five regions in china 
we generate revenue in a single segment within the test and measurement market  primarily from the sale of our oscilloscopes  protocol analyzers  probes  accessories  and applications solutions 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from the sales of our extended warranty  maintenance contracts and repairs and calibrations on our instruments after their warranties expire 
generally  we transact revenues and pay our operating expenses in the local currencies of the countries in which we have a direct distribution presence or other operations  with limited exceptions  most notably in china where our sales and operating expenses are denominated in us dollars 
in europe middle east  we transact business in euros  swiss francs  british pounds  swedish krona and us dollars 
in japan  we transact business in japanese yen 
in south korea  we transact business in korean won and in singapore  we transact business in both us dollars and singapore dollars 
for a discussion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  see below  item a of this part ii entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

table of contents historically  we have  at times  experienced lower levels of demand during our first fiscal quarter than in other fiscal quarters which  we believe  have been principally due to the lower level of general market activity during the summer months  particularly in europe 
cost of revenues represents manufacturing and service costs  which primarily comprise materials  labor and factory overhead 
gross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues 
additional factors integral to gross profit earned on our products are mix  as the list prices of our products range from  to  and the effects of foreign currencies  as approximately two thirds of our revenues are derived overseas  much of which is denominated in local currencies while product manufacturing costs are primarily us dollar denominated 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel as well as legal  accounting and other professional services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of masks  wafers and other materials and related test services and equipment used in the development process 
our results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors 
as discussed below  we believe the most significant recurring factors are the economic strength of the technology markets into which we sell our products  our ability to identify market demands and develop competitive products to meet those demands  the announcements and actions of our competitors and our ability to enter into new markets and broaden our presence in existing markets 
our sales are largely dependent on the health and growth of technology companies whose operations tend to be cyclical 
consequently  demand for our products tends to coincide with the increase or decrease in capital spending in the technology industry 
in addition  in response to fluctuations in the technology markets we target  we continually assess and adopt programs aimed at positioning us for long term success 
these programs may include streamlining operations  discontinuing older and less profitable product lines  changing our future product strategy  and reducing operating expenses from time to time 
as an example  we implemented business realignment and restructuring initiatives intended to reduce costs and more efficiently allocate product development resources 
for a more detailed discussion of our restructuring efforts in fiscal  and  see the section entitled business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments  below 
we face significant competition in our target markets 
we believe that in order to continue to compete successfully  we need to timely anticipate  recognize and respond to changing market demands by providing products that serve our customers needs as they arise at prices acceptable to the market 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competition in each of these areas 
consequently  we are constantly reviewing our product development strategy and invest time  resources and capital in development projects we deem most likely to succeed 
in furtherance of our drive to meet our customers changing demands  we also look outside our organization for opportunities to expand our markets 
accordingly  on october  and october   we completed the acquisitions of computer access technology corporation catc and catalyst enterprises  inc catalyst  respectively  to complement our expanding portfolio of serial data test solutions 
this division  protocol solutions group psg  now represents about of our total business 
in march  we completed purchase and settlement agreements with iwatsu electric corporation that included the rights to a new low end product line  viewgo  re engineered and launched as the wavejet family of products  as well as unrelated intellectual property designs and a year non compete agreement 
also in fiscal  we transformed our entire low and mid range product lines by introducing a new line of waverunners and wavesurfers and adding the new wavejet product line noted above 
additionally  we expanded our high end product line by introducing the sda we believe that our diversified product mix strategically positions us to expand our presence in the oscilloscope market 

table of contents catalyst acquisition on september   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement among the company  franklin congress corporation  a california corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company sub  catalyst  and nader salehomoum  as equityholder representative  pursuant to which sub merged with and into catalyst the catalyst merger  with catalyst continuing as the surviving corporation and as a owned subsidiary of the company 
catalyst is a manufacturer of data bus analysis and emulation tools for advanced serial data communications and strengthens the company s position in protocol solutions 
the catalyst merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the total consideration be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
on october   the effective date of the catalyst merger  all shares of common stock of catalyst issued and outstanding immediately prior to the catalyst merger were exchanged for approximately million in cash immediately 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  of the stated consideration was placed into escrow for the twelve month period following the closing of the catalyst merger to secure certain indemnification obligations under the terms of the merger agreement 
lecroy paid cash of million  including direct transaction costs of million  net of cash acquired of million  using proceeds from the revolver under the prior credit agreement  issued a million  promissory note payable on january   to nader salehomoum  the former sole shareholder of catalyst and current employee of the company and assumed the fair value of certain vested catalyst stock options totaling million see note catalyst acquisition and note long term debt and capital leases for additional information 
business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments the following business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments represent our best efforts to respond to the current demands in our industry 
however  these and future cost reductions  or other benefits expected from the business realignment and restructuring initiatives may be insufficient to align our operations with customer demand and the changes affecting our industry  or may be more costly or extensive than currently anticipated 
fiscal business realignment and related asset impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the catalyst tradename failed the impairment test as a result of a change in our product strategy  and therefore  we recorded an approximate million non cash charge to selling  general and administrative expense for the impairment 
our change in product strategy resulted from the development of a next generation product architecture  which supports the best features of the lecroy and catalyst product lines 
this change in product strategy allows us to streamline our product offering and provide customers with products that incorporate the best of both worlds  while freeing up resources consumed by the old dual product line structure 
in the third quarter of fiscal  as a result of streamlining operational management processes and staffing requirements  we recorded severance of approximately million  which was expensed to selling  general and administrative 
this resulted from headcount reductions of three employees or of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   approximately million has been paid in cash and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
severance is estimated to be paid by the end of the third quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  primarily as the result of an effort to improve sales effectiveness and channel management  we recorded severance of approximately million  which was expensed to selling  general and administrative 
this resulted from headcount reductions of twelve employees or of the workforce as compared to june  as of june   approximately million has been paid in cash and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
severance is estimated to be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents fiscal restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of local economic conditions in japan  we changed our japan sales strategy and approved a restructuring plan related to the japanese operations which resulted in the closure of certain office facilities in japan  which included lease termination costs 
as a result of the office closures  there were headcount reductions of four employees or of the workforce as compared to july  as a result  we recorded severance and related expenses of approximately million and facility closure costs of approximately million  which was expensed to selling  general and administrative 
as of june   approximately million has been paid in cash and no accrual remains on the consolidated balance sheet 
fiscal business realignment and related asset impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an intangible asset failed the impairment test due to a change in our product strategy and  accordingly  we took an approximate million non cash charge to cost of revenues for the impairment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  prompted by the acquisition of catalyst  we evaluated certain business processes and staffing requirements 
as a result  we recorded severance and related expense of approximately million  of which approximately million was expensed to cost of revenues  million was expensed to selling  general and administrative and million was expensed to research and development 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of thirty three employees or of the workforce as compared to july  as of june   approximately million has been paid in cash and approximately million remains in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
severance and other related amounts under this plan are estimated to be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of a change in our organization stemming from the catalyst acquisition  we recorded severance and related expenses of approximately million  of which approximately million was expensed to selling  general and administrative and million was expensed to research and development 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of eleven employees or of the workforce as compared to july  severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid by the end of fiscal fiscal business realignment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we realigned some of our business processes and as a result  incurred severance and related expenses of approximately million  of which approximately million was expensed to cost of revenues  million was expensed to research and development and million was expensed to selling  general and administrative 
the implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of sixteen employees or of the workforce as compared to july  as of june   severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid 

table of contents the table below summarizes the charges for business realignment  restructuring initiatives and related asset impairments for the fiscal years ended  and see note inventories for additional information 
in thousands years ended june  june  july  charges for impaired intangible assets severance and related costs cost of revenues charges for severance and related costs research and development charges for impaired intangible asset severance and related costs facility closure selling  general and administrative critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s judgment and available information and  consequently  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  reserves on accounts receivable  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  uncertain tax positions  valuation of deferred tax assets  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  estimation of warranty liabilities and share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products  services  and other arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of allowances for anticipated returns  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  or when services have been provided 
the price is considered fixed or determinable when it is not subject to refund or adjustments 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 

table of contents due to the significant software content of our protocol analyzer products  we recognize revenue on the sale of these products in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  upon shipment provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are recognized as revenue 
revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in test and measurement products in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  in an effort to provide end user customers an alternative to purchasing the company s higher end products under its standard terms and conditions  the company began offering customers an opportunity to enter into sales type or direct financing leases for these products 
the company is accounting for these leases in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
lease and rental revenues are reported within test and measurement product revenue 
reserves on accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to the portion of the accounts receivable which we estimate is non collectible 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes the allowance for anticipated returns  was approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively 
changes in the overall economic environment or in the financial condition of our customers may require adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete raw materials and work in process inventory 
our marketing department plays a key role in our inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with our manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
based upon management s forecast  inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventory s quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 
uncertain tax positions 
on july   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as amended by fasb staff position no 
fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations 
we reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained 
under fin  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within twelve months of the reporting date 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have recorded approximately million of deferred tax assets as of june  for the future tax benefits of temporary differences between our financial statements and tax return 
significant components of our deferred tax assets are federal  state and foreign net operating loss and credit carryforwards  deferred research expenses  inventory reserves and other reserves 
the recorded amount of approximately million is net of reductions in our gross deferred tax assets for tax exposures under fin tax exposures under fin that reduced the carrying amount of our deferred tax assets totaled approximately million as of june  and approximately million upon adoption of fin on july  in addition to the reduction of our gross deferred tax assets under fin  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of june  to reserve for certain tax credits  capital loss carryforwards and foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets 
the recognition of the deferred tax asset  after accounting for tax exposures under fin  is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the benefit of these tax benefits 
the factors that management considered in assessing the likelihood of realization included  the forecast of future taxable income  reversal of taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded 
such adjustments may be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations when made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets and intangible assets including technology  manufacturing and distribution rights and patents and other intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable  but not less than once annually 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets by determining whether the carrying values of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amounts exceed the fair value 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance by us relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we recognized intangible asset impairments of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  due to changes in product strategy  which eliminated the usefulness and value of the assets 
there was no impairment indicators during fiscal year ended july  valuation of goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires management to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such an event may occur if  for an extended period of time  the market value of the company s common stock plus a control premium were less than the carrying value of the company 
we obtain information on sales of similar sized companies in the technology industry to estimate a control premium 
management also reviews our financial position quarterly for other triggering events as described in sfas should actual results not meet expectations or assumptions change in future years  the impairment assessment could result in a lower fair value estimate which could result in an impairment charge that may materially affect the carrying value of our assets and results from operations 
impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
a reporting unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level as described in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we have one reporting unit  in the test and measurement business  because none of the components of our company constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the results of operations 

table of contents the first step is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in this second step  the implied fair value as defined in sfas of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
as our company consists of only one reporting unit  and is publicly traded  management estimates the fair value of its reporting unit utilizing our market capitalization  multiplying the number of actual shares outstanding by a one year average market price  as reflected on nasdaq national market  and applying an additional premium to give effect to management s best estimate of a control premium  as if our company were to be acquired by a single stockholder  which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions related to our company 
a control premium was utilized in our goodwill impairment testing in fiscal this control premium is not a standard amount based on broad assumptions  rather  the amount is based on detailed analysis that considers appropriate industry  market  economic and other pertinent factors  including  indications of such premiums from data on recent acquisition transactions 
the control premium is reviewed periodically  taking into consideration current industry  market and economic conditions along with other factors or available information specific to our business 
as a result of the decline in our stock price since june   which affected our market capitalization  we updated our goodwill impairment test during interim periods in fiscal to identify whether a potential impairment of our recorded goodwill existed 
no impairment resulted from our fiscal interim testing 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its annual impairment testing date from fiscal year end to the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year 
the company believes the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year is preferable as it provides the company additional time to complete the impairment test and report the results of that test in the company s annual filing on form k 
we completed our annual impairment test required under sfas for both fiscal and and determined that there was no impairment to the recorded goodwill balance of million and million  respectively 
management s estimate of an appropriate control premium to apply in determining fair value is an important variable in our goodwill impairment assessment  and is subject to change 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position and results of operations 
warranty liabilities 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability and for certain new products  published by a third party expected failure rates 
the expected failure is arrived at in terms of units  which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the amount of accrued warranty required 
on a quarterly basis  we study trends of warranty claims  review estimates of costs to repair and take action to improve the quality of our products and minimize our warranty exposure 
the warranty reserve was approximately million  million  and million at june   june  and july   respectively 
management believes that the warranty reserve is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
share based compensation expense 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights 
the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant  
table of contents while the fair value for stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period  since it is liability classified 
determining the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights requires certain estimates by management including the expected volatility and expected term of the option 
management also makes decisions regarding the risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates regarding forfeiture rates 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate or if we reevaluate the forfeiture rate in the future  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods 
further  fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
total share based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended june   june  and july  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of our total revenues for the fiscal years indicated year ended june  june  july  revenues test and measurement products service and other total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative legal settlement research and development reimbursement from escrow account total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense write off of bank deferred financing fees gain on extinguishment of convertible debt  net of issue cost write off other  net other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss certain reclassifications have been made to prior years amounts to conform to the current year presentation 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were approximately for the year ended june   compared to approximately million in the prior year  representing an increase of  or approximately million  primarily as a result of increased sales of test and measurement products and positive foreign currency impact 
foreign currency fluctuations increased total revenues by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the 
table of contents increase in test and measurement products was driven mainly by increased oscilloscope product shipments as a result of an improved distribution channel and the incremental impact from the catalyst acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal  which was approximately of revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreased demand and softness in orders from japan 
service and other revenues primarily consist of service revenues and maintenance fees 
service and other revenues were approximately million for the year ended june   representing an increase of or approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of a company wide service initiative that began during fiscal to improve customer service by focusing on opportunities to add value to our products  positive foreign currency impact and an improved distribution channel 
our geographic breakdown of revenues by area in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues is as follows in thousands june  june  june  june  north america north america europe middle east europe middle east japan japan asia pacific asia pacific total revenues total revenues for the year end june   the geographic revenues in terms of dollars were higher in all regions except japan 
the increases in europe middle east and asia pacific were driven by strong distribution channels and improved sales productivity  as well as favorable foreign currency impact 
improved performance in north america resulted from our reorganized distribution channel  including a network of manufacturers representatives 
foreign currency fluctuations increased europe middle east revenues by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were offset by decreases in japan  primarily from the realignment of our japan operations at the end of fiscal and local economic conditions 
gross profit for the year ended june  was approximately million  or gross margin  compared to million  or gross margin  for the same period last year 
the lower gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to approximately million of costs associated with an inventory write down  including inventory recorded at fair value in the purchase accounting for catalyst and the elimination of a product line  million of costs associated with the sell through of stepped up inventory acquired in the catalyst acquisition  million relating to the implementation of a business realignment and million charge for the impairment of an intangible asset 
the gross margin in fiscal included approximately million for inventory write downs 
approximately million resulted from a change in the company s product strategy and approximately million related to certain inventory recorded at fair value in the purchase accounting for catalyst  a portion of which we were indemnified 
this charge was partially offset by a reduction in amortization expense for an acquired catalyst intangible asset of approximately million 
absent these non cash charges in both years  fiscal margins as a percentage of sales were consistent with the fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  representing a decrease of or approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in general spending levels  resulting from the prior year s cost cutting efforts 
business realignment charges in fiscal were approximately million 
additionally  the catalyst trade name failed the intangible asset impairment test due to a change in our product strategy  and accordingly we took a non cash charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal business realignment and restructuring charges in fiscal were approximately million  prompted by the acquisition of catalyst as well as the reorganization of our japan facility 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of a higher sales base as well as benefits derived from fiscal cost cutting and realignment efforts 

table of contents research and development r d expense was approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of or approximately million 
as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from the million charge for acquired in process research and development costs related to the catalyst acquisition and approximately million of realignment charges  both recorded in fiscal also contributing to the decrease in r d expense were reductions in expenses in fiscal incurred for prototype materials and supplies and general spending levels 
reimbursement from escrow account represents fiscal income resulting from the final catalyst indemnification release 
we received approximately million from the remaining catalyst escrow balance  representing the indemnification obligation for certain catalyst inventory  assumed at acquisition 
other expense  net  which consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign exchange gains and losses  was approximately million for the year ended june   compared to approximately million for fiscal net interest expense was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
there was a foreign exchange loss of approximately million in fiscal compared to a loss of approximately million in the prior year  resulting from the changes in our foreign exchange forward contracts and on transactions denominated in other than our functional currency or that of our subsidiaries 
additionally  fiscal other expense  net includes a gain on extinguishment of convertible debt  net of issue cost write off of approximately million  resulting from the repurchase of million of the our convertible notes 
fiscal other expense  net includes a charge of approximately million for the write off of bank deferred financing fees associated with the repayment of the term loan and revolver under the prior credit agreement 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal includes the effect of a reduction of tax expense of approximately million resulting from true ups of the tax provision to previously filed tax returns  and an election for certain r d credits made by the company in the second quarter of fiscal  a reduction of tax expense of approximately million from the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and an increase in tax expense of approximately million for the write down of the deferred tax asset related to restricted stock grants that resulted in a shortfall of cumulative tax benefits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal includes the effects of the in process research and development ipr d charge of million related to the catalyst acquisition  which is not deductible for tax purposes  and an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately million 
the company calculates income tax expense benefit based upon an annual estimated effective tax rate that includes estimates and assumptions that may change during the year 
the differences between the annual estimated effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of principally result from the company s geographical distribution of taxable income  and differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenues were million for the year ended june   compared to million in the prior year  a net decrease of  or million 
the total decrease in revenue was partially offset by revenue derived from the catalyst acquisition which mitigated the impact by and favorable currency fluctuation of 
revenues from test and measurement products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in test and measurement products was mainly due to a reduction in shipments to our disk drive customers as a result of decreased demand  the longer than anticipated time to finalize our new distributor arrangement in japan  and the reduction in the average selling prices in our high end products which have been impacted by competitive pressure in the marketplace 
additionally  mid and low end products have not penetrated the market fully  and there has been lower than expected demand from our next generation products and serial data protocol solutions 
these decreases were partially offset by the addition of revenue from our september acquisition of catalyst as noted above 
service and other revenues consist primarily of service revenue and license and maintenance fees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we purchase materials from suppliers and sell our products around the world and maintain investments in foreign subsidiaries  all denominated in a variety of currencies 
as a consequence  we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to a number of currencies  changes in government policies and legal and regulatory requirements  and political instability 
among the more significant potential risks to us of relative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is the relationship among and between the us dollar  euro  swiss franc  british pound  swedish krona  japanese yen  korean won and singapore dollar 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as third party vendor payments  revenues and intercompany payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows  we have a program of entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of us or our subsidiaries 
it cannot be assured  however  that this program will effectively offset all of our foreign currency risk related to these assets or liabilities 
these foreign exchange forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities sfas no 

other than this program  we do not attempt to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks by entering into foreign currency management programs 
as a consequence  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future resulting in mismatches between local currency revenues and expenses  the translation of foreign currencies into the us dollar  our financial reporting currency  or otherwise  will not adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect the demand for our products 

table of contents during fiscal  and  foreign currency exchange losses on these derivatives and on transactions denominated in other than the subsidiaries functional currencies were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these net losses are included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
at june  and june   the notional amounts of the company s open foreign exchange forward contracts  all with maturities of less than six months  were approximately million and million  respectively 
we performed a sensitivity analysis at june   assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on our open foreign exchange forward contracts and our assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies 
in management s opinion  a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have an immaterial effect on these instruments and therefore  on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  and cash flows from operations 
on october   we completed the sale of million of convertible senior notes the notes due october  the notes will pay interest semiannually through maturity and will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
upon conversion of the notes  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of the outstanding convertible notes  resulting in a balance of million at june  as of june   the market value of our convertible notes was approximately million 
we are exposed to adverse changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment in cash and cash equivalents  as well as  our million credit facility 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  which would have been immaterial to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in fiscal
