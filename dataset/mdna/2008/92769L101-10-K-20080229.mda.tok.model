acquisitions and disposals acquisition of virgin mobile on july   we acquired of the outstanding shares and options of virgin mobile through a uk scheme of arrangement for a purchase price totaling million  including cash of million  common stock valued at million and direct transaction costs of million 
reverse acquisition of telewest on march   ntl merged with a subsidiary of telewest and the merger has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of telewest using the purchase method 
in connection with this transaction  telewest changed its name to ntl incorporated  and has since changed its name to virgin media inc the total purchase price was billion  including cash of billion  common stock valued at billion  stock options with a fair value of million and direct transaction costs of million 
sale of broadcast and ireland operations on january   we sold our broadcast operations  a provider of commercial television and radio transmission services  to a consortium led by macquarie communications infrastructure group 
the cash proceeds from the sale were billion 
our broadcast operations provided site leasing  broadcast transmission  satellite  media  public safety communications and other network services  utilizing broadcast transmission infrastructure  wireless communications and other facilities 
on may   we sold our telecommunications operations in the republic of ireland to ms irish cable holdings bv  an affiliate of morgan stanley  for an aggregate purchase price of million  or million 
as a result of the sale of our broadcast and ireland operations  we have accounted for the broadcast and ireland operations as discontinued operations 
the results of operations for the broadcast and ireland operations have been excluded from the components of loss from continuing operations and shown in a separate caption  titled income from discontinued operations 
factors affecting our business cable segment in our cable segment  residential customers account for the majority of our total revenue 
the number of residential customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to these customers and by the number of services that we provide to them 
for example  broadband internet is more profitable than our television services and  on average  our triple play customers are more profitable than double play or single play customers 
our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services such as television  telephone and broadband at a lower price than each stand alone product on a combined basis 
factors particularly affecting our profitability include customer churn  average revenue per user arpu  competition  capital expenditures and seasonality 
customer churn 
customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing to our services 
an increase in our customer churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in order to manage our customer churn rate 
our ability to reduce our customer churn rate beyond a base level is limited by factors like competition and customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season 
managing our customer churn rate is a significant component of our business plan 
our customer churn rate may increase if our customer service is seen as unsatisfactory  if we are unable to deliver our services over our network without interruption  or if we fail to match offerings by our competitors 
cable arpu 
average revenue per user  or arpu  is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from our residential cable customers on our network 
we believe that our triple play cable offering of television  broadband and fixed line telephone services is attractive to our existing customer base and generally allows us to increase our cable arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
cable arpu excludes any recognition of revenue from our mobile segment 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant and increasing competition in the market for our consumer services  including broadband and telephone services offered by bt and resellers or local loop unbundlers  such as bskyb and carphone warehouse talk talk  alternative internet access services like dsl  satellite television services offered by bskyb  digital terrestrial television offered through freeview  internet protocol television offered by tiscali and bt  and mobile telephone services offered by other mobile telephone operators 
our business services also face a range of competitors  including bt and cable wireless 
certain competitors  such as bt and bskyb  are dominant in markets in which we compete and may use their dominance in those markets to offer bundled services that compete with our product offerings 
as a result of increased competition  we have had to  and may be required to continue to  adjust our pricing and offer discounts to new and existing customers in order to attract and retain customers 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network and in new technologies  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
seasonality 
some revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by residential customers and businesses tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
our customer churn rates include persons who disconnect their service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodation between academic years 
mobile segment factors particularly affecting our mobile segment include competition  seasonality and our third party distribution arrangements 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in our markets from mobile operators  including o  vodafone  orange  t mobile and  and from other mobile virtual network operators  including tesco mobile  bt mobile and carphone warehouse 
many of our competitors are part of large multinational organizations  have substantial advertising and marketing budgets  and have a significant retail presence 
if competitive forces prevent us from charging the prices for these services that we plan to charge  or if our competition is able to attract our customers or potential customers we are targeting  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
seasonality 
some revenue streams and cost drivers are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  in the fourth quarter of each year our customer acquisition and retention costs typically increase due to the christmas holiday period 
our arpu generally decreases in the first quarter of each year due to the fewer number of days in february and lower usage after the christmas holiday period 
during the summer holiday months  roaming revenue is generally higher as a result of increased international travel 
distribution 
we primarily rely upon third parties to distribute our mobile products and services 
if any of these distribution partners were to cease to act as distributors for our products and services  or the commissions or other costs charged by the third parties were to increase  our ability to gain new customers or retain existing customers may be adversely affected 
we also distribute our products through our own retail outlets 
content segment factors particularly affecting our content segment include competition  the number of buyers for our television channels  our access to content  seasonality and advertising revenue 
competition 
our television channels compete with other broadcasters for advertising revenues  subscription revenues  and programming rights 
sit up competes with a large variety of retailers in the uk market and with other television channels for audiences 
ids  our advertising sales department  competes with advertising sales operations representing other television broadcasters 
limited number of buyers 
the principal third party buyer of our television channels is bskyb 
other than bskyb  there are no significant buyers of our television channels 
access to content 
most of the television content on the virgin media tv channels is purchased  mainly from the us  and because there is a limited supply of content available and an increasing number of digital channels in the uk  virgin media tv has experienced and may continue to experience an increase in the cost of its programming 
seasonality 
our content segment incurs increased costs in the fourth quarter of each year due to the need to provide enhanced programming over the important christmas holiday period 
also  sit up records increased revenues and costs in the fourth quarter due to generally higher retail sales in the lead up to the christmas holiday 
advertising revenue 
the majority of revenue for virgin media tv is from advertisers 
consequently  virgin media tv s revenue is directly affected by changes in the total spend on television advertising in the uk  the viewing levels for its channels and the proportion of the uk advertising market represented by ids 
general other factors affecting our business include currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
we have implemented a hedging program to seek to mitigate the risk from these exposures 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
integration 
we continue to integrate our legacy ntl and telewest cable businesses and virgin mobile 
this involves the incurrence of substantial operating and capital expenditures and  in some cases  involves the outsourcing of key functions in an effort to achieve synergies through the integration of the businesses 
we will be completing the final stages of the integration of our cable billing platforms during any issues that may arise in connection with our integration could have a material negative effect on our financial performance 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
impairment of long lived assets and indefinite lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives to be held and used by an entity are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations  reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives  are subject to annual review for impairment or more frequently should indications of impairment arise 
impairment of goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets is determined using a two step approach  initially based on a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  then the second step compares the asset s fair value implied fair value for goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets with its carrying value to measure the amount of the impairment 
impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
we evaluate our cable reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as at december  while all other reporting units are evaluated as at june in the future  we may incur impairment charges under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  or fas  if market values decline and we do not achieve expected cash flow growth rates 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows and those estimates include inherent uncertainties  including those relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with our internal forecasts 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in the impairment review  we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
fixed assets labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our management use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and customer lists  the trademark s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio and discount rates 
management s assumptions about fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect management s estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in particular  liabilities in relation to tax exposures or liabilities to restructure the pre acquisition businesses of ntl  telewest and virgin mobile  including the exit of properties and termination of employees  are revised as estimates are updated 
restructuring costs as of january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or fas  and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of fas did not have a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
prior to  we recognized a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities at the time a commitment to restructure was given  in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  or eitf liabilities for costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to january  continue to be accounted for under eitf in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given to sublessees  amounts of lease termination costs  and discount rates 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  income tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to some uncertainty 
examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals  issues related to consideration paid or received in connection with acquisitions  and certain financing transactions 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
at each period end  we make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including  but not limited to  the expected operating income or loss for the year  projections of the proportion of income or loss earned and taxed in the uk and the extent to which this income or loss may also be taxed in the us  permanent and temporary differences  the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain tax positions taken in respect to matters such as business acquisitions and disposals and certain financing transactions including intercompany transactions  amongst others  and we accrue a liability when we believe an assessment is probable and the amount is estimable 
in accordance with gaap  the impact of revisions to these estimates are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used to compute the provision for income taxes have and will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our tax environment changes 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  or fas fas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
fas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
fas is effective for certain financial instruments included in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and for all other non financial instruments for fiscal years beginning after november  the provisions of fas relating to certain financial instruments are required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of effective january  while we are still addressing the impact of the adoption of this standard it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or fas fas allows companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fas will have on our consolidated financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine its effects 
consolidated results of operations from continuing operations consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue increased by to  million from  million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the reverse acquisition of telewest and the inclusion of its revenues from march   and to the acquisition of virgin mobile and the inclusion of its revenues from july   as compared to their inclusion for the full year in offsetting this has been an underlying decline in revenue in our cable and content segments due to the factors described below in our segmental results of operations for the years ended december  and expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from  million during the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and to the acquisition of virgin mobile 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in  due to a decline in gross margins in our cable segment together with the full year impact in of the inclusion of the telewest content segment subsequent to the reverse acquisition of telewest and the new mobile segment subsequent to the acquisition of virgin mobile  since these segments have lower gross margins than our cable segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million for the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and to the acquisition of virgin mobile and higher marketing costs in connection with the virgin media rebrand  partially offset by a reduction in our employee expenses as a result of our integration activities together with lower company bonus scheme payments  a reduction in our share based compensation expense resulting primarily from stock and option forfeitures  lower bad debt expense due to operational improvements in our billing and collections following the integration of our systems and processes  and gains resulting from the settlement of certain contractual issues 
other charges other charges of million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  related primarily to employee termination costs and lease exit costs in connection with our restructuring programs initiated in respect of the reverse acquisition of telewest

interest income and other  net for the year ended december   interest income and other decreased to million from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased losses on disposals of fixed assets and a decline in interest income due to lower average cash balances  partially offset by a gain on disposal of investments 
in  interest income and other included gains on disposal of investments totaling million  offset by losses on disposal of fixed assets totaling million 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to the additional borrowings resulting from the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile 
we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash interest payments resulted from the additional borrowings following the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile  and changes in the timing of interest payments 
loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  and related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of our partial repayments under our senior credit facility 
for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  and related primarily to the write off of deferred financing costs on our previous senior credit facility that was repaid upon completion of the refinancing of the reverse acquisition of telewest 
share of income from equity investments for the year ended december   share of income from equity investments was million as compared with income of million for the same period in the income from equity investments in the year ended december  was largely comprised of our proportionate share of the income earned by uktv 
the increase in our proportionate share of the income earned by uktv was primarily due to the inclusion of uktv within our content segment only from march  following the reverse acquisition of telewest as compared with its inclusion for a full year in  together with an increase in uktv s net income in resulting primarily from additional advertising revenue 
loss gain from derivative instruments the loss from derivative instruments of million in the year ended december   primarily related to losses on cross currency interest rate swaps not designated as hedges offset by hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps 
the gain from derivative instruments of million in the year ended december  related primarily to favorable movements in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges 
foreign currency transaction gains losses for the year ended december   foreign currency transaction gains were million as compared with losses of million for the same period in the foreign currency transaction gains in the year ended december  were largely comprised of favorable exchange rate movements in our us dollar long term debt and payables 
the foreign currency losses in the year ended december  were largely comprised of foreign exchange losses of million on us dollar forward purchase contracts that were entered into to economically hedge the repayment of our us dollar denominated bridge facility 
the repayment of billion of this facility on june  resulted in an offsetting gain during the period of million that was recorded as a component of equity 
our results of operations will continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations since million of our indebtedness is denominated in us dollars and million of our indebtedness is denominated in euros 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   income tax expense was million as compared with an income tax benefit of million for the same period in the and expense benefit was composed of in millions us state and local income tax foreign tax deferred us income tax alternative minimum tax total in  we received refunds of million in respect of pre acquisition periods of virgin mobile and million of us federal income tax relating to pre acquisition periods of telewest

in addition  we paid million of uk tax expense in respect of pre acquisition periods of virgin mobile 
loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   loss from continuing operations decreased to million from a loss of million for the same period in due to the factors discussed above 
loss from continuing operations per share basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per common share for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss per share is computed using a weighted average of million shares issued and outstanding in the year ended december  and a weighted average of million shares issued and outstanding for the same period in options and warrants to purchase shares along with shares of restricted stock held in escrow outstanding at december  and were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share  since the inclusion of such options  warrants and restricted stock are anti dilutive 
segmental results of operations for the years ended december  and a description of the products and services  as well as year to date financial data  for each segment can be found in note to virgin media s consolidated financial statements 
the segment results for the year ended december  included in our consolidated financial statements are reported on an actual basis and include the results of telewest and virgin mobile for the full year 
the segment results for the year ended december  included in our consolidated financial statements are reported on an actual basis and include the results of telewest from march  and the results of virgin mobile from july  the results of operations of each of our cable and content segments reported in this section for the year ended december  are reported on an actual basis and for the year ended december  are reported on a pro forma combined basis as if the reverse acquisition of telewest had occurred at the beginning of the period presented and combine telewest s historical content and sit up segments into the combined company s content segment 
the pro forma data has been calculated on a basis consistent with the pro forma financial information filed with the securities and exchange commission under our form k a on may  we believe that a pro forma comparison of these segments is more relevant than a historic comparison as a in respect of our cable segment  the size of the acquired legacy telewest cable business would obscure any meaningful discussion of changes in our cable segment if viewed on a historical basis  and b we did not have a content segment prior to march  comparative pro forma results of our mobile segment have not been presented 
the reportable segments disclosed in this annual report are based on our management organizational structure as of december  future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed 
segment operating income before depreciation  amortization and other charges  which we refer to as segment ocf  is management s measure of segment profit as permitted under fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our management  including our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker  considers segment ocf as an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our segments 
segment ocf excludes the impact of costs and expenses that do not directly affect our cash flows 
other charges  including restructuring charges  are also excluded from segment ocf as management believes they are not characteristic of our underlying business operations 
cable segment the summary combined results of operations of our cable segment were as follows in millions year ended december  actual pro forma revenue   inter segment revenue segment ocf   depreciation  amortization and other charges   operating income revenue our cable segment revenue by customer type for the years ended december  and was as follows in millions year ended december  actual pro forma increase decrease revenue consumer   business total revenue   consumer for the year ended december   revenue from residential customers decreased by to  million from pro forma revenue of  million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number of fixed line telephone customers  reductions in telephony usage and higher price discounting to stimulate customer activity and retention in light of competitive factors in the marketplace 
in addition  in we took significant steps to increase alignment of the prices paid by our existing customers with the prices paid by new customers 
partially offsetting these decreases have been increases in revenue from selective telephony price increases as well as from additional customers subscribing to our television and broadband services 
cable arpu decreased to for the three months ended december  from for the three months ended december  the decrease in cable arpu was due to reduced telephony usage and higher price discounting as discussed above 
the decline has been mitigated by our focus on acquiring new bundled customers and cross selling and up selling to existing customers 
our focus on acquiring new bundled customers and on cross selling to existing customers is shown by cable revenue generating units  or cable rgus  per customer increasing to at december  from at december  and by triple play penetration growing to at december  from at december  a triple play customer is a customer who subscribes to our television  broadband and fixed line telephone services 
business for the year ended december   revenue from business customers decreased by to million from million on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to declines in telephony voice revenues  partially offset by growth in data revenue in our retail sales channel 
retail data revenues represented of the retail business revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  we anticipate that the revenue from our wholesale sales channel will decline in due to continued reduction in our internet service provider subscriber base and certain mobile customer contract accounts 
consequently  business revenue overall in is expected to be lower than in  although we continue to expect higher retail data revenue 
business revenue was comprised of in millions year ended december  actual pro forma increase decrease business revenue retail voice data other wholesale total business revenue cable segment ocf for the year ended december   cable segment ocf increased by to  million from  million on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  lower consumer and business revenues have been more than offset by savings in operating costs and selling  general and administrative costs 
cost savings resulting from the integration activities since the reverse acquisition of telewest  including improvements in bad debt expense  lower company bonus scheme payments and a reduction in share based compensation expense were partially offset by marketing and advertising costs incurred in connection with the rebrand to virgin media in the first quarter of summary cable statistics selected statistics for residential cable customers of virgin media  excluding customers off our network and virgin mobile customers  for the three months ended december  as well as the four prior quarters  are set forth in the table below 
the total number of cable customers directly connected to our network fell by  during the six months ended june  partly as a result of the increase in competition in the marketplace together with the removal of bskyb s basic channels from our platform and increased during the second half of the year by  reflecting our focus on reducing customer churn during this period  particularly in the fourth quarter during which our average monthly churn fell to 
the total number of cable rgus grew to  at december  from  at december   representing an increase in net rgus of  of which  were added in the fourth quarter of three months ended december  september  june  march  december  opening customers    customer additions     customer disconnects    net customer movement     closing customers    cable churn cable revenue generating units television     dtv included in television   telephone     broadband     total cable revenue generating units   cable rgu customer x x x x x triple play penetration cable average revenue per user cable arpu calculation on net cable revenues millions average customers    customer churn is calculated by taking the total disconnects during the month and dividing them by the average number of customers during the month 
average monthly churn during a quarter is the average of the three monthly churn calculations within the quarter 
each telephone  television and broadband internet subscriber directly connected to our network counts as one rgu 
accordingly  a subscriber who receives both telephone and television service counts as two rgus 
rgus may include subscribers receiving some services for free or at a reduced rate in connection with promotional offers

our focus on acquiring new bundled customers and on cross selling to existing customers is shown by cable rgus per customer increasing from at december  to at december  and by the percentage of our customers with triple play services growing from at december  to at december  these increases arose primarily because the number of cable rgus per customer and the percentage of customers were higher in the legacy telewest business than in ntl 
expenses operating costs 
for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from million during the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to the reverse acquisition of telewest and to the acquisition of virgin mobile 
operating costs as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from for the same period in  in part due to the inclusion of the telewest content segment subsequent to the reverse acquisition of telewest and the new mobile segment subsequent to the acquisition of virgin mobile  since these segments have lower margins than our cable segment

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to for the year ended december   from for the same period in  partly due to costs incurred in connection with the integration of ntl and telewest and increased stock based compensation expense offset by savings from lower employee related costs as a result of involuntary employee terminations in the year ended december  other charges other charges of million in the year ended december  related primarily to employee termination costs and lease exit costs in connection with our restructuring programs initiated in respect of the reverse acquisition of telewest

excluding the impact of the reverse acquisition of telewest and of the acquisition of virgin mobile  depreciation expense decreased due to the absence of depreciation on some assets that became fully depreciated in amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in amortization expense related to additional intangible assets arising from the reverse acquisition of telewest and from the acquisition of virgin mobile 
interest income and other for the year ended december   interest income and other increased to million from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased interest rates and additional cash balances throughout the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million from million for the same period in  primarily as a result of the additional borrowings as a result of the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile 
we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash interest payments resulted from the effects of the new senior credit facility and senior bridge facility in respect of the reverse acquisition of telewest and the acquisition of virgin mobile  and changes in the timing of interest payments

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting for electronic waste obligations  or fsp  addressing the accounting for certain obligations associated with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive adopted by the european union 
fsp requires that the commercial user should apply its provisions to certain obligations associated with historical waste as defined by the directive  since this type of obligation is an asset retirement obligation 
the directive was adopted by the uk on december   and was effective january  management reviewed their obligations under the law and concluded that an obligation existed for certain of our customer premises equipment 
as a result we recognized a retirement obligation of million and fixed assets of million on the balance sheet and a cumulative effect change in accounting principle of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
loss from continuing operations per share basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per common share for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per share was computed using a weighted average of million shares issued in the year ended december  and a weighted average of million shares issued for the same period in options and warrants to purchase shares along with shares of restricted stock held in escrow outstanding at december  and  were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share since the inclusion of such options  warrants and restricted stock are anti dilutive

the pro forma data has been calculated on a basis consistent with the pro forma financial information filed with the securities and exchange commission under our form k a on may  we believe that a pro forma comparison of these segments is more relevant than a historic comparison as a in respect of our cable segment  the size of the acquired legacy telewest cable business would obscure any meaningful discussion of changes in our cable segment if viewed on a historical basis  and b we did not have a content segment prior to march  comparative pro forma results of our mobile segment have not been presented

cable segment ocf for the year ended december   pro forma cable segment ocf decreased by to  million from  million for the year ended december  the decrease in ocf was primarily due to increased selling  general and administrative expenses  which included pre acquisition charges of million relating to the reverse acquisition of telewest  consisting of legal and professional charges of million and executive compensation costs and insurance expenses of million  together with integration costs incurred since the acquisition

the cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  included billion from the sale of our broadcast operations 
purchases of fixed assets increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in primarily because of the timing of cash payments and the reverse acquisition of telewest 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  million compared with cash used in financing activities of million in the year ended december  the principal components of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  were the new billion senior credit facility and the million senior notes due the principal uses of cash during were the repayment of our previous senior credit and bridge facilities 
the principal components of the cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  were the repurchases of our common stock in the open market in february and april for million  the prepayment of million on our senior credit facility and redemption of the floating rate senior notes due liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million of debt outstanding  compared to  million as of september  and  million as of december   and million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of september  and million as of december  the decrease in debt since the previous year is primarily attributable to a mandatory prepayment of our senior credit facility of million in may as a result of cash flow generated in  a voluntary prepayment of million in december from existing cash balances  and exchange rate movements on our debt denominated in currencies other than the pound sterling 
our business is capital intensive and we are highly leveraged 
we have significant cash requirements for operating costs  capital expenditure  interest expense and debt amortization requirements 
the level of our capital expenditures and operating expenditures are affected by the significant amounts of capital required to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network  offer new services and integrate our billing systems and customer databases 
we expect that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and undrawn credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through december  however  our cash requirements after december  may exceed these sources of cash 
for instance  debt amortization repayments under our senior credit facility increase significantly in we believe that we will need to address these scheduled principal payments in part through means other than reliance on cash flow from operations  such as raising additional debt or equity  refinancing our existing facility  possible sales of assets  or other means 
we may not be able to obtain financing  or sell assets at all  or on favorable terms  or we may be contractually prevented by the terms of our senior notes or our senior credit facility from incurring additional indebtedness or selling assets 
we are a holding company with no independent operations or significant assets other than our investments in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we will depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
in addition  the terms of our existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which our subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions to us under many circumstances 
our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements

on april   we amended the senior credit facility and borrowed an additional million under a year bullet tranche b term loan facility and a year tranche b term loan facility 
we used the net proceeds to repay some of our obligations under the tranche a and tranche a term loan facilities 
in april  we also amended our senior credit facility to among other things  i enable us to issue this million of additional indebtedness  ii relax certain of our financial covenants  and iii provide us with additional flexibility  including permitting our board of directors  if they so determine  to pay increased levels of dividends on our common stock 
on may   we made a mandatory prepayment of million under our senior credit facility as a result of cash flow generated in on december   we made a voluntary prepayment of million utilizing available cash reserves 
at december   the principal payments are scheduled as follows in millions date amount september  march  september  march  september   march  the senior credit facility other than for tranche c has the benefit of a full and unconditional senior secured guarantee from virgin media finance plc as well as first priority pledges of the shares and assets of substantially all of the operating subsidiaries of virgin media investment holdings limited or vmih and of receivables arising under any intercompany loans to those subsidiaries 
the senior secured guarantee of virgin media finance plc is secured by a first priority pledge of the entire capital stock of vmih and the receivables under any intercompany loans from virgin media finance plc to vmih 
the guarantee of tranche c of the senior credit facility will share in the security of virgin media finance plc granted to the senior credit facility  but will receive proceeds only after the other tranches and will not benefit from guarantees or security granted by other members of the group 
the annual rate of interest payable under our senior credit facility is the sum of i the london intrabank offer rate libor  us libor or european intrabank offer rate euribor  as applicable  plus ii the applicable interest margin and the applicable cost of complying with any reserve requirement 
the applicable interest margin for tranche a  a and the revolving facility depends upon the net leverage ratio then in effect as set forth below leverage ratio margin less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to the applicable interest margins for tranche b and tranche c are as follows facility margin b b b b b b c senior notes on july   virgin media finance plc issued us dollar denominated senior notes due with a principal amount outstanding of million

the senior notes due mature on april  and are guaranteed by virgin media  virgin media group llc  vmih and certain of the intermediate holding companies in the group 
restrictions under our existing debt agreements the agreements governing the senior notes and the senior credit facility significantly and  in some cases absolutely  restrict our ability and the ability of most of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  or redeem or repurchase equity interests or subordinated obligations  make investments  sell assets  including the capital stock of subsidiaries  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or certain vendor financing arrangements  create liens  enter into agreements that restrict the restricted subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  transfer assets or make intercompany loans  merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of their assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we are also subject to financial maintenance covenants under our senior credit facility 
these covenants require us to meet financial covenants on a quarterly basis and the required levels increase over time 
as a result  we will need to continue to improve our operating performance over the next several years to meet these levels 
failure to meet these covenant levels would result in a default under our senior credit facility 
debt ratings to access public debt capital markets  we rely on credit rating agencies to assign corporate credit ratings 
a rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy  sell or hold our securities 
a credit rating agency may change or withdraw our ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets 
the corporate debt ratings and outlook currently assigned by the rating agencies engaged by us are as follows corporate rating outlook moody s investors service inc ba negative standard poor s b stable on august   moody s changed the outlook for virgin media to negative  citing increased competitive pressure in the telephony and mobile businesses 
the company s ratings were unchanged 
on november   standard poor s raised the outlook for virgin media to stable  and affirmed the company s ratings

derivative instruments and hedging activities we have a number of derivative instruments with a number of counterparties to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we account for these instruments as hedges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fas  when the appropriate eligibility criteria has been satisfied  and to the extent that they are effective 
ineffectiveness in our hedges  and instruments that we have not elected for hedge accounting  are recognized through the statement of operations through gains or losses on derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we are subject to interest rate risk because we have substantial indebtedness at variable interest rates 
as of december   interest is determined on a variable basis on billion  or  of indebtedness 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our gross interest expense by million per year  before giving effect to interest rate swaps 
we are also subject to currency exchange rate risks  because substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are paid in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
to the extent that the pound declines in value against the us dollar and the euro  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar and euro denominated debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
as of december   million  or of our indebtedness  was denominated in us dollars and million  or of our indebtedness  was denominated in euros 
interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future interest payments on our senior credit facility  which accrues interest at variable rates based on libor 
the interest rate swaps allow us to receive interest based on libor in exchange for payments of interest at fixed rates between and we have designated some of the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas because they hedge against changes in libor 
the interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
cross currency interest rate swaps we have entered into a number of cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in the pound sterling value of interest payments on the us dollar denominated senior notes due  interest payments on the euro denominated senior notes due  interest payments on the us dollar denominated senior notes due and interest payments on the us dollar and euro denominated tranches of our senior credit facility 
under these cross currency interest rate swaps  we receive interest in us dollars at various fixed and floating rates and in euros at various fixed and floating rates in exchange for payments of interest in pound sterling at various fixed and floating rates 
we have designated some of the cross currency interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under fas  because they hedge against changes in the pound sterling value of the interest payments on the senior notes that result from changes in the us dollar and euro exchange rates 
the cross currency interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss where designated as a hedge  or through loss gain on derivatives where not designated as a hedge 
foreign currency forward contracts we have entered into a number of forward contracts maturing on april  to purchase a total of million 
these contracts economically hedge changes in the pound sterling value of the us dollar denominated principal obligation of the senior notes due caused by changes in the us dollar and pound sterling exchange rates 
the principal obligations under the million senior notes due  the million senior notes due  and the million and million principal obligations under the senior credit facility are hedged via the cross currency interest rate swaps  and therefore separate forward rate contracts for these debt instruments were not necessary 
these foreign currency forward rate contracts have not been designated as hedges under fas as such  the contracts are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized immediately in the income statement 
the foreign currency forward rate contracts do not subject us to material volatility in our earnings and cash flows because changes in the fair value directionally and partially mitigate the gains or losses on the remeasurement of our us dollar denominated debt into our functional currency pound sterling in accordance with fasb statement no 
 foreign currency translation 
changes in fair value of these contracts are reported within foreign currency transaction gains losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  like foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
as some of our indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with variable interest rate payments 
also  substantially all of our revenues and operating costs are earned and paid in pounds sterling but we pay interest and principal obligations on some of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
as of december   million  or of our indebtedness  was denominated in us dollars and million  or  of our indebtedness was denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with changes in foreign exchange rates on payments of principal and interest on a portion of our indebtedness 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
to achieve this objective we have entered into a number of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments utilized comprise interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
