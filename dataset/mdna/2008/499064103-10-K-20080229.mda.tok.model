introduction business overview we are a transportation services provider with headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for customers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on a short to medium length of haul 
we provide regional truckload carrier services from our asset based dry van and temperature controlled service centers  as well as brokerage services from our regional brokerage branches 
the results of our brokerage activities were relatively immaterial for and  therefore  a detailed discussion of the financial results of these operations will not be separately presented 
from to  we achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
in  our growth slowed as a result of economic conditions 
our revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in  and our net income grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in during  we opened eight brokerage branches and four asset based service centers 
as of december   we operated asset based dry van and temperature controlled service centers and brokerage branches 
in early  we opened a brokerage branch in gulfport  mississippi 
operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable freight lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus on operating in distinct geographic markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating modern equipment  maintaining a high driver to non driver employee ratio  and minimizing empty miles 
providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service  in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple stop pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 
using technology to enhance our business 
we use technology to help us be more efficient with our equipment and our headcount 
we recognize the value technology brings as an accelerator in our operations 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open and develop regional service centers and the markets they serve in selected geographic areas and operate the service centers at or near our targeted margins within a relatively short period of time 
the addition of our brokerage branches has enabled us to expand our customer service offerings by providing non asset based capabilities to our customers when the shipments do not fit our asset based model 
the development of our brokerage model strengthens our relationships with our customers because it provides our customers with more options and complements our existing dry van and temperature controlled truckload carrier services 
our brokerage model is also a less capital intensive way for us to grow our business 
the expansion of our services represents our continued progression as we build our brand as the premier national carrier  providing local service to the markets we serve 

table of contents revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
the most significant expenses in our business include fuel  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and depreciation of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and service centers and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  net income decreased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share decreased to from 
in comparison to prior years  represented one of the most difficult operating environments for the execution of our business model based on leading growth and profitability 
for the second consecutive year  a strong peak shipping season did not materialize 
the industry wide supply of truckload equipment continued to outpace the freight demand  which pressured pricing and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
with a decrease in revenue per total miles and lower average miles per tractor  our average revenue per tractor per week decreased  to  in from  in our empty mileage factor for the year increased slightly to in  from in our average length of haul decreased to miles during  from miles in the difficult freight market  rising fuel costs  increased insurance and claims expense  and softer market for used tractors and trailers all contributed to a decrease in profitability in at december   our balance sheet reflected million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  no debt  and shareholders equity of million 
for the year  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for net capital expenditures 
our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
see off balance sheet transactions below for a description of our off balance sheet transactions 
trends and outlook in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our tractor count by approximately units 
for the year ended  we increased our fleet by tractors from in this challenging environment  we will manage our fleet size carefully and consider internal growth or contraction of our tractor fleet as events unfold 
in the near term  we expect revenue growth to come primarily from our brokerage business 
in addition  we have ramped up our efforts to identify acquisitions or other investment opportunities that may offer a strategic advantage 
over the long term  we are optimistic about our competitive position in the industry and expect that proper execution of our decentralized growth model will position us to emerge from the downturn with the ability to add more capacity and gain more market share 
further because of our brokerage business  we are able to add customers without adding tractor capacity 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period

net fuel expense including fuel surcharge 
a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the relatively high fuel cost variability makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  up from million in the increase is primarily due to the opening of eight brokerage branches and four asset based service centers in our average tractor fleet increased to  tractors in  from  tractors in the industry wide supply of truckload equipment outpaced demand throughout  and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
declines in both revenue per mile and miles per tractor contributed to a decline in average freight revenue per tractor per week  to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our tractor fleet by approximately tractors from the third quarter of we ended with  tractors  an increase of tractors from a year ago 
salaries  wages and benefits expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in  from in the increase in fuel expense is due to the combination of rising fuel costs and fuel mileage degradation caused by the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 
the us national average diesel fuel prices increased approximately per gallon in from we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
we were able to off set a portion of the rising fuel cost due to improvements in 
table of contents fuel surcharge revenue 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely affect our operating expenses throughout operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in the increase is a result of lower revenue per mile 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for the increase is mainly due to the settlement of certain prior year claims in amounts greater than previously anticipated 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for from for the increase is mainly due to lower revenue per mile 
communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for the reduction in communications expense is due to contractual rate changes 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in the increase is a result of lower revenue per mile and lower miles per tractor 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased the estimated salvage value of our tractors and trailers from to  which partially off set the increase in depreciation expense in lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained at for both and as of december  we had tractors under operating leases 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for the increase in this expense is primarily a result of the growth of our brokerage business 
excluding purchased transportation expense from our brokerage division  this expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  would have decreased to in  compared to for as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment decreased nearly  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for the years ended december  and as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other income expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to less than for in we recorded a  impairment charge relating to our investment in transportation resource partners  which reduced our net interest and other income to less than for we had no outstanding debt at december  or income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  up from million in this increase is due to a combination of fleet expansion associated with the opening of four dry van and one refrigerated regional service centers  and our purchase of most of the trucking assets of roads west  as well as increased revenue per mile and the growth of our brokerage operations 
revenue generated from roads west accounted for approximately million of the total million increase 
as a result of the expansion  including the roads west acquisition  our tractor fleet grew to  tractors including owned by independent contractors for  up from  tractors in the growth in the fleet  along with a increase in average revenue per total mile  resulted in a significant period over period improvement in freight revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor  a increase in our percentage of non revenue miles  and a decrease in average revenue per tractor per week in compared to salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in the increase is due to the combination of driver pay rate increases implemented in  and a non cash equity based compensation expense of approximately million for  which expense was not recorded for years prior to for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
due to fewer injury claims in fiscal year  our workers compensation expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in this was mainly due to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which offset higher fuel prices 
we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to in  compared to in  as a result of higher fuel prices 
operations and maintenance expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in the average age of our equipment and the increase in routine service and maintenance completed at our regional service centers 
the average age of our company tractors and trailers at the end of was years and years  respectively  compared to years and years  respectively  in in addition  increased revenue per mile also contributed to a reduction in operations and maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for the decrease is due to better claims experience and lower claims costs in increased revenue per mile also improved this primarily mileage based expense as a percentage of revenue 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased slightly to for from for the decrease is mainly due to improved revenue per mile 
communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for this slight increase is due to the implementation of new equipment tracking devices  for which we incur monthly service fees 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in this slight increase is due to the growth in the percentage of our fleet that is owned by us as opposed to owned by independent contractors 
effective october   we increased the estimated salvage value of our tractors and trailers from to 
this decision was made during our routine  period review when we determined that the salvage values of our tractors and trailers was higher than originally expected 
this determination was further based upon i favorable market conditions in equipment sales  ii a guaranteed re purchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii a decrease in the average miles driven on the equipment being sold 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million for the fiscal year excluding the impact of this change in accounting estimate  depreciation expense for would have been of revenue before fuel surcharge 
this increase is due to the growth in the percentage of our fleet that is company owned  compared to our fleet that is operated by independent contractors 

table of contents lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to essentially zero for prior to the acquisition of edwards bros  inc in the third quarter of  we owned all of our revenue equipment and therefore did not incur lease expense for most of at year end  we had tractors under operating leases 
purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for the increase in this category is primarily due to payments to outside carriers for transportation services arranged by our brokerage division  which began operations in the third quarter of excluding purchased transportation expense from our brokerage division  this expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  would have decreased to in  compared to for this decrease is attributed to a lower percentage of owner operator tractors being operated during as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for gains from sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to additional expenditures related to technology improvements  consulting and professional fees  and higher allowance for doubtful accounts 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest income as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for the average rate of return on our cash and short term investments increased more than basis points from to we had no outstanding debt at december  or other expense for was comprised of a  impairment charge relating to our investment in transportation resource partners trp 
other income for was comprised of  gains resulting from the sale of our investment in concentrek  inc  along with a  impairment charge relating to our investment in trp 
income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to hurricane tax credits  investment tax credits  and job creation and retention credits recognized in the decrease in the effective income tax rate was offset by an increase in income before tax  resulting in income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  of for both and as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  and to a lesser extent lease financing arrangements  issuances of stocks  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease for is mainly due to lower net income and an increase in our short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease is mainly due to a reduction in capital expenditures for revenue equipment in capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of equipment sales and trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in 
table of contents we spent approximately million relating to the acquisition of the roads west equipment 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately to million for we expect these capital expenditures will be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately million for the year ended the change primarily consisted of a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a million increase in dividends paid to common stock shareholders during compared to we increased our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share in the second quarter of at december   we had no outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit agreement and were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments was million  compared to million as of december  in october  we used cash to acquire most of the trucking assets of roads west  which accounted for the low cash balance at december  we believe that we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash flows from operations and borrowing available under our existing line of credit 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we had tractors held under operating leases with varying termination dates ranging from january to august future operating lease commitments for revenue equipment  as of december   were  with  due in the next months 
the effective annual interest rate for these operating leases is 
lease payments with respect to such vehicles are reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to revenue equipment leases was   and  for the periods ended december    and  respectively 
we also use operating leases to lease locations for certain of our terminal facilities and for temporary trailer storage 
these operating leases have termination dates ranging from january through december rental payments for such terminal facilities and trailer storage are reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the line item miscellaneous operating expenses 
rental payments for our terminal facilities and trailer storage was million for the periods ended december  and  and million for the period ended december  
table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses and other commitments 
payments in millions due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other purchase obligations revenue equipment investment in transportation resource partners operating leases revenue equipment operating leases terminal building fin obligations  including interest and penalties total our purchase commitments for revenue equipment are currently under negotiation 
upon execution of the purchase commitments  we anticipate that purchase commitments under contract will have a net purchase price of approximately million and will be paid throughout fin obligations represent potential liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions 
we are uncertain when this liability will be settled 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consulting with experts  and using other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from three to years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used revenue equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
on october   we increased the estimated salvage value of our tractors and trailers from to 
this decision was made during our routine  periodic review when we determined that the salvage value of our tractors and trailers was higher than originally expected 
this determination was further based upon i favorable market conditions in equipment sales  ii a guaranteed re purchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii a decrease in the average miles driven on the equipment being sold 
future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuation in market value that is not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect in our results of operations 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present that indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss 

table of contents claims accrual 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves are adjusted quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim  historical trends  advice from third party administrators and insurers  the specific facts of individual cases  the jurisdictions involved  estimates of future claims development  and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  our profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention  we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed our coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount 
our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  as amended 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management judgment also is required regarding a variety of other factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on our future performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  further information related to the implementation is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based payments 
we have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
management judgment is required to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model and management bases such decisions on historical data 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined almost entirely to the united states  we are not subject to a material foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
we believe that the majority of the fuel price increases are generally passed to our customers
