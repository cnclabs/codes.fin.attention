overview we are a national provider of specialty pharmacy and disease management services focused on hiv aids patients 
we sell hiv aids medications  ancillary drugs and nutritional supplies under our trade name moms pharmacy 
we work closely with physicians  nurses  clinics and asos  and with government and private payors  to improve clinical outcomes and reduce treatment costs for our patients 
most of our patients rely on medicaid and other state administered programs  such as adap  to pay for their hiv aids medications 
we believe that the combination of services we offer to patients  healthcare providers and payors makes us an attractive source of specialty pharmacy and disease management services  contributes to better clinical outcomes and reduces overall healthcare costs 
our services include the following specialized momspak prescription packaging that helps reduce patient error associated with complex multi drug regimens  which require multiple drugs to be taken at varying doses and schedules  reimbursement experience which assists patients and healthcare providers with the complex reimbursement processes and optimizes collection of payment  arrangement for the timely delivery of medications in a discreet and convenient manner as directed by our patients or their physicians  specialized pharmacists who consult with patients  physicians  nurses and asos to provide education  counseling  treatment coordination  clinical information and compliance monitoring  and information systems and prescription automation solutions that make the provision of clinical data and the transmission of prescriptions more efficient and accurate 
we have grown our business primarily by acquiring other specialty pharmacies and expanding our existing business 
in december  we opened our first satellite pharmacy in oakland  california 
since the beginning of  we have acquired seven specialty pharmacies in california and two specialty pharmacies in new york 
we also generate internal growth primarily by increasing the number of patients we serve and filling more prescriptions per patient in our existing locations 
we will continue to evaluate acquisitions and expand our existing business as opportunities arise or circumstances warrant 
on march   we signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire of the stock of biomed for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
biomed is a leading provider of specialized biopharmaceutical medications 
table of contents and services to chronically ill patients 
under the definitive merger agreement  we will pay biomed s stockholders an aggregate of million in cash and issue a total of million shares of our common and preferred stock valued at approximately million 
we will also assume up to million of biomed s debt 
in addition  we may make an earn out payment in if biomed achieves certain financial performance benchmarks during the first months after closing 
we expect to pay the purchase price with funds from a new senior credit facility  available cash and newly issued common stock and preferred stock 
the closing will be subject to government approval and is expected to close within days 
geographic footprint 
we operate our business as a single reporting segment configured to serve key geographic areas 
as of december   we operated eleven distribution centers  strategically located in california seven separate locations  new york two separate locations  florida and washington to serve major metropolitan areas where high concentrations of hiv aids patients reside 
in discussing our results of operations  we address changes in the net sales contributed by each of these regional distribution centers because we believe this provides a meaningful indication of the historical performance of our business 
we ceased operating our austin  texas distribution center as of june  a significant portion of the operations of that distribution center was dedicated to serving organ transplant and oncology patients 
consistent with our strategy of focusing on the hiv aids market  we decided not to continue this business 
we did not record any material expense associated with the discontinuance of these operations and closing that facility 
in  our austin  texas distribution center contributed approximately  of net sales to our financial results 
as a result of our decision to discontinue our texas operations  we have presented the results of the texas distribution center as discontinued operations 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  we have restated prior periods to reflect the presentation of the texas facility as discontinued operations  so that period to period results are comparable 
net sales 
as of december   approximately of our net sales came from payments directly from government sources such as medicaid  adap  and medicare excluding part d  described below  which is administered through private payor sources 
these are all highly regulated government programs subject to frequent changes and cost containment measures 
we continually monitor changes in reimbursement for hiv aids medications 
on december   the mma was signed into law 
this legislation made significant structural changes to the federal medicare program  including the establishment of a new medicare part d outpatient prescription drug program 
effective january   medicaid coverage of prescription drugs for medicaid beneficiaries who were also eligible for medicare transitioned to the medicare program 
these beneficiaries  referred to as dual eligibles  are now enrolled in the medicare pdps 
we have agreements in the geographic regions we serve with most of these pdps to provide prescription drugs to our dual eligible patients 
typically  the pdps provide a lower reimbursement rate than the rates we received from the medicaid programs 
in december and  approximately and of our patients  respectively  received coverage under a pdp 
gross profit 
our gross profit reflects net sales less the cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold is the cost of pharmaceutical products we purchase from wholesalers 
the amount that we are reimbursed by government and private payors has historically increased as the price of the pharmaceuticals we purchase has increased 
however  as a result of cost containment initiatives prevalent in the healthcare industry  private and government payors have reduced reimbursement rates  which prevents us from recovering the full amount of any price increases 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are made up of both variable and fixed costs 
our principal variable costs  which increase as net sales increase  are labor and delivery 
our principal fixed costs  which do not vary directly with changes in net sales  are facilities  equipment and insurance 
while we believe that we now have a sufficient revenue base to continue to operate profitably given our current level of operating and other expenses  our business remains subject to uncertainties and potential changes that could result in losses 
in particular  changes to reimbursement rates  unexpected increases in operating expenses  difficulty integrating acquisitions or declines in the number of patients we serve or the number of prescriptions we fill could adversely affect our future results 
for a further discussion regarding these uncertainties and potential changes  see item a

critical accounting policies management believes that the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies  which the sec defines as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because management must make estimates about uncertain and changing matters 
our critical accounting policies affect the amount of income and expense we record in each period  as well as the value of our assets and liabilities and our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities 
in 
table of contents applying these critical accounting policies  we make estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements that  if made differently  could have a positive or negative effect on our financial results 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and appropriate  in light of applicable accounting rules 
however  estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ materially from estimates 
we discuss these and other significant accounting policies related to our continuing operations in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in
