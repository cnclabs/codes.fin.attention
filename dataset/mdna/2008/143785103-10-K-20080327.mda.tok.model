item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have no material operations and conduct no business on our own other than owning our subsidiaries  carolina bank and carolina capital trust  and because carolina capital trust has no operations other than the issuance of its trust preferred securities  the discussion contained in this management s discussion and analysis concerns primarily the business of carolina bank 
however  for ease of reading and because the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis  carolina bank holdings and carolina bank are collectively referred to herein as we  our  or us  unless otherwise noted 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations and business 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information available at the time these statements and disclosures were prepared 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expected include the following general economic conditions may deteriorate and negatively impact the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and our depositors to maintain balances 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
competitive pressures among financial institutions may increase 
legislative or regulatory changes  including changes in accounting standards  may adversely affect the businesses that we are engaged in 
new products developed and new methods of delivering products could result in a reduction in our business and income 
adverse changes may occur in the securities market 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include our accounting for the allowance for loan losses 
our accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses involve the use of estimates and require significant judgment 
these estimates are based on our opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on available information including the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses  specific impaired loans  availability and quality of collateral  age of the various portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
different assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses could result in material changes in our consolidated financial condition or consolidated financial results of operations 
the methodology we employ to determine the allowance for loan losses involves a number of assumptions and estimates about uncertain matters 
we periodically review our assumptions and methodology

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses our ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
our primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and cash flows generated from operations 
external sources of funds include increases in deposits  repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased from banks and advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
carolina bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain specified levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of investments 
cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities available for sale are the primary liquid assets of carolina bank 
we regularly monitor carolina bank s liquidity position to ensure its liquidity is sufficient to meet its needs 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking regulatory agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
as of december  and  our levels of capital exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements

provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses  established through charges to expense in the form of a provision for loan losses  allows for known and expected loan losses in our loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses decreased in to  from  in  primarily because watch list loans and related loan loss reserves declined in watch list loans still accrue interest but generally require higher loan loss reserves due to greater risk or declining credit quality 
the level of the allowance for loan losses is based on our estimate as to the amount required to maintain an allowance adequate enough to provide for known and expected losses 
we consider  among other things  nonperforming loans  watch list loans  delinquencies  collateral value  loss trends  and general economic conditions when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of loans held for investment and million or of loans at december  and  respectively 
the lower allowance at december  was due to fewer watch list loans and greater growth during in the types of loans that require lower loan loss allowances

asset quality is a primary concern of our credit administration 
a thorough credit analysis is made of most loans before origination

we have established loan and credit policies designed to control both the types and amounts of risks assumed and to ultimately minimize credit losses 
such policies include limitations on loan to collateral values for various types of collateral  requirements for appraisals of certain real estate collateral  problem loan management practices and collection procedures  and non accrual and charge off guidelines 
loans secured by real estate mortgages comprised and of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
residential real estate loans consist mainly of first and second mortgages on single family homes 
loan to value ratios for these loans are generally limited to for second mortgages and for first mortgages  unless private mortgage insurance is obtained 
nonresidential loans are secured by business and commercial properties with loan to value ratios generally limited to 
the repayment of both residential and nonresidential real estate loans is dependent primarily on the income and cash flows of the borrowers with the real estate serving as a secondary source of repayment 
real estate construction loans generally consist of financing of commercial real estate projects and some one to four family dwellings 
usually the loan to cost ratios are limited to  and permanent financing commitments are generally required prior to advancing loan proceeds 
commercial loans primarily represent loans to businesses and may be made on either a secured or unsecured basis 
commercial lending involves risk because repayment usually depends on the cash flows generated by a borrower s business  and the debt service capacity of a business can deteriorate because of downturns in national and local economic conditions 
to manage this risk  initial and continuing financial analysis of a borrower s financial information is generally required 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by direct charges to operating expense 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which management has determined that such loans have become uncollectible 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 

table of contents our allowance for loan losses is composed of two parts  a specific portion related to non performing loans and a general section related to performing loans 
the specific portion of our allowance for loan losses  which relates to problem loans  increased slightly to  at december  from  at december  the difference between our allowance for loan losses and the specific portion of the allowance for loan losses was  and  at december  and  respectively 
these allowances apply to performing loans and were determined by applying estimated loss ratios inherent in the loan portfolio  ranging from 
on residential real estate loans to on non secured consumer revolving loans  to categories of performing loans at each period end 
the general section also includes allowances for certain watch list loans which are still performing but carry a higher degree of risk because of declining credit factors 
watch list loans with higher than standard loan loss allowances decreased to million at december  from million at december  with related allowances declining to  from  a summary of our loan loss experience for the years ended december  and is presented under the previous section  provision for loan losses

table of contents non performing loans 
when a loan is past due days as to interest or principal or there is serious doubt as to collectability  the accrual of interest is generally discontinued unless the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to assure the collection of the principal balance and accrued interest 
a non accrual loan is not returned to accrual status unless principal and interest are current and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to continue making payments as agreed 
the following table sets forth information on non accrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans  and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans real estate owned total nonperforming assets accruing loans past due days or more allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans to period end loans held for investment allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans nonperforming assets to total assets deposits 
the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more at december  and is presented below 
such deposits may be more volatile and interest rate sensitive than other deposits 
certificates of deposit in amounts of  or more at december  remaining maturity dollars in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of re pricing assets compared to liabilities and is a part of asset liability management 
it is the objective of interest rate sensitivity management to generate stable growth in net interest income  and to control the risks associated with interest rate movements 
we measure interest rate risk by using simulation analysis 
simulation analysis indicates  in the absence of growth or changes in the mix of assets and liabilities  our net interest income generally increases when short term interest rates rise and declines when short term interest rates fall 
we have become more balanced in our asset liability position over the past two years due to growth in our money market accounts which can re price immediately upon changes in short term interest rates as do approximately of our loans which mostly change with the prime rate 
while the net yield on interest earning assets was stable at for and  we experienced a decline to in this ratio for the fourth quarter of although the decline in short term interest rates was the major reason for the net yield decrease in the fourth quarter  lower deposit pricing lagged the general interest rate trends in our market place and resulted in more net yield degradation than normal 

table of contents the table below reflects the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at the earlier of their re pricing or maturity dates 
investment security prepayments and calls are estimated based on current interest rates and could vary significantly if interest rates change 
fixed rate loans are reflected at their contractual maturity date and variable loans are reflected when the loans may be re priced contractually 
interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as interest bearing transaction accounts and savings deposits are reflected in the earliest re pricing interval due to contractual arrangements which give the bank the opportunity to vary rates paid on these deposits within a thirty day or shorter period 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions

carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy standards 
under these standards  financial institutions are required to maintain minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets and average total assets 
carolina bank holdings  inc and carolina bank exceeded all minimum capital requirements and met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized at december  and included in our regulatory capital  is million in junior subordinated debentures which has been primarily invested in the bank 
inflation 
since our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  our performance is more affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not necessarily be the same 
while the effect of inflation on a financial institution is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and financial institutions will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses
