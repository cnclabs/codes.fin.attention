the company operates in one line of business  electronic manufacturing services ems 
sparton s capabilities range from product design and development through aftermarket support  specializing in total business solutions for government  medical scientific instrumentation  aerospace and industrial markets 
this includes the design  development and or manufacture of electronic parts and assemblies for both government and commercial customers worldwide 
governmental sales are mainly sonobuoys 
the private securities litigation reform act of reflects congress determination that the disclosure of forward looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the scope of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the words expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  will  shall  and similar expressions  and the negatives of such expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  any statements which refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly disclose any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring subsequent to filing this form k with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those discussed below 
accordingly  sparton s future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low to medium volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact our operating results if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  foreign currency exchange rate risk  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation  and uncertainties related to defects discovered in certain of the company s aerospace circuit boards 
further risk factors are the availability and cost of materials 
a number of events can impact these risks and uncertainties  including potential escalating utility and other related costs due to natural disasters  as well as political uncertainties such as the conflict in iraq 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components due to strong market demand  this resulted in higher prices and or late deliveries 
additionally  the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to the test range and successful passage of product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and less frequent than in the past 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of required changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and new york stock exchange nyse also passed rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs  and it is expected that certain of these costs will continue indefinitely 
a further discussion of the company s risk factors has been included in part i  item a  risk factors of this report 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 

table of contents executive summary fiscal results were favorably impacted by consistent and successful sonobuoy drop tests contributing to increased sales and improved margins 
continued sales growth in the medical scientific instrumentation market and a number of significant new ems program orders now in start up 
improved margins from a better product mix  improved performance  and repricing on some products 
the completion of the sale of the deming  new mexico facility at a gain of approximately million 
these factors  however  were offset by valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets of approximately million 
sales of several lots of sonobuoys in the early part of fiscal  which contracts carried minimal or no margin 
these programs are now essentially complete 
significant new program start up costs related to hiring staff  training personnel and the costs of ordering material in advance of production  compounded by customer delays which lead to further unexpected cost growth 
increased selling and administrative expenses to support new program start ups 
decreased sales and depressed margins in the industrial other market  due primarily to reduced sales and pricing concessions to one customer 
the write off of a million litigation claim previously recorded as a deferred asset  due to an adverse court opinion 
increased outside service costs related to management s obligation to report for the first time on internal control over financial reporting at the end of this fiscal year 
costs in advance of closing the albuquerque  new mexico facility related to severance benefits reduced gross margins by approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal reserve established against previously deferred costs of million 
these various factors  among others  are further discussed below 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales of total sales of total change medical scientific instrumentation aerospace government industrial other totals sales for the year ended june  totaled  an increase of  or from fiscal medical scientific instrumentation sales increased  or  above sales from the prior year 
this increase is partially due to new customer programs and expanded sales to the existing customer base 
the majority of the increase was due to three existing customers  whose combined increased volume contributed  to the overall increase 
in addition  one new customer contributed  medical scientific instrumentation sales are expected to continue to expand 
aerospace sales were also up from prior year   or primarily due to the increased volume of sales to two existing customers who  combined  contributed  to the increase 
government sales in fiscal increased due to the results of successful sonobuoy drop tests  increasing  or  from the prior year 
however  industrial other sales declined  or 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales to two existing customers  which accounted for a combined decrease of  during the year ended june  we are uncertain at this time as to the level of future sales to these two customers 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales to other customers 
the majority of the company s sales come from a small number of customers

gross profit varies from period to period and can be affected by a number of factors  including product mix  production efficiencies  capacity utilization  and costs associated with new program introduction  all of which impacted fiscal s performance 
during the year ended june   gross profit was favorably impacted by improved margins on several customers  a result of pricing increases and improved performance 
in addition  successful sonobuoy drop tests allowed for significantly improved government sales  as well as an increased margin associated with those sales 
however  these improvements were partially offset by price concessions granted to one industrial customer  which reduced margins by approximately  on similar sales in the prior year

in addition  we have incurred and expensed approximately million in start up related costs for approximately ten new programs at several facilities

a significant portion of the change  approximately  was due to increased 
table of contents wages  related benefits  and employee activity at one facility resulting from the support and start up activity related to new customers and increased sales within the medical scientific instrumentation market 
in addition  approximately  of higher than normal outside service costs were incurred for assistance with compliance with the company s obligation to report on internal control over financial reporting  which commenced with the year ended june  beginning in fiscal  the company was required to expense the vested portion of the fair value of stock options 
for the years ended june  and   or and  or of the total  and  respectively  was included in selling and administrative expenses  with the balance of these noncash charges reflected in costs of goods sold 
the remaining increase was due to additional increases in various categories  such as wages  employee benefits  insurance  regulatory compliance and other items  many of which increased due to support needed for the large number of job starts under way and increased sales activity 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal the majority of the decrease in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  was due to the significant increase in sales in the year ended june  without a corresponding increase in expenses

the company s investment in cybernet is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company s effective tax rate benefit for fiscal was compared to the statutory us federal tax rate of 
the significant increase in the effective tax rate was due to the valuation allowance of approximately million recorded in the current year

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been generated from operations 
certain government contracts provide for interim progress billings based on costs incurred 
these progress billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the performance of these contracts 
as the volume of us defense related contract work has declined over the past several years  so has the relative importance of progress billings as a liquidity resource 
in addition  short term liquid investments or borrowings on the company s line of credit facility have been used to provide additional working capital 
during fiscal  the company liquidated a portion of its investment securities to fund the company s  stock repurchase program

for the fiscal year ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  operating activities used  in fiscal and  in fiscal in net cash flows 
the primary use of cash from operating activities in fiscal was the increase in inventories and accounts receivable  as well as funding operating losses

the primary source of cash in fiscal reflected in the cash flow statement was the increase in accounts payable primarily due to the increase in inventories to support new job starts 
the primary use of cash in fiscal was for operations  combined with an increase in inventory

the primary uses of cash from financing activities in fiscal and was the repayment of debt incurred with the purchase of sms  as well as the repurchase of common stock in fiscal historically  the company s market risk exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rates on third party receivables and payables was not considered to be material  principally due to their short term nature and the minimal amount of receivables and payables designated in foreign currency 
however  due to the recently strengthened canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains on intercompany activity and balances has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected

finally  there are notes payable totaling million outstanding to the former owners of astro  as well as million of industrial revenue bonds

a majority of the june   backlog is expected to be realized in the next months 
commercial ems orders are not included in the backlog 
the company does not believe the amount of commercial activity covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales  as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled without significant penalty

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of sparton s board of directors 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
in addition  estimated total contract costs can be significantly affected by changing test routines and procedures  resulting design modifications and production rework from these changing test routines and procedures  and limited range access for testing these design modifications and rework solutions 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change  sometimes significantly  as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts at least quarterly and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories require a significant degree of judgment 
these allowances are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring 
table of contents materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
as of june  and the valuation allowances totaled  and  respectively 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for probable losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customer s financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for probable losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts considered necessary was  and  at june  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant  have generally not exceeded management s expectations  and the minimal allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of sfas no 
are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
during the quarter ended march   the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan was completed 
based on this valuation  net periodic pension expense for fiscal was calculated to be  compared to  for fiscal an additional  settlement adjustment was identified and recognized in fiscal in connection with lump sum benefit distributions 
these lump sum distributions were made over the last several years 
substantially all plan participants elect to receive their retirement benefit payments in the form of lump sum settlements 
the total adjustment of  was recorded in fiscal the amount related to prior years was immaterial to the financial results of each of the years affected 
the settlement adjustment resulted from several business and economic factors that have affected the measurement of the plan s projected benefit obligation in recent years  including changes in the plan s benefit formula  the timing of participants retirement  changes in assumed interest rates  variation in investment returns  and the amounts of lump sum distributions paid 
the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
a pension contribution of  was made during fiscal 
table of contents on june   the company adopted the balance sheet recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement required sparton to recognize the funded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of its plan in the june  consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs remaining from the initial adoption of sfas no 
 all of which were previously netted against the plan s funded status in sparton s balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
upon adoption  sparton recorded an after tax  unrecognized loss in the amount of  which represents an increase directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss as of june  these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic plan expenses pursuant to sparton s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods  and that are not recognized as net periodic plan expenses in the same periods  will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on sparton s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june   or for any prior period presented  and it will not affect sparton s operating results in future periods 
business combinations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company allocated the purchase price of its may sms acquisition to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates  judgments and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management arrived at estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired business and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected discounted cash flows from customer relationships and contracts assuming similar product platforms and completed projects  the acquired company s market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired customer relationships will continue to generate revenue streams  and attrition and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results  particularly with respect to amortization periods assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
valuation of property  plant and equipment sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that the company record an impairment charge on our investment in property  plant and equipment that we hold and use in our operations if and when management determines that the related carrying values may not be recoverable 
if one or more impairment indicators are deemed to exist  sparton will measure any impairment of these assets based on current independent appraisals or a projected discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated operating results and are subject to many factors 
the most recent such impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge 
goodwill and customer relationships the company annually reviews goodwill associated with its investments in cybernet and sms for possible impairment 
this analysis may be performed more often should events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on intangible assets 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then management will perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  require impairment testing of an amortized intangible whenever indicators are present that an impairment of the asset may exist 
if an impairment of the asset is determined to exist  the impairment is recognized and the asset is written down to its fair value  which value then becomes the new amortizable base 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment is prohibited 

table of contents determining the fair value of any reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and  if appropriate  determination of appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of the company s reporting units 
the most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis related to the company s cybernet and sms investments was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal that impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
the next such impairment reviews are expected to be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal deferred costs and claims for reimbursement in the normal course of business  the company from time to time incurs costs and or seeks related reimbursements or recovery claims from third parties 
such amounts  when recovery is considered probable  are generally reported as other non current assets 
nevertheless  uncertainty is usually present in making these assessments and if the company is not ultimately successful in recovering these recorded amounts  there could be a material impact on operating results in any one fiscal period 
see other assets in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
income taxes our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred income tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid or received on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
the recorded net deferred income tax assets  while reduced during fiscal by a significant valuation allowance  are subject to an ongoing assessment of their recovery  and our realization of these recorded benefits is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income within the united states 
if future levels of taxable income are not consistent with our expectations  we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance  which could reduce net income by a material amount 
detailed information on income taxes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item other matters change of executive officers on march   the company s former president and chief executive officer  david w

litigation one of sparton s facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico  has been the subject of ongoing investigations conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
at june   sparton has accrued  as its estimate of the future undiscounted minimum financial liability with respect to this matter 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs  which are expensed as incurred  and is anticipated to cover approximately the next years 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for onsite and offsite operations and is based on existing methodology 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally  a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be affected significantly by the impact of the ultimate resolution of this contingency 

table of contents some of the printed circuit boards supplied to the company for its aerospace sales were discovered in fiscal to be nonconforming and defective 
the defect occurred during production at the raw board supplier s facility  prior to shipment to sparton for further processing 
the company and our customer  who received the defective boards  have contained the defective boards 
while investigations are underway  million and million of related product and associated incurred costs have been deferred and classified in sparton s balance sheet within other non current assets as of june  and  respectively 
the change between fiscal and is a result of a million reserve established as of june  in august  sparton electronics florida  inc filed an action in us district court of florida against electropac co  inc and a related party the raw board manufacturer to recover these costs 
a trial in the matter started in august  and the trial court has issued an interim ruling favorable to sparton  however at an amount less than the previously deferred million 
court ordered mediation was conducted following the court s ruling and a potential settlement of the claim is pending  subject to the successful completion of due diligence 
no loss contingency  other than the million reserve described above  has been established at june   as we expect to collect the remaining million in full 
should the mediation  or subsequent court ruling  ultimately be decided less favorably to sparton  or if the defendants are unable to pay the ultimate judgment  our before tax operating results at that time could be adversely affected by up to million 
sparton is currently involved with other legal actions  which are disclosed in part i item legal proceedings  of this report 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome of these claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states  canada  and vietnam 
sales are to the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian and vietnamese financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the domestic and foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal third party receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency and the related market risk exposure is considered to be immaterial 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
however  due to the strengthened canadian dollar in recent years  the impact of transaction and translation gains has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally long term debt associated with the sms acquisition on may  historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the fact that interest rates periodically adjust to market values for the majority of the term debt issued or assumed in the sms acquisition  interest rate risk is not considered to be significant
