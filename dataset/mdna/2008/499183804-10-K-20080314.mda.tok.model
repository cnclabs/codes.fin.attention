item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flows  future financing and flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  including accrued interest  and our stockholders deficit was million 
we pay interest in cash on our credit facilities 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business in a number of ways  including we may have to dedicate a significant amount of our available funding and cash flow from operating activities to the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on outstanding indebtedness  depending on the levels of our outstanding debt and the terms of our debt agreements  we may have trouble obtaining future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes  high levels of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  and increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure 
we may not be able to make future principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
we currently generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to service our indebtedness 
however  our ability to make future principal and interest payments on our debt depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we cannot grow and generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to service our debt payments  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt  sell selected assets  or reduce or delay planned capital expenditures 
these measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
restrictions on our business imposed by our debt agreements could limit our growth or activities 
our credit agreements place operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
these restrictions affect  and any restrictions created by future financings will affect  our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional debt  create or incur liens on our assets  make certain investments  use the proceeds from the sale of assets  pay cash dividends on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock  utilize excess liquidity except for debt reduction  engage in potential mergers and acquisitions  sale leaseback transactions or other fundamental changes in the nature of our business  and make capital expenditures 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios  such as debt to ebitda earnings before income  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda to cash interest 
these limitations may affect our ability to finance our future operations or to engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
if we violate any of these restrictions or any restrictions created by future financings  we could be in default under our agreements and be required to repay our debt immediately rather than at scheduled maturity 
we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully 
we consummated the acquisitions of prairiewave in april  and graceba in january  and are operating in three additional markets 
our future growth and profitability will depend in part on the success of our integration of the acquired operations into our operations 
our ability to successfully integrate such operations will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to devote adequate personnel to the integration process  while still managing our current operations effectively 
we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses  which could increase our costs or adversely impact our ability to operate our business 
future acquisitions and joint ventures could strain our business and resources 
if we acquire existing companies or networks or enter into joint ventures  we may miscalculate the value of the acquired company or joint venture  divert resources and management time  experience difficulties in integrating the acquired business or joint venture with our operations  experience relationship issues  such as with customers  employees and suppliers  as a result of changes in management  incur additional liabilities or obligations as a result of the acquisition or joint venture  and assume additional financial burdens or dilution in connection with the transaction 
additionally  ongoing consolidation in our industry may reduce the number of attractive acquisition targets 
the demand for our bundled broadband communications services may be lower than we expect 
the demand for video  voice and data services  either alone or as part of a bundle  cannot readily be determined 
our business could be adversely affected if demand for bundled broadband communications services is materially lower than we expect 
if the markets for the services we offer  including voice and data services  fail to develop  grow more slowly than anticipated or become saturated with competitors  our ability to generate revenue will suffer 
competition from other providers of video services could adversely affect our results of operations 
to be successful  we will need to retain our existing video customers and attract video customers away from our competitors 
some of our competitors have advantages over us  such as long standing customer relationships  larger networks  and greater experience  resources  marketing capabilities and name recognition 
in addition  a continuing trend toward business combinations and alliances in the cable television area and in the telecommunications industry as a whole as well as changes in the regulatory environment facilitating entry for additional providers of video service may result in the emergence of significant new competitors for us 
in providing video service  we currently compete with bright house  charter  comcast  mediacom  midcontinent and time warner 
we also compete with satellite television providers  including directv and echostar 
legislation now allows satellite television providers to offer local broadcast television stations 
this may reduce our current advantage over satellite television providers and our ability to attract and maintain customers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the providers of video services in our markets have  from time to time  adopted promotional discounts 
we expect these promotional discounts in our markets to continue into the foreseeable future and additional promotional discounts may be adopted 
we may need to offer additional promotional discounts to be competitive  which could have an adverse impact on our revenues 
in addition  incumbent local phone companies may market video services in their service areas to provide a bundle of services 
as telephone service providers offer video services in our markets  it could increase our competition for our video and voice services and for our bundled services 
competition from other providers of voice services could adversely affect our results of operations 
in providing local and long distance telephone services  we compete with the incumbent local phone company in each of our markets 
we are not the first provider of telephone services in most of our markets and we therefore must attract customers away from other telephone companies 
at t  qwest and verizon are the primary incumbent local exchange carriers in our targeted region 
they offer both local and long distance services in our markets and are particularly strong competitors 
in the future  we may face other competitors  such as cable television service operators who have announced their intention to offer telephone services with internet based telephony 
if cable operators offer voice services in our markets  it could increase competition for our bundled services 
other wireline based carriers also compete with us for voice services  including competitive local exchange carriers and voip service providers 
competition from other providers of data services could adversely affect our results of operations 
providing data services is a rapidly growing business and competition is increasing in each of our markets 
some of our competitors have advantages over us  such as greater experience  resources  marketing capabilities and name recognition 
in providing data services  we compete with traditional dial up internet service providers  incumbent local exchange carriers that provide dial up and digital subscriber line dsl services  providers of satellite based internet access services  competitive local exchange carriers  and cable television companies 
in addition  some providers of data services have reduced prices and engaged in aggressive promotional activities 
we expect these price reductions and promotional activities to continue into the foreseeable future and additional price reductions may be adopted 
we may need to lower our prices for data services to remain competitive and this could adversely affect our results of operations 
our programming costs are increasing  which could reduce our gross profit 
programming has been our largest single operating expense and we expect this to continue 
in recent years  the cable industry has experienced rapid increases in the cost of programming  particularly sports programming 
our relatively small base of subscribers limits our ability to negotiate lower programming costs 
we expect these increases to continue  and we may not be able to pass our programming cost increases on to our customers 
in addition  as we increase the channel capacity of our systems and add programming to our expanded basic and digital programming tiers  we may face additional market constraints on our ability to pass programming costs on to our customers 
any inability to pass programming cost increases on to our customers would have an adverse impact on our gross profit 
see legislation and regulation federal regulation regulation of cable services program access for more information 

table of contents 
index to financial statements programming exclusivity in favor of our competitors could adversely affect the demand for our video services 
we obtain our programming by entering into contracts or arrangements with programming suppliers 
a programming supplier could enter into an exclusive arrangement with one of our video competitors that could create a competitive advantage for that competitor by restricting our access to this programming 
if our ability to offer popular programming on our cable television systems is restricted by exclusive arrangements between our competitors and programming suppliers  the demand for our video services may be adversely affected and our cost to obtain programming may increase 
see legislation and regulation federal regulation regulation of cable services program access for more information 
the rates we pay for pole attachments may increase significantly 
the rates we must pay utility companies for space on their utility poles is the subject of frequent disputes 
if the rates we pay for pole attachments were to increase significantly or unexpectedly  it would cause our network to be more expensive to operate 
it could also place us at a competitive disadvantage with video and telecommunications service providers who do not require  or who are less dependent upon  pole attachments  such as satellite providers and wireless voice service providers 
see legislation and regulation federal regulation regulation of cable services pole attachments for more information 
loss of interconnection arrangements could impair our telephone service 
we rely on other companies to connect our local telephone customers with customers of other local telephone providers 
we presently have access to at t s telephone network under a nine state interconnection agreement  which expires on december we have access to verizon s telephone network in florida under an interconnection agreement covering florida  which expires november  we continue to exchange traffic with verizon in florida through an existing interconnection arrangement currently subject to the rates  terms  and conditions of the terminated agreement 
we are currently engaged in the process of adopting a new interconnection agreement with verizon 
if the at t agreement is not renewed or terminated  or a new verizon agreement is not executed  we could be adversely affected and our interconnection arrangements could be on terms less favorable than those we receive currently 
it is generally expected that the telecommunications act of will continue to undergo considerable interpretation and implementation  which could have a negative impact on our interconnection agreements with at t and verizon 
it is also possible that further amendments to the communications act of may be enacted which could have a negative impact on our interconnection agreements with at t and verizon 
the contractual arrangements for interconnection and access to unbundled network elements with incumbent carriers generally contain provisions for incorporation of changes in governing law 
thus  future fcc  state public service commission and or court decisions may negatively impact the rates  terms and conditions of the interconnection services we have obtained and may seek to obtain under these agreements  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to compete successfully in the provision of services will depend on the nature and timing of any such legislative changes  regulations and interpretations and whether they are favorable to us or to our competitors 
see legislation and regulation for more information 
we could be negatively impacted by future interpretation or implementation of regulations 
the current communications and cable legislation is complex and in many areas sets forth policy objectives to be implemented by regulation at the federal  state  and local levels 
it is generally expected that the communications act of  as amended  the telecommunications act of and implementing regulations and decisions  as well as applicable state laws and regulations  will continue to undergo considerable interpretation and implementation 
regulations that enhance the ability of certain classes of our competitors  or interpretation of existing regulations to the same effect  would adversely affect our competitive position 
it is also 
table of contents 
index to financial statements possible that further amendments to the communications act of and state statutes to which we or our competitors are subject may be enacted 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on the nature and timing of any such legislative changes  regulations  and interpretations and whether they are favorable to us or to our competitors 
see legislation and regulation for more information 
we operate our network under franchises that are subject to non renewal or termination 
our network generally operates pursuant to franchises  permits or licenses typically granted by a municipality or other state or local government controlling the public rights of way 
often  franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material terms of the franchise order or the local franchise authority s regulations 
although none of our existing franchise or license agreements have been terminated  and we have received no threat of such a termination  one or more local authorities may attempt to take such action 
we may not prevail in any judicial or regulatory proceeding to resolve such a dispute 
further  franchises generally have fixed terms and must be renewed periodically 
local franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if they consider either past performance or the prospective operating proposal to be inadequate 
in a number of jurisdictions  local authorities have attempted to impose rights of way fees on providers that have been challenged as violating federal law 
a number of fcc and judicial decisions have addressed the issues posed by the imposition of rights of way fees on competitive local exchange carriers and on video distributors 
to date  the state of the law is uncertain and may remain so for some time 
we may become subject to future obligations to pay local rights of way fees that are excessive or discriminatory 
the local franchising authorities can grant franchises to competitors who may build networks in our market areas 
a recent fcc decision facilitates competitive video entry by limiting the actions that local franchising authorities may take when reviewing applications by new competitors 
local franchise authorities have the ability to impose regulatory constraints or requirements on our business  including those that could materially increase our expenses 
in the past  local franchise authorities have imposed regulatory constraints  by local ordinance or as part of the process of granting or renewing a franchise  on the construction of our network 
they have also imposed requirements on the level of customer service we provide  as well as other requirements 
the local franchise authorities in our markets may also impose regulatory constraints or requirements that may be found to be consistent with applicable law but which could increase our expenses in operating our business 
see legislation and regulation for more information 
we may not be able to obtain telephone numbers for new voice customers in a timely manner 
in providing voice services  we rely on access to numbering resources in order to provide our customers with telephone numbers 
a shortage of or a delay in obtaining new numbers from numbering administrators  as has sometimes been the case for local exchange carriers in the recent past  could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets or enlarge our market share in existing markets 
we may encounter difficulties in implementing and developing new technologies 
we have invested in advanced technology platforms that support advanced communications services and multiple emerging interactive services  such as video on demand  subscriber video on demand  digital video recording  interactive television  ip centrex services and passive optical network services 
we have also invested in our new enterprise management system 
however  existing and future technological implementations and developments may allow new competitors to emerge  reduce our network s competitiveness or require expensive and time consuming upgrades or additional equipment  which may also require the write down of existing equipment 
in addition  we may be required to select in advance one technology over another and may not choose the technology that is the most economic  efficient or attractive to customers 
we may also encounter difficulties in implementing new technologies  products and services and may encounter disruptions in service as a result 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may encounter difficulties expanding into additional markets 
to expand into additional cities we will have to obtain pole attachment agreements  construction permits  telephone numbers  franchises and other regulatory approvals 
delays in entering into pole attachment agreements  receiving the necessary construction permits and conducting the construction itself have adversely affected our schedule in the past and could do so again in the future 
difficulty in obtaining numbering resources may also adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets 
we may face legal or similar resistance from competitors who are already in markets we wish to enter 
for example  a competitor may oppose or delay our video franchise application or our request for pole attachment space 
these difficulties could significantly harm or delay the development of our business in new markets 
see legislation and regulation federal regulation regulation of cable services program access for more information 
we depend on the services of key personnel to implement our strategy 
if we lose the services of our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain other qualified management personnel  we may be unable to implement our strategy 
our business is currently managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel 
we do not have any employment agreements with  nor do we maintain key man life insurance policies on  these or any other employees 
the loss of members of our key management and certain other members of our operating personnel could adversely affect our business 
our ability to manage our anticipated growth depends on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional qualified management personnel 
while we are able to offer competitive compensation to prospective employees  we may still be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining personnel  which could affect our ability to grow effectively and adversely affect our business 
since our business is concentrated in specific geographic locations  our business could be adversely impacted by a depressed economy and natural disasters in these areas 
we provide our services to areas in alabama  florida  georgia  iowa  minnesota  south carolina  south dakota and tennessee  which are in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
a stagnant or depressed economy in the united states and the southeastern or midwestern united states in particular could affect all of our markets and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our communications services 
our network is attached to poles and other structures in our service areas  and our ability to provide service depends on the availability of electric power 
a tornado  hurricane  flood  mudslide or other natural catastrophe in one of these areas could damage our network  interrupt our service and harm our business in the affected area 
in addition  many of our markets are close together  and a single natural catastrophe could damage our network in more than one market 
risks related to relationships with stockholders  affiliates and related parties a small number of stockholders control a significant portion of our stock and could exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  regardless of the wishes of other stockholders 
as of february   gilder  ganon  howe co

farallon capital management  llc  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
donald w 
burton  a member of our board of directors  owned or controlled approximately of our common stock  including shares owned by the burton partnerships  of which donald w 
burton is a general partner 
further  approximately of our outstanding common stock was owned by campbell b 
lanier  iii  the chairman of our board of directors  and members of mr

index to financial statements elect our directors  or effect a merger  sale of assets or other corporate transaction 
the extent of ownership by these stockholders may also discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to acquire us 
this could reduce the value of our stock 
risks related to our common stock if we issue more stock in future offerings  the percentage of our stock that our stockholders own will be diluted 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
we also had outstanding on that date options to purchase  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock our authorized capital stock includes  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  which our board of directors has the authority to issue without further stockholder action 
future stock issuances also will reduce the percentage ownership of our current stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of the common stock 
as a result  our board of directors could issue shares of preferred stock with the right to receive dividends and the assets of the company upon liquidation prior to the holders of the common stock 
the value of our stock could be hurt by substantial price fluctuations 
the value of our common stock could be subject to sudden and material increases and decreases 
the value of our stock could fluctuate in response to our quarterly operating results  changes in our business  changes in the market s perception of our bundled services  changes in the businesses or market perceptions of our competitors  and changes in general market or economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the value of securities of many companies 
these changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the value of our common stock could increase or decrease based on change of this type 
these fluctuations could materially reduce the value of our stock 
fluctuations in the value of our stock will also affect the value of our outstanding warrants and options  which may adversely affect stockholders equity  net income or both

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a fully integrated provider of video  voice  data and advanced communications services to residential and business customers in nine markets in the southeastern united states  as well as two markets in south dakota 
we provide a full suite of video  voice and data services in huntsville and montgomery  alabama  panama city and portions of pinellas county  florida  augusta  columbus and west point  georgia  charleston  south carolina  knoxville  tennessee  and rapid city and sioux falls  south dakota  as well as portions of minnesota and iowa 
our primary business is the delivery of bundled communication services over our own network 
in addition to our bundled package offerings  we sell these services on an unbundled basis 
we have built our business through construction and expansion of our broadband network to offer integrated video  voice and data services  organic growth of connections through increased penetration of services to new marketable homes and our existing customer base  upgrades of acquired networks to introduce expanded broadband services including bundled video  voice and data services  and acquisitions of broadband systems 
the following discussion includes details  highlights and insight into our consolidated financial condition and results of operations  including recent business developments  critical accounting policies  estimates used in preparing the financial statements and other factors that are expected to affect our prospective financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this annual report 
to date  we have experienced operating losses as a result of the expansion of our service territories and the construction of our network 
we expect to continue to focus on increasing our customer base and expanding our broadband operations 
our ability to generate profits will depend in large part on our ability to increase revenues to offset the costs of construction and operation of our business 
during  we completed several key transactions to improve our financial condition and liquidity 
these transactions include the following in april  we completed the million acquisition of prairiewave  which has delivered significant increases in key operating and financial metrics as well as being free cash flow accretive 
we simplified the capital structure and significantly reduced the cost of capital by entering into a million credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to fund the prairiewave transaction and refinance our existing credit facilities 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting estimates described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use estimates to determine our allowance for bad debts 
these estimates are based on historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our delinquent customer accounts receivable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements capitalization of labor and overhead costs 
our business is capital intensive  and a large portion of the capital we have raised to date has been spent on activities associated with building  extending  upgrading and enhancing our network 
as of december  and  the net carrying amount of our property  plant and equipment was approximately million  of total assets  and million  of total assets  respectively 
total capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
costs associated with network construction  network enhancements and initial customer installation are capitalized 
costs capitalized as part of the initial customer installation include materials  direct labor  and certain indirect costs 
these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions 
the costs of disconnecting service at a customer s premise or reconnecting service to a previously installed premise are charged to operating expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred  while equipment replacement and significant enhancements  including replacement of cable drops from the pole to the premise  are capitalized 
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized 
we capitalize direct labor and certain indirect costs using operational data and estimations of capital activity 
we calculate standards for items such as the labor rates  overhead rates and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity 
overhead rates are established based on an estimation of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities 
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead is incurred as a result of specific capital activities  and therefore should be capitalized 
the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor  i direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities  consisting primarily of installation costs  the cost of support personnel that directly assist with capitalizable installation activities  and indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities 
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are reasonable  a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future 
we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies  and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
accounting for asset impairment 
factors we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of our assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner in which we use our assets or significant changes in our overall business strategy  and significant negative industry economic trends 
we perform a goodwill impairment test annually in accordance with sfas no 
on january based on the results of the test  we recorded no impairment loss to our goodwill as of january   and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements significant and subjective estimates 
the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for us to judge the application 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of inventories and investments  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
homes passed and connections we report homes passed as the number of residential and business units  such as single residence homes  apartments and condominium units  passed by our broadband network and listed in our database 
marketable homes passed are homes passed other than those we believe are covered by exclusive arrangements with other providers of competing services 
because we deliver multiple services to our customers  we report the total number of connections for video  voice and data rather than the total number of customers 
we count each video  voice or data purchase as a separate connection 
for example  a single customer who purchases cable television  local telephone and internet access services would count as three connections 
we do not record the purchase of digital video services by an analog video customer as an additional connection 
as we continue to sell bundled services  we expect more of our video customers to purchase voice  data and other enhanced services in addition to basic video services 
accordingly  we expect that our number of voice and data connections will grow faster than our video connections and will represent a higher percentage of our total connections in the future 
revenues our operating revenues are primarily derived from monthly charges for video  voice and internet data services and other services to residential and business customers 
we provide these services over our network 
our products and services involve different types of charges and in some cases a different method of accounting for or recording revenues 
below is a description of our significant sources of revenue video revenues 
our video revenues consist of fixed monthly fees for expanded basic  premium and digital cable television services  as well as fees from pay per view movies  fees for video on demand and events such as boxing matches and concerts that involve a charge for each viewing 
video revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
voice revenues 
our voice revenues consist primarily of fixed monthly fees for local service and enhanced services  such as call waiting  voice mail and measured and flat rate long distance service 
voice revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
data revenues 
our data revenues consist primarily of fixed monthly fees for data service and rental of cable modems 
data revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
providing data services is a rapidly growing business and competition is increasing in each of our markets 
other revenues 
other revenues result principally from broadband carrier services 
other revenues accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our ability to increase the number of our connections and  as a result  our revenues is directly affected by the level of competition we face in each of our markets with respect to each of our service offerings in providing video services  we currently compete with at t  bright house  charter  comcast  mediacom  midcontinent communications and time warner 
we also compete with satellite television providers such as directv and echostar 
our other competitors include broadcast television stations and other satellite television companies 
we expect in the future to face additional competition from telephone companies providing video services within their service areas 
in providing local and long distance telephone services  we compete with the incumbent local phone company and various long distance providers in each of our markets 
at t  verizon and qwest are the incumbent local phone companies in our markets 
they offer both local and long distance services in our markets and are particularly strong competitors 
we also compete with providers of long distance telephone services  such as at t  mci and sprint

we have entered into contracts with various entities to provide programming to be aired on our network 
we pay a monthly fee for these programming services  generally based on the average number of subscribers to the program  although some fees are adjusted based on the total number of subscribers to the system and or the system penetration percentage 
because programming cost is partially based on the number of subscribers  it will increase as we add more subscribers 
it will also increase as costs per channel increase over time

table of contents 
index to financial statements continued strong growth in business sales  and continued penetration in our mature markets 
we added video connections in as the popularity of additional services and products such as digital video recorders dvrs  high definition televisions and broadcasts continued to grow 
we expect to add new video connections in the future  but as our video segment matures in our current markets  we expect to grow at a decreasing rate compared to our historical experience 
while the number of new video connections may grow at a declining rate  we believe that the opportunity to increase revenue and video gross profits is available through price increases and the introduction of new products and new technology 
new voice and data connections are expected to increase as we continue our sales and marketing efforts directed at selling customers a bundle of services  penetrating untapped market segments and offering new services

the increase in direct costs of video services is primarily due to programming costs increases  which have been increasing over the last several years on an aggregate basis due to an increase in subscribers and on a per subscriber basis due to an increase in costs per program channel 
we expect this trend to continue and may not be able to pass these higher costs on to customers because of competitive factors  which could adversely affect our cash flow and gross profit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses interest rate swap and interest rate cap contracts to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and operating cash flows 
interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate caps involve the receipt of variable rate amounts beyond a specified strike price over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the company believes these agreements are with counter parties who are creditworthy financial institutions

and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement requires that all derivatives be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value  and that changes in fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivatives is initially recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the same periods in which the related interest on the variable rate debt affects earnings 
the ineffective portions are recognized directly in earnings 
upon early termination of a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedge  the resulting gains or losses are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense of the related debt over the remaining period covered by the terminated instrument 
the company has formally documented  designated and assessed at inception of the derivative instruments 
based on criteria listed in sfas no 
pertaining to cash flow derivative instruments that are interest rate swaps  the company has assessed that the swap agreements are completely effective and therefore there are no ineffectiveness 
the company assesses for ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis
