item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we have developed a broad line of pre programmed universal wireless control products and audio video accessories that are marketed to enhance home entertainment systems 
our channels of distribution include international retail  us retail  private label  oems  cable and satellite service providers  cedia custom electronic design and installation association and companies in the computing industry 
we believe that our universal remote control database contains device codes that are capable of controlling virtually all infrared remote ir controlled tvs  vcrs  dvd players  cable converters  cd players  audio components and satellite receivers  as well as most other infrared remote controlled devices worldwide 
beginning in and continuing today  we have compiled an extensive library that covers over  individual device functions and over  individual consumer electronic equipment brand names 
our library is regularly updated with new ir codes used in newly introduced video and audio devices 
all such ir codes are captured from the original manufacturer s remote control devices or manufacturer s specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database 
we have also developed patented technologies that provide the capability to easily upgrade the memory of the wireless control device by adding ir codes from the library that were not originally included 
since the third quarter of  we have been operating as one business segment 
we have eleven operating subsidiaries located in argentina  france  two in germany  hong kong  italy  the netherlands  singapore  spain  india and the united kingdom 
to recap our results for revenue grew from million in to million in full year operating income grew over to million  representing operating margin from million  representing operating margin in  our growth in was the result of strong demand from the customers in our business category  due in part to the continuation of the upgrade cycle from analog to digital  consumer demand for advanced function offerings from subscription broadcasters  and the mid year deadline for ocap compliance  and capped off a successful three year period  where sales during this period grew at a compounded rate of approximately and earnings per share grew at a compounded rate of approximately 
our strategic business objectives for include the following increase our share with existing customers  acquire new customers in historically strong regions  continue our expansion into new regions  asia in particular  continue to develop industry leading technologies and products  and continue to evaluate potential merger and acquisition opportunities that may enhance our business 

table of contents we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  warranties  inventory valuation  business combination purchase price allocations  our review for impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  and they may be adjusted as more information becomes available 
any adjustment could be significant 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of products when delivery has occurred  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
the provision recorded for estimated sales returns and allowances is deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the period the related revenue is recorded 
we accrue for discounts and rebates on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded based on historical experience 
changes in such accruals may be required if future rebates and incentives differ from our estimates 
rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized as cost of sales if we provide products or services for payment 
sales allowances reduce gross accounts receivable to arrive at accounts receivable  net in the same period the related receivable is recorded 
we have no obligations after delivery of our products other than the associated warranties 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for products sold or services rendered 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a variety of factors  including historical experience  length of time receivables are past due  current economic trends and changes in customer payment behavior 
also  we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to a customer change  our estimates of the recoverability of the receivables would be further adjusted  either upward or downward 
we generate service revenue  which is paid monthly  as a result of providing consumer support programs to some of our customers through our call centers 
these service revenues are recognized when services 
table of contents are performed  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also license our intellectual property including our patented technologies  trade secrets  trademarks and database of infrared codes 
we record license revenue when our customers ship products incorporating our intellectual property  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value 
the fair values for the multiple elements are determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  or the price charged when the element is sold separately 
the residual method is utilized when vsoe exists for all the undelivered elements  but not for the delivered element 
this is performed by allocating revenue to the undelivered elements that have vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
when the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined  we defer revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered element is delivered 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we account for revenue under software licensing arrangements involving significant production  modification or customization of software in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
when applying the percentage of completion method  we rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue and labor hours which are provided by our project managers 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and labor applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known  and losses are accrued when identified 
we have not made any material changes in our methodology for recognizing revenue during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
warranty we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship arising during normal use 
we service warranty claims directly through our customer service department or contracted third party warranty repair facilities 
our warranty period ranges up to three years 
we estimate and recognize product warranty costs  which are included in cost of sales  as we sell the related products 
warranty costs are forecasted based on the best available information  primarily historical claims experience and the expected cost per claim 
we have not made any material changes in our warranty reserve methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the warranty reserve 
however  actual claim costs may differ from the amounts estimated 
if a significant product defect were to be discovered on a high volume product  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
historically  product defects have been less than of the net units sold 

table of contents inventories our inventories consist of primarily wireless control devices and the related component parts  including integrated circuits  and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for the estimated difference between the inventory s cost and its estimated market value based upon our best estimates about future demand and market conditions 
we carry inventory in amounts necessary to satisfy our customers inventory requirements on a timely basis 
we continually monitor our inventory status to control inventory levels and write down any excess or obsolete inventories on hand 
our total excess and obsolete inventory reserve as of december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively  or and of total inventory 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our excess and obsolete inventory reserve during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we used to calculate our excess and obsolete inventory reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
each change in the ratio of excess and obsolete inventory reserve to inventory would impact cost of sales by approximately thousand 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  the development of new competing technology that impedes the marketability of our products or the occurrence of significant price decreases in our component parts  such as integrated circuits 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development iprd  based upon their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant fair value estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management estimates the fair value of certain intangible assets by utilizing the following but not limited to future free cash flow from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies  and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and cash flows from the products once they are completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions regarding the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio and discount rates utilized in discounted cash flow models 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  however  unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we assess long lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review if significant include the following underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  changes in the strategy of our overall business  negative industry or economic trends  
table of contents a decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a variance between our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset or an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment we perform an impairment review 
if the carrying value of the asset is larger than the undiscounted cash flows  the asset is impaired 
we measure an impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in assessing the recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to material impairment charges 
goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available  and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
our domestic and international operations are components and reporting units of our sole operating segment 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the present value of the reporting unit s expected future cash flows is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the present value of the reporting unit s expected future cash flows over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to material impairment charges 

table of contents income taxes we are periodically under audit by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
these audits include questions regarding tax filing positions we have taken  including the timing and amount of deductions of income among various tax jurisdictions 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing of expense recognition for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we must provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for tax liabilities involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
prior to january   in situations involving tax related uncertainties  we provided for tax liabilities when we believed such liabilities were probable under sfas  accounting for contingent liabilities 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective january  in accordance with the adoption of fin  we evaluate our tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard  a full reserve is established against the tax asset or a liability is recorded 
additionally  for a position that is determined to  more likely than not  be sustainable  we measure the benefit at the greatest cumulative probability of being realized and establish a reserve or liability for the balance 
management believes that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
a material change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate and our results 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
stock based compensation expense is presented in the same income statement line as cash compensation paid to the same employees or directors 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in pre tax stock based compensation expense 
included in sg a stock based compensation expense is thousand and thousand in pre tax compensation expense related to stock awards granted to outside directors for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the income tax benefit associated with stock based compensation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prior to january   we accounted for options granted under these plans using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas under the intrinsic value method of apb  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we grant options with an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant  therefore no compensation expense was recognized related to those options for the fiscal year 

table of contents stock based compensation expense was included in the following for the years ended december  and in thousands cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative total stock based compensation expense during the year ended december   we granted  and  stock options to executive and non executive employees  respectively 
as of december   we expect to recognize million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested employee stock options over a weighted average life of years 
we issue restricted stock awards to the outside directors for services performed 
under sfas no 
r  compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the shares awarded as of the grant date 
compensation expense for the restricted stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of one year 
the fair value of non vested shares is determined based on the average of the high and low trade prices of our company s shares on the grant date 
during the years ended december   and  we granted   and  shares  respectively 
as of december   we expect to recognize million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock awards over a weighted average life of six months 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the utilization of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management determined that historical volatility calculated based on our actively traded common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to material stock based compensation expense 
for instance  if our actual forfeiture rate decreased by  stock based compensation expense would have increased by approximately million  or for the year ended december  
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the same period last year 
net income for was million or per share basic and per share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for millions of total millions of total net sales business consumer total net sales net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were approximately of net sales for compared to approximately for net sales in our business lines for increased by to million from million in this increase in sales resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of remote control sales  which was partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in remote control sales volume was attributable to the continued deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators and market share gains with a few key subscription broadcasting customers 
these advanced functions include digital video recording dvr  video on demand vod  and high definition television hdtv 
we expect that the deployment of the advanced function set top boxes by the service operators will continue into the foreseeable future as penetration for each of the functions cited continues to increase 
as a result  we expect business category revenue to range between and million in net sales in our consumer lines one for all retail  private label  custom installers  and direct import were approximately of net sales for compared to approximately for net sales in our consumer lines for increased by to million  from million in the increase in sales resulted primarily from our expanding presence in the custom electronic design installation association cedia market 
cedia sales increased by million  or  from additionally  retail sales made outside of the united states increased by million 
these sales were positively impacted by the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately million 
net of this positive currency effect  retail sales outside of the united states were down by million  primarily due to lower sales in the uk and australia 
partially offsetting these increases were united states direct import licensing and product 
table of contents revenues for  which decreased by million  or  to million in  down from million in this was due to a decline in royalty revenue and a decline in the volume of kameleon sales 
additionally  private label sales decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this was due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales in the united states 
we expect consumer category revenue to range between and million in gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was  which is comparable to the gross profit rate was positively impacted by the strengthening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase of approximately million in gross profit  or an increase of in the gross profit rate 
a decrease in royalty expense of million  due to lower sales of sky branded retail product in europe  increased the gross profit rate by 
offsetting the increases in the gross profit rate was an increase in freight and handling expense of million in as compared to  which reduced the gross profit rate by 
the increase in freight expense is due primarily to an increase in the percentage of units that were shipped by air  air freight is significantly more costly than ocean freight 
additionally  subscription broadcast sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate as compared to our other sales  represented a larger percentage of our total business 
the impact of this change in mix was a reduction in the gross profit rate 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily related to internal as well as third party costs associated with the continued expansion of the nevo platform and the development of products for sale in our subscription broadcasting  retail  and oem channels 
we expect that research and development expenses will range between million and million for the full year selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in payroll and benefits increased by million due to new hires and merit increases  the strengthening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar resulted in an increase of million  long term incentive compensation increased by million  delivery  freight  and handling costs increased by million  additional travel resulted in an increase of million  director s fees and expenses increased by million  and commission expense increased by million 
these items were partially offset by lower employee bonus expense  which decreased by million 
we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will range between and million for the full year in  we recorded million of net interest income compared to million net for this increase is due to higher money market rates and a higher average cash balance 
net interest income will range between and million in in  we had thousand in other income  net as compared to million of other expense  net for approximately million of other expense in resulted from foreign currency losses 
we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in our effective tax rate is due primarily to additional income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions 
we estimate that our effective tax rate will range between and for the full year 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to million for the same period last year 
net income for was million or per share basic and per share diluted compared to million or per share basic and per share diluted for millions of total millions of total net sales business consumer total net sales net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were approximately of net sales for compared to approximately for net sales in our business lines for increased by to million from million in this increase in sales resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of remote control sales  which was partially offset by lower prices 
the increase in remote control sales volume was attributable to the continued deployment of advanced function set top boxes by the service operators and market share gains with a few key subscription broadcasting customers 
these advanced functions include digital video recording dvr  video on demand vod  and high definition television hdtv 
net sales in our consumer lines one for all retail  private label  custom installers  and direct import were approximately of net sales for compared to approximately for net sales in our consumer lines for increased by to million  from million in retail sales outside north america and europe increased by million compared to due to a new distributor in australia and strong sales in argentina  brazil and new zealand 
the increase in consumer lines net sales was also driven by the strengthening of both the euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately million 
however  excluding the positive foreign exchange impact  the dollar amount of european retail sales was constant  compared to the prior year 
this increase in consumer lines net sales was also driven by our entry into the custom electronic design installation association cedia market in the second quarter of  as cedia sales increased by million from partially offsetting these increases was private label sales  which decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this was due to a decline in the volume of kameleon sales in the united states 
additionally  united states direct import licensing and product revenues for decreased by million or  to million in from million in  due to a decline in royalty revenue 
gross profit for was million compared to million for gross profit as a percent of sales for was compared to for the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to subscription broadcast sales  which generally have a lower gross profit rate as compared to our other sales  representing a larger percentage of our total business 
the impact of this change in mix was a reduction in the gross profit rate 
partially offsetting this decrease in the gross profit rate was a reduction of million of freight expense recorded in as compared to in  there was a decrease in the percentage of units that were shipped by air 
lower freight expense contributed to a increase in the gross profit rate 
a reduction in inventory scrap expense of million added to the gross profit rate 
scrap expense has declined as inventory management has improved 
royalty expense increased thousand  but added to the gross profit rate 
royalty expense is tied to consumer sales  which have declined as a percentage of our total business 
warranty expense decreased by million  which added to the profit rate 
gross profit was also favorably impacted by the strengthening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in gross profit of approximately million and an increase of in the gross profit rate 

table of contents research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the expensing of stock options  which was adopted on january  sfas r  accounted for million of the increase 
the remainder of the increase is related to development efforts with radio frequency technology using the z wave platform  continued expansion of the nevo platform and development efforts taking place at our san mateo location 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in employee performance based bonuses increased by million  payroll and benefits increased by million due to the growth of our company  expensing of stock options  which was adopted on january  sfas r  amounted to million  travel increased million  delivery and freight costs increased by million due to the increase in sales volume  advertising increased by million  million is attributable to tradeshows and million due to the strengthening of both the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar 
these items were partially offset by lower bad debt expense  which decreased by million 
fiscal bad debt expense included a million write down for a receivable due from a former european distributor 
in  we recorded million of interest income compared to million for this increase is due to higher money market rates and a higher average cash balance 
in  other expense  net was million as compared to million of other income  net for approximately million of other expense in resulted from foreign currency losses  and approximately million of other income in resulted from foreign currency gains 
we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate is due primarily to the netherlands statutory tax rate decreasing from in to in liquidity and capital resources year ended year ended year ended december  increase december  increase december  in thousands decrease decrease cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash provided by used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes increase december  decrease december  cash and cash equivalents working capital cash provided by operating activities our principal sources of funds are from operations 
cash provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily due to the increase in net income of from million in to million in  offset partially by an increase in days sales outstanding and a decrease in inventory turns 
our days sales outstanding increased due to certain customers delaying payment beyond their respective payment terms 
we do not believe that these customers represent a credit risk or bad debt risk 
the decrease in inventory turns is due directly to weaker than expected fourth quarter sales 

table of contents the increase in cash flows from operations in compared to is primarily due to an increase in net sales  which resulted in an increase in net income of from million in to million in  as well as improvement in our days sales outstanding and overall inventory management 
our days sales outstanding improved from approximately days at december  to approximately days at december   due primarily to strong collections from our significant customers 
in addition  despite an increase in net sales of approximately from to  inventory levels remained relatively constant with the prior year 
cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities during was million as compared to million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for investing activities in compared to was due to increased capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in   and were million  million and million  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we began to renovate and expand our corporate headquarters 
construction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of the total cost of this renovation is estimated to be approximately million  which will be financed through our current operations 
in addition we will receive million tenant improvement allowance upon completion of construction 
we also plan to make a significant investment to upgrade our information systems  which we expect to cost approximately million 
the strategic planning for the upgrade of our information systems commenced in the second quarter of and we expect implementation to be completed in in addition  in order to support our sales growth  annual purchases of tooling equipment have increased throughout the years 
cash provided by used for financing activities cash provided by financing activities during was million compared to cash provided by financing activities during of million and cash used for financing activities of million during proceeds from stock option exercises were million during  compared to proceeds of million and million during and  respectively 
in  gain on stock option exercises resulted in a million excess tax benefit compared to thousand and for and  respectively 
we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million during  compared to  and  shares at a cost of million and million during and  respectively 
we hold these shares as treasury stock  and they are available for reissue 
presently  except for using a minimal number of these treasury shares to compensate our outside board members  we have no plans to distribute these shares  although we may change these plans if necessary to fulfill our on going business objectives 
effective august   we amended our original credit facility with comerica  extending our line of credit through august  under the amended credit facility  we have authority to acquire up to an additional million shares of our common stock in the open market 
from august   through december   we purchased  shares of our common stock  leaving  shares available for purchase under the credit facility 
during we may continue to purchase shares of our common stock if we believe conditions are favorable and to offset the dilutive effect of stock option exercises 
the amended credit facility provides a million unsecured revolving credit agreement with comerica for an additional three years  expiring on august  under the credit facility  the interest payable is variable and is based on the bank s cost of funds or the libor rate plus a fixed margin of 
the interest rate in effect as of december  using the libor rate option plus a fixed margin of was 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from zero to a maximum rate of of per year on the unused portion of the credit line depending on the amount of cash investment retained with comerica during each quarter 
under the terms of the credit facility  dividend payments are allowed for up to of the prior fiscal year s net income  to be paid within days of this period s year end 
we are subject to certain financial covenants related to our net worth  quick ratio  and net income 
amounts available for borrowing under the credit facility are reduced by the outstanding balance of import letters of credit 
as of december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under the credit facility or any 
table of contents outstanding import letters of credit 
furthermore  as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants required by the credit facility 
as of december   we had available million on the line of credit 
historically  our working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
at december   we had million of working capital as compared to at december  the increase in working capital during these periods is principally due to higher cash  accounts receivable and inventory balances at december  compared to december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations primarily consist of an agreement with a specific vendor to purchase approximately of our integrated circuits through october  from this vendor 
at december   we did not have any bank guarantees that provide for the bank to make payment on our behalf in the event of our non payment for transactions with suppliers in the ordinary course of business 
at december   we had approximately million and million of cash and cash equivalents in the united states and europe  respectively

other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  such as debt issuance costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we currently are determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of our eligible items and cannot estimate the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of statement r will have an effect on our financial statements  however  the effect is dependent upon whether we make any future acquisitions and the specifics of those acquisitions

eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes disclosure requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for  and the financial statement presentation of  noncontrolling equity interests in a consolidated subsidiary 
sfas replaces the existing minority interest provisions of accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements  by defining a new term noncontrolling interests to replace what were previously called minority interests 
the new standard establishes noncontrolling interests as a component of the equity of a consolidated entity 
the underlying principle of the new standard is that both the controlling interest and the noncontrolling interests are part of the equity of a single economic entity 
table of contents the consolidated reporting entity 
classifying noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated equity is a change from the current practice of treating minority interests as a mezzanine item between liabilities and equity or as a liability 
the change affects both the accounting and financial reporting for noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary 
sfas includes reporting requirements intended to clearly identify and differentiate the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
the reporting requirements are required to be applied retrospectively 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
we currently do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a significant effect on our financial statements as we wholly own our subsidiaries 

table of contents outlook our focus is to build technology and products that make the consumer s interaction with devices and content within the home easier and more enjoyable 
the pace of change in the home is increasing 
the growth of new devices  such as dvd players  pvr dvr technologies  hdtv and home theater solutions  to name only a few  has transformed control of the home entertainment center into a complex challenge for the consumer 
the more recent introduction and projected growth of digital media technologies in the consumer s life will further increase this complexity 
we have set out to create the interface for the connected home  building a bridge between the home devices of today and the networked home of the future 
we intend to invest in new products and technology  particularly in the connected home space  which will expand our business beyond the control of devices to the control of and access to content  such as digital media  to enrich the entertainment experience 
we will continue enhancing our leadership position in our core business by developing custom products for our subscription broadcasting  oem  retail and computing customers  growing our capture expertise in infrared technology and radio frequency standards  adding to our portfolio of patented or patent pending technologies and developing new platform products 
we are also developing new ways to enhance remote controls and other accessory products 
we are continuing to seek ways to use our technology to make the set up and use of control products  and the access to and control of digital entertainment within the home entertainment network  easier and more affordable 
in addition  we are working on product line extensions to our one for all branded products which include digital antennas  signal boosters  and other a v accessories

moreover  if consummated  no assurance can be made that any such acquisition or partnership will profitably add to our operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of these risks and the use of financial instruments to mitigate our risk exposure 
on august   we amended our credit facility to extend for an additional three years  expiring on august  the interest payable under our revolving credit facility with our bank is variable and based on either i the bank s cost of funds or ii the libor rate plus a fixed margin of  the rate is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   we had no borrowings on our credit facility 
the interest rate in effect on the credit facility as of december  using the libor rate option plus a fixed margin of was 
at december  we had wholly owned subsidiaries in the netherlands  united kingdom  germany  france  argentina  spain  italy  singapore  hong kong and india 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in local currencies including euros  british pounds and argentine pesos  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in local currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar and  in some cases  to each other  may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and net income 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates that affect cash flows and our reported income 
contract terms for the foreign currency exchange agreements normally last less than nine months 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the value of our net balance sheet positions held in foreign currency can also be impacted by fluctuating exchange rates  as can the value of the income generated by our european subsidiaries 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of fluctuations on reported income  as it depends on the opening and closing rates  the average net balance sheet positions held in a foreign currency and the amount of income generated in local currency 
we routinely forecast what these balance sheet positions and income generated in local currency may be  and we take steps to minimize exposure as we deem appropriate 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to the variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currency 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we believe that movements in foreign currency rates could have a material affect on our financial position 
we estimate that if the exchange rates for the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar fluctuate from december   net income and cash flows in the first quarter of would fluctuate by approximately million and million  respectively
