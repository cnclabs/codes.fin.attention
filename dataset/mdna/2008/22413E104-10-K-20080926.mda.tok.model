table of contents seasonality historically sales of the company s products  particularly ceiling fans and lighting kits  have been somewhat seasonal with sales in the warmer first and fourth quarters being higher than in the two other fiscal quarters

risk factors 
described below are certain risks that we believe are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate

there are also risks within the economy and the capital markets  both domestically and internationally  that affect business generally  including us and other companies in our industry  such as the effects of terrorist attacks or other acts of war  including conflicts or war involving the united states or its allies or trading partners  the general strength of the economy  levels of consumer spending and consumer confidence  inflation  higher interest rates  higher fuel and other energy costs  higher transportation  fuel and utility costs  higher costs of labor  insurance and healthcare  labor strikes  weather conditions or natural disasters  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and higher levels of unemployment  which have not been described 
you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
if any of the events described below occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected 
the following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward looking statements made by us related to conditions or events that we anticipate may occur in the future 
all of the forward looking statements made by us are qualified by the risks described below 
the following should not be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 

table of contents strategic risks and strategy execution risks the industries we operate in are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
we compete with numerous companies  including several major manufacturers and distributors 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have  which could allow them to compete more successfully than us 
most of our products are available from several other sources  and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors 
manufacturers could also increase their efforts to sell directly to our customers and end users and bypass distributors like us 
in the future  we may be unable to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues 
if we fail to gain customer acceptance of our existing and new products  our operating results could suffer 
we sell our products primarily to lighting showrooms and mass merchandisers 
if we fail to successfully introduce new products that are accepted by our customers  our operating results may be adversely affected 
our failure in pursuing or executing any of our new business ventures  strategic alliances and acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our growth strategy includes expansion through new business ventures  strategic alliances and acquisitions 
while we employ several different valuation methodologies to assess a potential growth opportunity  and structure favorable payout strategies to lower risk  we can give no assurance that any of our new business ventures and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance 
any acquisitions that we make may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies  and may result in the diversion of our capital and management s attention from our other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies that we acquire  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general operating procedures 
if we fail to successfully integrate companies that we acquire  our business could suffer materially 
we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over our financial reporting in connection with our integration of an acquired company 
in addition  our efforts to integrate any acquired company  and its financial results  into our company may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our revenues depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as key customers  vendors  and manufacturers of the products that we distribute to our customers 
our future operating results depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as key customers  vendors and manufacturers 
if we fail to maintain our existing relationships with these parties or fail to acquire relationships with others like them in the future  our business may suffer 
our future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management and retention of key personnel 
our success depends upon our ability to attract  motivate  and retain key management and personnel 
we depend upon the continued services of our key executive officers  including our chief executive officer 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel could have a negative impact on our business 

table of contents risks associated with international trade as we do not manufacture most of the products that we distribute  we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of high quality competitive products on a timely basis 
we obtain over of our products from third party suppliers in china and mexico with the remainder supplied from vendors  or self manufactured  in the united states 
we do not have long term contracts with the vast majority of our suppliers committing them to supply products to us 
most of our products are imported from suppliers under short term purchase orders that we place with them 
therefore  our suppliers may not provide us with the products we need in the quantities that we request 
because we do not control the actual production of the products that we sell  we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control 
political or financial instability  merchandise quality issues  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transportation capacity and costs  inflation  outbreak of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 
in the event that any of our third party suppliers become unable or unwilling to continue to provide us with products in the volumes that we require  we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis  if at all  or at costs acceptable to us 
an extended interruption in the supply of our products would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
risks related to profitable growth a decline in general economic condition  particularly the housing  home construction  and remodel sectors  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
general economic conditions in the united states  including the housing and home construction sectors  are affected by  among other things  consumer spending habits  levels of employment  salary and wage rates  prevailing interest rates  income tax rates and policies  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a decline in general economic conditions in the united states could lead to a reduced demand for our products 
the united states has experienced a significant downturn in both new home construction and existing home sales in the past months and this downturn has negatively affected the company s business 
the loss of certain of our customers that represent a significant percentage of our net sales could adversely affect our results of operations 
all of the mass segment s net sales  including the net sales of woodard  tsi  phi and design trends  are made to mass merchandisers  with lowe s comprising the most significant portion of mass net sales 
the loss of or reduction in our orders with this customer  or any other significant customer  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results  as could disputes with our customers regarding shipments  fees  product condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if net sales to these customers are at levels significantly lower than currently anticipated  we would be required to find other customers for existing inventory on hand 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain additional customers for this inventory or that any alternative sources would generate similar sales levels and profit margins as anticipated with these current mass merchandiser customers 
we do not have long term sales agreements with or other contractual assurances as to future sales from any of our customers 
our customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price  product quality  consumer demand  customer service performance and their desired inventory levels 
changes in our customers strategies  including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products unless we provide such products may adversely affect our net sales 
additionally  our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our net sales of products to one or more of our customers are reduced  this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our mass merchandise customers may pressure us to lower our prices or take other actions that may adversely impact our results of operations 
mass merchandisers may pressure us to lower our prices in addition to requiring various stipulations from us related to inventory practices  product reset costs  logistics or other aspects of the customer supplier relationship 
for example  wal mart and other customers have indicated a desire to utilize radio frequency identification rfid technology in an effort to improve tracking and management of product in their supply chain 
large scale implementation of this technology would significantly increase our product manufacturing and distribution costs 
meeting these types of demands of customers may adversely affect our margins and results of operations 
if we fail to effectively respond to these types of demands of our customers  our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our mass merchandise customers hold line reviews throughout the year for each product category 
line reviews give us the potential to add new skus  however  participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of our existing skus in the product lines currently offered 
our mass merchandise customers may choose to directly source many of the products we currently provide 
we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors 
as a result  there are ongoing competitive product and pricing pressures in the environments in which we operate  as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins 
to address these challenges  we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors  including pricing  promotional incentives and trade terms 
in particular  our mass merchandise customers may choose to source directly from manufacturers in asia many of the products we currently provide 
to the extent our mass merchandiser customers purchase products in excess of consumer consumption in any period  our net sales in a subsequent period may be adversely affected as mass merchandisers seek to reduce their inventory levels 
from time to time  mass merchandisers may purchase more products from us than they expect to sell to consumers during a particular time period 
if mass merchandisers increase their inventory during a particular reporting period  then our sales during the subsequent reporting period may be adversely impacted as these mass merchandisers seek to reduce their inventory to usual levels 
to the extent our customers seek to reduce their usual or customary inventory levels  the adverse impact of such de inventorying on our sales and profitability would be even greater 
increases in our shipping costs or service trouble with our third party shippers could harm our business 
shipping is a significant expense in our business for the products we import from manufacturers and the products we ship to customers 
any significant increase we experience in our shipping rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
similarly  strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
we experience fluctuations in our quarterly earnings 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline or be highly volatile 
our product sales  particularly ceiling fans and patio furniture  are subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations 
our net sales and operating profits historically have been higher in the first and fourth quarters from the warmer weather during these months 
we expect that our newly acquired patio furniture lines will experience increased sales during the third quarter 
our quarterly results may also be adversely affected by a variety of other factors  including the timing of our new product releases  costs related to our acquisitions and or integrations of businesses that we may acquire  timing and amount of our sales and marketing expenditures  timing of our orders from mass merchandisers  our commitments to mass merchandisers  including charge backs for returns and defective merchandise  
table of contents loss of any of our sales representatives  general economic conditions that may affect us  including those in the housing sector  establishing or maintaining our business relationships  and changes in our accounting principles 
these and other factors could affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations  and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult 
in addition  the nasdaq global market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
in the past  periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities have often been followed by securities class action litigation instituted against companies 
this type of litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  which would harm us 
our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations  each of which could adversely impact the value of our common stock 
there has been limited trading in our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will be maintained 
our common stock has experienced  and is likely to experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
these fluctuations may also cause short sellers to enter the market from time to time in the belief that we will have poor results in the future 
we cannot predict the actions of market participants and  therefore  can offer no assurances that the market for our stock will be stable or appreciate over time 
risks relating to liquidity our inability to meet financial covenants contained in our credit facilities could adversely impact our ability to fund our operations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our planned capital expenditures  acquisitions  and dividends will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to satisfy those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot provide assurance that we will satisfy those ratios 
a breach by us of any of these financial ratio covenants or other covenants could result in our being in default under our credit facility 
upon the occurrence of an event of default by us  our lenders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to us to extend further credit 
we cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the outstanding indebtedness in full under our credit facility if it were accelerated by our lenders 

table of contents we are exposed to the risk of an increase in interest rates 
we do not have any agreements with third parties to hedge against the potential rising of interest rates 
the variable rates of interest on our credit facility are composed of libor plus the spread as defined by the loan agreements 
as a result of our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to the risk of foreign currency appreciation 
generally  we purchase our products in us dollars 
however  we source our products from overseas manufacturers in the people s republic of china 
as a result  our costs of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
these foreign currencies include the chinese yuan 
we cannot be assured that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
risks associated with dependence on technology we rely heavily on our management information systems for manufacturing  inventory management  distribution and other functions 
if our systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if we experience an interruption in our operations  we could be materially adversely affected 
the efficient operation of our company is dependent on our management information systems 
we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage our order entry  order fulfillment  pricing  point of sale  and inventory replenishment processes 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenue  increased overhead costs  and excess or out of stock inventory levels  causing us to suffer materially 
regulatory risks tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our net earnings and tax liabilities 
we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states  state and local governments  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
from time to time  various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions 
there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 
in addition  tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws  regulations and existing precedent  we cannot give assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities  or that we would be successful in any such challenge 
we are subject to increasingly complex corporate governance  public disclosure  accounting  and tax requirements that have increased our costs and the risk of our not being in compliance with these requirements 
we are subject to rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  the sec  the internal revenue service  and the nasdaq stock market  have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of our management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we also are subject to periodic audits or other reviews by these governmental agencies and external auditors 
these examinations or reviews frequently require management s time and diversion of internal resources and  in the event of an unfavorable outcome to us  may result in additional liabilities or adjustments to our historical financial results 

table of contents recent changes in accounting rules  including the expensing of stock options granted to our employees  could have a material impact on our reported business and financial results 
the us generally accepted accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the pcaob  the sec  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results 
risks associated with labor employees could seek coverage under collective bargaining agreements  and drive significant increases in salaries and benefits 
currently none of the employees of craftmade or any of its subsidiaries is represented by a trade union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes that it maintains an excellent relationship with its employees and is highly competitive in terms of the compensation and benefits it offers  and has never suffered from any type of work stoppage or strike 
however  if any group of our employees was to seek representation by a union or coverage under a collective bargaining agreement  subsequent negotiations could lead to either increased salary and benefits costs  work stoppage  slow down or general strike which could disrupt the company s business and make it difficult to sell products and support our customers 
such changes in labor relations and associated costs could also lead to changes in the size or location of our facilities  and potential loss of experienced personnel 
we are subject to inflation in labor costs if economic conditions impact prevailing wages in the geographic regions in which we operate 
the company directly employs workers in its coppell  texas facility as well as the woodard office in chicago  illinois  and manufacturing facility in owosso  michigan 
labor costs in each of these areas are affected by multiple local and national factors such as inflation  unemployment rates  cost of living and interest rates 
while the company believes it is highly competitive in terms of the compensation and benefits it offers in each of these areas  changes in these economic factors  and the need to remain competitive and attract a strong work force  could drive increases in the cost of salary and benefits over time 
risks associated with insurance product liability failure or flaws in our products could lead to product liability claims and payment of associated financial damages or penalties 
the company goes to great length to ensure that its products meet the highest standard for reliability and consumer safety 
we work closely with our both our company owned and contract manufacturers to design  develop and produce products that are both attractive and highly functional  and that pose no threat to our customers when used in an appropriate manner 
in the current highly litigious environment any flaw or failure in our products that causes harm to an individual  property damage or simply consumer dissatisfaction could become the source of legal action  either on an individual or class action basis 
such legal actions could have wide ranging impact including distraction of senior management  adverse publicity  legal fees and financial damages or penalties 
while no material claims have been made against the company since its inception and the company maintains product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that claims will not arise in the future or that the coverage of the policy will be sufficient to pay any claims 
risks associated with balancing inventory the company could suffer financial losses due to carrying excessive inventory  or conversely due to having insufficient inventory on hand to meet the needs of our customers 
since over of our sales are sourced from china  the company has to maintain high levels of inventory in 
table of contents order to meet customer needs and our own delivery policies 
the purchase  shipping and warehousing of our products carries significant cost and therefore the company also seeks to minimize inventory levels wherever possible 
in order to gain and retain distribution of our products we often need to produce specific product lines under customer owned private label brands  which legally cannot be sold in any outlets other than that customer s 
discontinued or overstocked product from the private label segment generally has to be destroyed or liquidated at highly discounted and unprofitable prices 
management believes that competing in the private label segment is essential to gaining market share and sales in the mass segment  and therefore is willing to increase its inventory risk by producing and selling private label products 
our design  sales  marketing and manufacturing teams have years of experience in each of the segments we operate in and work to maintain a strong knowledge of current consumer and retail trends  customer buying habits  and the general economic environment to ensure that we are ordering and stocking products that will sell through at a reliable and consistent rate 
we also leverage our internal systems  policies and controls to maintain the proper level of inventory  balancing economic cost with customer needs 
we cannot ensure that this balance is always maintained  and any misjudgment in inventory management can have an adverse impact on the company s financial statements and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this form k  including the factors disclosed under item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for the company s conclusions 
the company continually evaluates the information used to make these estimates as its business and the economic environment changes 
the company s management believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements  so the company considers these to be its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized as product is shipped and related services are performed in accordance with all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
for these transactions the company applies the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title generally transfers upon shipment of goods from the company s warehouse 
the company does not have an obligation or policy of replacing customer products damaged or lost in transit 
in some instances  the company ships product directly from its suppliers to the customers 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue when the product is accepted by the customer s representative 
for certain products  the company offers preseason early order programs that carry extended terms whereby customers may order and take delivery of products prior to the selling season 
products sold under preseason programs have no right of return 
the company applies the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company s application of eitf includes evaluation of its terms with each major customer relative to a number of criteria that management considers in making its determination with respect to gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with its customers 
management s criteria for making these judgments place particular emphasis on determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk 
the company records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue  and related costs as cost of sales  when incurred  in accordance with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
as part of its revenue recognition policy  the company records an accrual of estimated incentives payable to its customers as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded 
the company bases its estimates on contractual terms of the programs and estimated or actual sales to individual customers 
actual incentives payable in any future period are inherently uncertain and  thus  may differ from its estimates 
if actual or expected incentives were significantly greater than the reserves the company had established  the company would record a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the company made such determination 
in addition to various incentive programs  from time to time  the company is required to provide mark down funds to certain of its mass retail customers to assist them in clearing slow moving inventory 
these mark down funds are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenues are recorded 

table of contents the company is also required to provide for the cost of labor associated with resetting store displays 
resets involve removing slow moving inventory and replacing it with new products 
although reset costs are paid to third parties who perform the services  they are considered an incentive to our mass merchandise customers 
for existing products that are replaced  the company accrues an estimate for the cost as in increase to cost of goods sold in advance of the reset at the time that the related revenues are recorded 
the company bases its estimates on a number of factors  including information obtained from our customers about their future plans 
the cost for any new products or space that is gained is expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of goods sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly analyzes significant customer balances  and  when it becomes evident a specific customer will be unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  a specific allowance for doubtful account is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is believed reasonably collectible 
the company also records allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experiences 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventories the company s inventories are primarily composed of finished goods and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method 
for inventory shipped out of the woodard facility in owosso  michigan  inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined principally by the use of the standard cost method which approximates first in  first out fifo  or market 
the company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill the company assesses the carrying values of goodwill annually or when circumstances dictate that the carrying value might be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is analyzed at the reporting unit level 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using discounted cash flow analysis 
in the event that an impairment is determined to have occurred  the company will reduce the carrying value of the asset in that period 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates are considered 
deferred income taxes have been provided on unremitted earnings from foreign investees 
the company reviews its deferred tax assets for ultimate realization and will record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
tax authorities may not always agree with the tax positions taken by the company 
the company believes it has adequate reserves in the event that a taxing authority differs with positions taken  however  there can be no assurance that the company s results will not be affected adversely 
see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
variable interest entities variable interest entities vies are primarily entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents the company has a ownership interest in design trends  a limited liability company 
in connection with the adoption of fin r  the company concluded that design trends is a vie and that the company is the primary beneficiary

accordingly  the results of operations of phi have historically been included in the consolidated income before minority interest of the company 
prior to the acquisition  the minority interest in phi income was excluded from the company s consolidated net income 
since the effective date of the acquisition on july   no minority interest exists in phi  and accordingly  the consolidated net income includes the full amount of phi results from this date 
overview management reviews a number of key indicators to evaluate the company s financial performance  including net sales  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses by segment 
a condensed overview of results for the fiscal year ended june   and the corresponding prior year period is summarized in the table that follows in thousands  except percentage data

net sales for the company increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily from the acquisition of the assets of woodard  llc  partially offset by declines in sales of ceiling fans  lighting and accessories sales 
net sales from the specialty segment increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily from the acquisition of the assets of woodard  llc  as summarized in the following table 

table of contents net sales of specialty segment dollars in thousands fans woodard lighting outdoor segment fiscal year ended accessories furniture total june  june  dollar increase decrease percent increase decrease the sales of ceiling fans and lighting related products continue to be affected by the extremely weak overall housing market 
management continues to focus on introducing new lighting products  expanding teiber accounts and developing new accounts for the durocraft product lines to offset the weak housing market 
management believes that long term growth will be favorably affected by additional product offerings through enhanced product development efforts  as well as selling outdoor furniture products to lighting showrooms and selling outdoor lighting and ceiling fans to patio dealers  and focusing efforts on the hospitality markets 
net sales of the mass segment increased  or to  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily from the acquisition of the net assets of woodard  llc  as summarized in the following table net sales of mass segment dollars in thousands woodard lighting outdoor segment fiscal year ended accessories furniture total june  june  dollar increase decrease percent increase decrease sales of lighting products and ceiling fan accessories to the mass segment are primarily from craftmade s trade source and design trends subsidiaries  both of which experienced declines in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in net sales of trade source was primarily the result of i a decline in orders from lowe s related to indoor lighting and outdoor lighting  ii lower sales of non core drop shipped products  and iii lower sales of fan accessories 
in november  lowe s notified trade source that it will no longer source the indoor and outdoor lighting skus previously sold by trade source to lowe s via direct import 
the final shipments were shipped in during the third quarter of fiscal year additional information is detailed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  the decline in design trends net sales was primarily due to reduced retail sales of the mix and match portable lamp program through lowe s 
currently  design trends supplies mix and match portable lamps to all lowe s regional distribution centers 
woodard sales were primarily composed of direct import sales to its various mass merchant customers 
most of its products are shipped directly from china 
due to the seasonal nature of outdoor furniture sales  most sales to mass merchants occur from january to april each year 

table of contents based on the most recent annual line review  management believes that lowe s remains committed to the respective programs it currently has with the company 
management believes that  based on the amount of product currently shipped to lowe s  design trends and phi continue to be primary vendors for lowe s mix and match portable lamp and fan accessory ceiling medallion programs  respectively 
management believes that the company will continue to be invited to participate in each of lowe s scheduled line reviews for its existing and new product lines 
the line reviews occur on an annual basis for each product category throughout the year and give us the potential to add new skus to the lowe s program 
however  participation in line reviews could also result in a partial or complete reduction of either subsidiary s existing skus in the product lines currently offered to lowe s 
management believes that the future growth of the mass segment is contingent upon the success of the company s ongoing efforts to introduce new products  styles and marketing concepts to existing customers and the expansion of the business to new customers 
gross profit 
gross profit of the company as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended june   compared to for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to increased sales of woodard products that carry a lower gross profit as compared to net sales

woodard gross profit as a percent of net sales is low as all sales are direct import 
for fiscal year  gross profit as a percentage of net sales of lighting products and ceiling fan accessories is expected to remain consistent with the fiscal year ended june   provided that the segment maintains a sales mix  customer concentration and level of vendor program commitment similar to that maintained during fiscal year

health insurance expense was higher in the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the prior year due to increased claims 
management anticipates that based on current market conditions  sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year will be relatively consistent with results generated in fiscal year while management expects to capture some sg a synergies in relation to the integration of the woodard  llc assets  due to continued pressure on sales these savings may not result in lower sg a as a percentage of net sales
