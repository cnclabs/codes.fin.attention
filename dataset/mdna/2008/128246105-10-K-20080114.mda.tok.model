item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  prepared avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states and elsewhere in the world 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing competitive returns to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offerings to include avocados sourced on an international basis  prepared avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report our operations in two different business segments fresh products and processed products 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we report our financial results on a november to october fiscal year basis to coincide with the california avocado harvest season 
on october   we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of calavo growers of california  an agricultural marketing cooperative association  exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock 
concurrently with this transaction  the cooperative was merged into us with calavo emerging as the surviving entity 
these transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non profit cooperative to a for profit corporation 
the merger and the conversion were approved on an overwhelming basis by both the cooperative s shareholders and our board of directors 
prior to the merger  the cooperative reported results of operations as constituting either member the packing and distribution of avocados procured from either members or associate members or non member business non member business included both the processed product business and the sourcing and distribution of all crops that were not procured from the cooperative s members 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados grown in california for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate three packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts to retain and recruit growers that meet our business model 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in mexico and chile  as well as other various commodities  including tomatoes  papayas  mushrooms  onions  coconuts  and pineapples 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to procure and sell non californian grown avocados to complement our distribution efforts of california grown avocados 
we believe that the introduction of these avocados  although competitive at times with california grown avocados  provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our processed products business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
customers include both food service industry and retail businesses and our products primarily include both frozen and cold pasteurized fresh guacamole 
cold pasteurized fresh guacamole refers to fresh guacamole product that has been treated by one of our ultra high pressure machines 
we currently have two liter ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan  michoac n  mexico uruapan 
these machines utilize ultra high pressure only ie without additives or preservatives and destroy the cells of any bacteria that could lead to spoilage or oxidation issues 
due to the long shelf life of our frozen processed products and the purity of our ultra high pressure guacamole  we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today s customers 
we believe our ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers 
we also believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  high end salsas  
table of contents mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we continue to seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
net sales of frozen products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and our fresh products business is highly seasonal and is characterized by crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our processed products business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and processed products we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales 
the derived percentage is then applied to the current period s sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period 
the offsetting credit is made to allowance for accounts receivable 
when certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional  they are written off against this allowance 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate and the tax bases of assets and liabilities are based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable 
deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are established when it is deemed  more likely than not  that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  
table of contents including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
firstly  americans are eating more avocados 
over the last years  united states us consumption of avocados has expanded at a compound annual growth rate and we do not anticipate this growth significantly changing 
we believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the united states contributes to such growth  as avocados  which are cholesterol and sodium free  are dense in fiber  vitamin b  antioxidants  potassium  folate  and contain unsaturated fat  which help lower cholesterol 
also  a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients  which avocados are rich in  help fight chronic illnesses  such as heart disease and cancer 
additionally  we believe that the demographic changes in the us will greatly impact the consumption of avocados and avocado based products 
the hispanic community currently accounts for approximately of the us population  and the total number of hispanics is estimated to triple by the year avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers  as the per capita avocado consumption in mexico is estimated to be more than seven fold that of the us we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by growth in the hispanic community and general acceptance in american cuisine 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace  including imported and california grown fruit 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our california avocado and international avocado businesses 
during fiscal  
table of contents and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board related to california avocados 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience 
the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales fresh products processed products total net sales as a percentage of net sales fresh products processed products net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  increased by approximately million  or  principally as a result of an increase in both our fresh products and processed products segments 
the increase in sales related to our fresh products segment was primarily driven by an increase in our average selling price  partially offset by a decrease in the total pounds sold 
the increase related to our processed products segment was primarily related to an increase in both the total pounds sold  as well as an increase in the average selling price per pound

table of contents fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in mexican and chilean avocado sales and an increase in tomato sales  partially offset by a decrease in california avocado sales 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of mexican fruit sold increased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily in the us marketplace and was substantially related to an increased emphasis in the mexican avocado crop certified for export to the us  which principally stemmed from the expected  and ultimately realized  smaller california avocado crop 
additionally  the average per carton selling price of mexican avocados increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the smaller california avocado crop in the marketplace during fiscal  as well as the premium pricing related to our proripevip tm avocado ripening program 
sales of chilean sourced avocados increased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold increased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to the size of the chilean avocado crop  as well as the timing of the delivery to the united states 
our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  of chilean avocados experienced a decrease of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute some of these price fluctuations to the size and or timing of delivery of the chilean and california avocado crop in the marketplace during fiscal mexican and chilean grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
we anticipate that the combined sales of mexican and chilean grown avocados will remain comparable in fiscal the volume of non brokered tomatoes increased by approximately million pounds during fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase  which accounted for the majority of the fluctuation  was primarily related to a new supplier relationship 
we expect a significant increase in tomato sales during fiscal due primarily to our new tomato agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sales of california sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this decrease was primarily related a decrease in pounds of avocados sold  partially offset by an increase in our average selling prices 
the decrease in pounds was primarily related to a cyclically low california avocado crop for the season  coupled with the freeze experienced during our first fiscal quarter 
our market share of shipped california avocados decreased to for fiscal  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
based on estimates generated from the california avocado commission  we expect the california avocado crop for the season to be moderately larger than the crop 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were higher when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the aforementioned smaller california avocado crop for the season 
for fiscal year  we believe that the demand for california avocados will remain strong in the us marketplace  and  as a result  such is expected to have a positive impact on sales prices 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in california avocados sales  partially offset by a decrease in mexican and chilean avocado sales 
sales of california sourced avocados increased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this increase was primarily related to a increase in pounds of avocados sold  partially offset by a decrease in our average selling prices 
this increase in pounds sold was consistent with the expected increase in the overall harvest of the california avocado crop for the season 
our market share of california avocados remained consistent at for the year ended october   compared to for the same period in the prior year 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were lower when compared to the same prior year period 
this pricing structure primarily reflects the impact of a larger california avocado harvest  as well as a 
table of contents increase in the sale of grade two hass avocados in proportion to grade one hass avocados sales 
grade two hass avocados generally sell for significantly less than grade one hass avocados 
sales of mexican sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in pounds of mexican avocados sold  due primarily to the large california crop discussed above 
our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  of mexican avocados experienced a marginal decrease of for fiscal when compared to the same prior period 
sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in pounds of chilean avocados sold 
this decrease was primarily related to the size of the chilean avocado crop  as well as the timing of the delivery to the united states 
our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  of chilean avocados experienced a marginal increase of for fiscal when compared to the same prior period 
sales of papayas decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of papaya fruit sold 
this decrease was primarily related to adverse weather conditions negatively affecting the current year papaya crop 
such decrease  however  was partially offset by an increase in average selling prices of papayas  on a per carton basis  which increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase in average selling prices to significantly fewer pounds sold in the us marketplace 
processed products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to an increase of million pounds of product sold  or  as well as an increase in the net selling price totaling per product pound sold  or 
during fiscal year  the increase in pounds sold primarily relates to an increase in the sale of both our frozen and high pressure guacamole products  which increased approximately and when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in our net average selling price primarily relates to a change in our product mix 
we currently have two l ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan and estimate we are operating at approximately of the combined machines capacities as of october  we believe the additional capacity provided by the nd machine is reasonable given our current sales projections and expected growth 
net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and we believe that these ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers 
consequently  we believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  high end salsas  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period

consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  remained consistent for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this consistency was principally attributable to decreased profitability in our processed product segment  substantially offset by an increase in profitability from our fresh products segment 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this increase was principally attributable to increased profitability in fresh products segment  as well as our processed product segment 
gross margins and gross profit percentages related to california avocados are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  and the volume of avocados packed 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage during fiscal year was primarily related to a significant decrease in pounds of fruit sold  as well as an increase in the market price of avocados 
during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  we experienced a decrease in pounds of avocados sold 
additionally  we also experienced a increase in the average sales price of california avocados 
combined  these had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
the increase in our gross margin percentage related to california avocados during fiscal year was primarily related to a significant increase in pounds of fruit sold  partially offset by an increase in the cost of fruit 
during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  we experienced a increase in pounds of avocados sold 
this had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including chilean avocados and tomatoes  is dependent on the volume of fruit we handle and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party 
accordingly  the gross margin results for these products are a function of the volume handled and the competitiveness of the sales prices that we realize 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years   and  we generated gross margins of million  million  and million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
our business with mexican growers differs in that we operate a packinghouse in mexico and purchase avocados directly from the field 
alternatively  we may also purchase mexican avocados directly from co packers located in mexico as well 
in either case  the gross margin and gross profit percentages generated by our mexican operations are significantly impacted by the volume of avocados handled by our packinghouse and the cost of the fruit 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados increased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year such increase was primarily related to a increase in the volume of mexican avocados sold  as well as higher sales prices of mexican fruit 
collectively  these items positively affected gross margins 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year such decrease is primarily related to both the significant decrease in the volume of mexican avocados sold  totaling primarily related to the large california crop discussed above  as well as an increase in mexican fruit costs 
collectively  these items contributed to a higher per pound cost  which negatively affected gross margins 

table of contents gross margins and gross profit percentages for our processed products business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages decreased primarily as a result of higher fruit costs  as well as increased packaging costs  both of which had the effect of increasing our per pound costs 
such were partially offset  however  by an increase in total pounds produced  which had the effect of reducing our per pound costs 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our processed product segment will continue to experience fluctuations during the next fiscal year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will be used in the production process 
during fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period  the processed products gross profit percentages increased primarily as a result of lower fruit costs and increases in total pounds produced  both of which had the effect of reducing our per pound costs
