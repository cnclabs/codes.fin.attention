the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs aimed at large market opportunities 
our proprietary drug development pipeline includes clinical candidates that are designed to treat patients afflicted with cancer  inflammatory diseases and pain 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies collaborate with us to discover and develop drug candidates across a broad range of therapeutic areas 
our six most advanced  wholly owned programs in our development pipeline are as follows arry  a p inhibitor and pan cytokine modulator for inflammation and for pain  arry  a mek inhibitor for inflammation  arry  a p tie dual inhibitor for cancer and or inflammation  arry  an erbb family efgr erbb inhibitor for cancer  arry  a ksp inhibitor for cancer  and arry  an erbb inhibitor for cancer 
we also have a portfolio of discovery programs that we believe will generate one to three ind applications each year 
our discovery efforts have also generated additional early stage drug candidates that we may choose to out license through research partnerships prior to filing an ind application 
we have built our proprietary pipeline of research and development programs on an investment of approximately million from our inception through june  over the past three years  research and development expenses have significantly increased year over year to support our clinical development efforts and were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal additionally  we have received a total of million in research funding and in up front and milestone payments from our collaboration partners through june  under our existing collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn billion additional milestone payments if we achieve all the drug discovery objectives detailed in these agreements  as well as the potential to earn royalties on any resulting product sales from drug development programs 
our largest existing collaborators include astrazeneca  which licensed three of our mek inhibitors for cancer  including azd arry  which is currently in multiple phase clinical trials  genentech  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with us to develop two of our cancer programs which has been expanded to include two additional cancer programs all four of which are in preclinical development  and celgene  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with us focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation 

table of contents we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the near future as we continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery programs 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our fiscal year ends on june each year 
when we refer to a fiscal year  we are referring to the year in which the fiscal year ends 
therefore  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended june  business development and collaborator concentrations we currently license or partner certain of our compounds and or programs and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we license our compounds and enter into collaborations in japan through an agent 
the collaborators that contributed in excess of of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years is as follows years ended june  genentech celgene ono ventirx intermune astrazeneca in general  certain of our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with to days prior notice 
our agreement with genentech can be terminated with days notice 
celgene may terminate its agreement with us with six months notice 
our agreement with ono ended in april the following table details the countries from which we derive in excess of of our revenue in each of the last three fiscal years based on the country in which collaborators are located or the ship to destination for compounds years ended june  us japan sweden all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilites 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical 
table of contents experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies and estimates that we believe involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition most of our revenue is derived from designing  creating  optimizing  evaluating and developing drug candidates for our collaborators 
our agreements with our collaboration partners include fees based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project  and may also include non refundable license and up front fees  non refundable milestone payments that are triggered upon achievement of specific research or development goals  and future royalties on sales of products that result from the collaboration 
a small portion of our revenue comes from fixed fee agreements or from sales of compounds on a per compound basis 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
arrangements that include multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  to determine whether the element has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether reliable evidence of fair value for the delivered elements exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria of eitf are treated as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting as defined in staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
sab in turn established four criteria  each of which must be met  in order to recognize revenue related to the performance of services or the shipment of products 
revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement  which is generally the research term specified in the agreement 
these advance payments are deferred and recorded as advance payments from collaborators upon receipt  pending recognition  and are classified as a short term or long term liability on our balance sheet 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research term  the specific number of full time equivalent scientists working a defined number of hours per year at a stated price under the agreement  the existence or likelihood of development commitments  and other significant commitments of ours 
similarly to advance payments  for agreements that provide for milestone payments  a portion of each milestone payment is recognized as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage of the estimated research term that has elapsed to the total estimated research term 
revenue recognition related to non refundable license fees and up front payments and to milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
revenue from sales of compounds in our lead generation library and optimer building blocks is generally recognized as the compounds are shipped 
we recognize revenue based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project on a monthly basis as work is performed 
we determined that the performance period applicable to our agreement with celgene corporation is seven years ending september  and we determined the performance period for our agreement with ventirx to be one year 
each of these periods coincides with the research terms specified in each agreement 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments and license fees 
to date  there has not been a significant change in an estimate or assumption of the expected period of performance that has had a material effect on the timing or amount of revenue recognized 

table of contents in february  we entered into a collaboration and licensing agreement with ventirx in which we received a non refundable cash technology access fee and shares of preferred stock valued at million based on the price at which such preferred stock was sold to investors in a private offering 
both the technology access fee and the value of the preferred stock were recorded as advance payments from collaborators and deferred revenue  and were recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated one year research term 
the preferred stock has been recorded in other long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
cost of revenue and research and development for proprietary drug discovery cost of revenue represents research and development conducted for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
we allocate these costs between cost of revenue and research and development for proprietary drug discovery based upon the respective time spent on each by our scientists on development conducted for our collaborators and for our internal proprietary programs  respectively 
where our collaboration agreements provide for us to conduct development of drug candidates  and for which our partner has an option to obtain the right to conduct further development and to commercialize a product  we attribute a portion of our research and development costs to cost of revenue based on the percentage of total compounds under the agreement that may be selected by the partner 
for example  we granted to celgene an option to select up to two of four drugs developed under the collaboration 
accordingly  we report costs associated with the celgene collaboration as follows to cost of revenue  with the remaining to research and development for proprietary drug discovery 
see the further discussion on this transaction in note to the accompanying financial statements 
investments in marketable securities our investments in marketable securities include domestic public corporate debt securities  commercial paper issued by domestic public companies  obligations of us federal government agencies and auction rate securities  or ars 
marketable securities are classified as short term or long term based on the nature of these securities and the availability of these securities to meet current operating requirements 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of  with realized gains and losses reflected in interest income or interest expense  as appropriate in the accompanying financial statements 
temporary impairments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying balance sheets and other than temporary impairments are recognized in impairments of marketable securities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
all of our investments in marketable securities are held in our name at a limited number of financial institutions 
included within long term marketable securities are our investments in ars 
during the fiscal year ended june  and subsequent thereto  auctions for all of our ars  amounting to seven securities with a par value of million  were unsuccessful 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million on two of our ars  primarily as a result of the continuous decline and magnitude of the fair value discount from par value  which is due in part to the relative weakness in the performance of the underlying trust assets 
accordingly  the other than temporary impairment is recorded in impairment of marketable securities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
we believe that impairment in the other five ars in the portfolio  amounting to million  is temporary  primarily because of stronger performance of the underlying trust assets  the relatively smaller discount of fair value from par value  and because these securities have not incurred significant continuous declines in fair value during recent periods 
accordingly  the temporary impairment is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying balance sheets as of june  while we now earn a higher contractual interest rate on these ars investments  the investments are not currently liquid 
in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until auctions of these investments are successful  the original issuers retire these securities or a secondary market develops for these securities 
therefore  they are classified as marketable securities long term in the accompanying balance sheets as of june  
table of contents preclinical study and clinical trial outsourcing accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party medical centers or contract research organizations  which we refer to collectively as cros 
some cros bill monthly for services performed  while others bill based upon milestone achievement 
we accrue expenses each month for agreements involving significant costs and that bill based on milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  accruals are based upon the estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for costs for clinical study activities performed by cros  accruals are estimated based upon the estimated work completed on each study and  for clinical trial expenses  accruals are based upon the number of patients enrolled and the expected duration of the study for which they will be enrolled 
we monitor patient enrollment and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with the cros  clinical site visits  and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are highly dependant upon the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by our cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive concerning changing circumstances  conditions or events that may affect such estimates 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
income taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not we will not recover these deferred assets  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that we believe a valuation allowance is required  we must include and expense the tax effect of the allowance within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
results of operations revenue collaboration revenue consists of revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
a summary of our revenue follows amounts in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
collaboration revenue license and milestone revenue total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million due to the expiration of collaborations with intermune and takeda in june and march of  respectively  as well as the expiration of our collaboration with ono during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  collaboration revenue from the sale of optimer building blocks decreased by approximately thousand compared to fiscal partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue of approximately thousand from our collaborations with ventirx and genentech 
collaboration revenue is expected to further decline in fiscal as we continue to focus on our own discovery and development programs 
license and milestone revenue increased by approximately thousand due to increased revenue of million from our collaborations with celgene and ventirx 
largely offsetting this increase was the full recognition of two milestone payments totaling million from astrazeneca during fiscal as discussed below 

table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal collaboration revenue declined by million due to the expiration of collaborations with astrazeneca  roche and eli lilly during fiscal as well as the research portions of collaborations with intermune and takeda that expired in fiscal additionally  collaboration revenue from the sale of optimer building blocks and lead generation libraries decreased by million during these same periods 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue of million from our collaborations with genentech and ono  as well as the initiation of a new research agreement with ventirx 
license and milestone revenue declined by million during fiscal because previously received license and milestone payments from astrazeneca and genentech had been fully recognized as revenue as of june  this decrease was partially offset by the recognition of two milestone payments totaling million from astrazeneca during fiscal for the advancement of azd into phase clinical trials and arry into phase clinical trials 
additional license and milestone revenue of million was recognized in fiscal from ventirx  intermune and eli lilly 
cost of revenue cost of revenue represents research and development conducted for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
fine chemicals consumed as well as any required inventory reserve adjustments are also recorded as cost of revenue 
a summary of our cost of revenue follows amounts in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
cost of revenue cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue for fiscal decreased from fiscal as a result of a reduction in the number of scientists working on external collaborations that expired in the prior fiscal year 
these scientific resources were shifted to our proprietary drug research and the celgene collaboration upon expiration of these external collaborations 
half of the research related costs of the celgene program is charged to cost of revenue  as discussed further in note to the accompanying financial statements 
we expect an additional decline in future periods as a result of the expiration of our collaboration with ono during the fourth quarter of fiscal during july and august  we terminated our prior facilities leases and executed new lease agreements with a new landlord 
as a result of this transaction  we reversed a million deferred rent liability balance and reduced our rent expense by the same amount 
because we allocate rent expense  the reduction in rent expense resulted in a decrease to cost of revenue of approximately thousand for fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue for fiscal decreased by from fiscal  primarily reflecting a decrease in collaboration related services as a greater percentage of our resources were focused on advancing our proprietary drug discovery programs 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for the fiscal year compared with for the prior fiscal year 
these decreases were largely the result of increased average pricing received from collaborations for full time equivalent scientists during fiscal resulting in fewer scientific resources used in generating the same approximate level of collaboration revenue 
additionally  share based compensation expense charged to cost of revenue for fiscal year decreased by approximately thousand due to options that became fully vested in the prior fiscal year 
on june   we assigned options we owned to purchase our boulder and longmont  colorado facilities to biomed realty lp  which purchased those facilities in july and august we entered into new lease 
table of contents agreements for these facilities with biomed over a ten year lease term and began amortizing our leasehold improvement costs for these facilities over a ten year life 
prior to completing these transactions  we had determined that we were reasonably assured during fiscal that we would be vacating our boulder facility at the end of the initial lease term in march and therefore amortized the cost of leasehold improvements for that facility over an approximate two year life 
we determined the lease terms under our new facilities leases to be the fixed  non cancelable ten year term because we concluded that the exercise of optional extension periods available under the leases was not reasonably assured 
this conclusion was based on our experience with prior lease facilities and management s determination that it was unable to predict in the early years of a long term lease whether it would remain in the facilities beyond the initial lease term as a result of changing business  economic or other conditions 
the change in the amortization period from two to years resulted in a decrease of approximately thousand in amortized leasehold improvement costs charged to cost of revenue for fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery our research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and share based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible 
however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis 
the following table shows our research and development expenses by categories of costs for the periods presented amounts in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
salaries  benefits and share based compensation outsourced services and consulting laboratory supplies facilities and depreciation other total research and development for proprietary drug discovery fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased over the prior fiscal year as a result of the deployment of existing scientific personnel previously engaged in our external collaborations to advance our proprietary research 
in addition  we expanded our clinical development group and moved into more advanced clinical trials and increased the amount of outsourced pharmacology to advance our proprietary development compounds 
the most significant increases resulted in the advancement of the following programs arry  a p inhibitor and pan cytokine modulator for inflammation and for pain  arry  a mek inhibitor for inflammation  arry  a p tie dual inhibitor for cancer and or inflammation  arry  an erbb family efgr erbb inhibitor for cancer  arry  a ksp inhibitor for cancer  and arry  an erbb inhibitor for cancer 
during fiscal  we expensed million of share based compensation expense as compared to million for fiscal we expect that research and development for proprietary drug discovery spending will continue to 
table of contents increase in fiscal as we focus more resources on our proprietary drug discovery and development programs and advancing our programs through clinical development 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses increased over the prior fiscal year as a result of increases in the number of scientists devoted to proprietary programs  reflecting both increased headcount as well as a shift of existing scientific resources from collaborative projects to internal proprietary discovery 
the most significant increase in costs came from outsourced pharmacology studies and clinical trial related expenses supporting the advancement of our erbb egfr  mek for inflammation  erbb  p tie and other programs 
during fiscal we expensed million of share based compensation expense to research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in leasehold improvement amortization and rent expense allocated to research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses as described in cost of revenue above 
the change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements resulted in a reduction of amortization of leasehold improvement costs charged to research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses for the fiscal year of approximately thousand 
additionally  the reversal of the prior year deferred rent balance resulted in a reduction to rent expense allocated to research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses for the fiscal year of approximately thousand 
as discussed in the section above entitled business proprietary development programs  we have multiple programs in different phases of preclinical and clinical development 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate 
the lengthy process of developing and testing a drug candidate  seeking regulatory approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources that generally increase as the candidate moves through the development process 
although we expect our research and development costs to increase as we progress our programs through later stage development  the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
the successful development and commercialization of drugs resulting from our proprietary programs is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control 
the duration and cost of discovery  preclinical  non clinical and clinical trials may vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of a product and are difficult to predict 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  non clinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity or be susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
consequently  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of revenue or research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 

table of contents a summary of our general and administrative expenses follows amounts in thousands years ended june  change vs 
change vs 
general and administrative fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million during the fiscal year over the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased compensation and benefit expenses of million associated with the addition of general and administrative personnel 
audit  legal and other consulting expenses increased by approximately thousand as a result of increased legal and audit fees for general corporate matters and strategic consulting 
other general and administrative expenses associated with increased personnel  such as travel and office related costs make up the remaining increase of approximately thousand 
fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately thousand during the fiscal year over the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased share based compensation expense of approximately thousand recognized upon the vesting of option shares in the prior fiscal year 
as described in cost of revenue above  the change in estimated useful life of our leasehold improvements resulted in a reduction of amortization of leasehold improvement costs charged to general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year of approximately thousand and the reversal of the prior year deferred rent balance resulted in a reduction to rent expense allocated to general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year of approximately thousand 
partially offsetting all these decreases in general and administrative expenses were increases in patent and patent application costs of approximately thousand for the fiscal year associated with the advancement of our propriety drug development programs 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses of thousand from the prior year was attributable to increases in compensation and benefit expenses

interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher effective interest rates and higher average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased borrowings and higher effective interest rates related to our long term borrowings 
we expect interest expense to increase as a result of our credit facility entered into in april with deerfield

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations through revenue from our collaborations and the issuance of debt and of equity securities 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the rate at which we invest in proprietary research  the growth of our clinical development capabilities  the growth or decline of our collaboration business and the amount of collaboration research funding we receive  the timing of milestone and royalty payments  if any  from our collaboration and out licensed programs  our capital spending on new facilities and equipment  the number and size of phase and phase clinical trials we decide to run  expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition and technological developments  general economic and market conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements may be impacted if we do not receive potential milestone or royalty payments under our existing or future collaboration agreements 
our ability to realize these payments is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain  and we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  our collaborators have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create  the sale and manufacture of drug candidates we develop may not obtain regulatory approval  and  if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone  royalty revenue or product revenue from the commercialization of these drugs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  credit facilities and anticipated cash flow from existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
this estimate of our future capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the progress of our research and development activities  our ability to enter into agreements to out license and co develop our proprietary drug candidates  and the timing of those agreements in each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research and development programs  the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the number and scope of phase and phase studies we may decide to run  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  the availability of resources for revenue generating collaborations as we devote more resources to our proprietary programs  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration agreements  the ability of our collaborators to fund research and development programs  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and the costs of establishing clinical development and distribution or commercialization capabilities 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we expect to continue to utilize our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our credit facilities and equity offerings and from our collaborations 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining new or in retaining existing out license or collaboration agreements  in securing agreements for the co development of our proprietary drug candidates  or in receiving milestone and or royalty payments under those agreements  that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of 
table of contents development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices  the liquidity of our ars  and interest rates 
all of our collaboration agreements and nearly all purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  historically and as of june   we have had little or no exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency or exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities 
the investment portfolio is comprised primarily of readily marketable  high quality securities diversified and structured to minimize market risks while providing a reasonable return on invested funds 
as of june   million of our investment portfolio is invested in ars that are not marketable 
we target our average portfolio maturity at one year or less 
nevertheless  the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to changes in market value in response to changes in interest rates and liquidity 
in addition  a significant change in market interest rates could have a material impact on interest income earned from our investment portfolio 
given the current balance of million of investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities available for sale  a theoretical basis point change in interest rates and security prices would impact our net income loss positively or negatively by approximately million 
our long term marketable securities investment portfolio includes ars 
during the fiscal year ended june  and subsequent thereto  auctions for all of our ars  amounting to seven securities with a par value of million  were unsuccessful 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million on two of our ars  primarily due the continuous decline and magnitude of the fair value discount from par value  which is due in 
table of contents part to the relative weakness in the performance of the underlying trust assets 
we believe that impairment in the other five ars in the portfolio  amounting to million  is temporary  primarily because of stronger performance of the underlying trust assets  the relatively smaller discount of fair value from par value  and because these securities have not incurred significant continuous declines in fair value during recent periods 
if credit market liquidity conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional temporary or other than temporary impairments of our ars  which could adversely affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings 
in the event we need to access any of our ars  we will not be able to do so until auctions of these investments are successful  the original issuers retire these securities or a secondary market develops for these securities 
we are also impacted by adverse changes in interest rates relating to variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility with comerica bank 
we pay interest on advances under our loan agreement at one of three variable rates  which are adjusted periodically for changes in the underlying prevailing rate 
changes in prevailing interest rates will affect the fair value of our debt  and will impact future results of operations and cash flows 
as of june   we had million of long term debt outstanding  exclusive of the debt discount of million  of which million is under our variable rate term loan and equipment advance facilities 
the variable rate is adjusted based on changes in the bank s prime lending rate 
the interest rate on the remainder of our long term debt is fixed 
assuming constant debt levels  a theoretical change of basis points on our current interest rate of as of june  would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately thousand 
historically  and as of june   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
