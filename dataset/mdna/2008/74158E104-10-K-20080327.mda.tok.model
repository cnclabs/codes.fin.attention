item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the company s subsidiaries are defined in note of the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million in the prior year 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf or damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production through the use of financial instruments 

table of contents we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing 
the company has in place both a stock repurchase program and a limited partnership interest repurchase program 
spending under these programs in was million 
the company expects to expend a similar amount in the company currently maintains two credit facilities totaling million  with a combined current borrowing base of million 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial covenants defined in the agreement 
we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
it is the goal of the company to increase its oil and gas reserves and production through the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
the company also continues to explore and consider opportunities to further expand its oilfield servicing revenues through additional investment in field service equipment 
however  the majority of the company s capital spending is discretionary  and the ultimate level of expenditures will be dependent on the company s assessment of the oil and gas business environment  the number and quality of oil and gas prospects available  the market for oilfield services  and oil and gas business opportunities in general 
critical accounting estimates proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account

income tax expense of  in represents a effective rate as compared to the effective rate of in the primary reason for the lower effective rate was higher percentage depletion deductions 
these deductions which create a permanent difference are more significant as a percentage of book income when book income is lower  as it was in current tax expense in was  with the remainder being attributable to an increase in the company s deferred tax liability 
the current federal tax expense for is below the statutory rate because the company is allowed to deduct currently  rather than capitalize  intangible drilling costs as incurred

gain on sale and exchange of assets decreased to  in from  in this decrease reflects the non recurring gain recognized during related to the following transaction 
in august  the company completed a transaction involving its interests in certain offshore gulf of mexico properties effective april  the partners transaction 
prime offshore llc  prime offshore formerly f w oil exploration llc  a subsidiary of the company  entered into a limited partnership agreement the partners agreement  wherein prime offshore is the general partner of fwoe partners lp partners formed for the acquisition  development and operation of oil and gas properties and pipelines  equipment  facilities and fixtures appurtenant thereto  in offshore gulf of mexico the properties 
prior to entering into the partners agreement  prime offshore had distributed interests in the properties to the minority shareholders of prime offshore and the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of such minority shareholders for  resulting in the company s ownership of prime offshore 

table of contents prime offshore contributed all of its interest in the properties to partners in exchange for an initial general partner interest in partners and a cash distribution of million 
partners purchased the interests previously distributed to the former minority shareholders for million 
the entire million expended by partners was funded by a cash contribution by the limited partner 
the cash distribution includes adjustments for estimated net revenues from the effective date of april   estimated capital expenditures and other typical closing adjustments 
to record this transaction  the company applied the guidance of eitf  non monetary transactions magnitude of boot and the exceptions to the use of fair value 
in this transaction  the boot was significant in excess of of the fair value of the exchange  therefore  the transaction was treated as a monetary transaction with the assets recorded at fair value 
the company recorded proceeds of million consisting of cash of million and the fair market value of the general partner interest of million 
the related properties had a book value of million resulting in the recognition of an million gain 
the fair market value of the general partner interest was determined by calculating of the total agreed value of all properties acquired by partners 
the company uses the proportionate consolidation method of accounting for its interest in partners under the guidance of eitf as related to the extractive industries 
income tax expense of  in represents a effective rate as compared to the effective rate of in at higher rates of income  the company s percentage depletion deductions  which are currently its only major permanent difference  become less significant as a percentage of income 
current tax benefit in was  with the remainder being attributable to an increase in the company s deferred tax liability 
the primary reason that the company s current federal tax expense for is below the statutory rate is that the company is allowed to deduct currently  rather than capitalize  intangible drilling costs as incurred 
the current deduction of these costs  which are capitalized for financial accounting purposes  is also the primary reason for the increase in the company s deferred tax liability between and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its line of credit  which has variable rates based upon the lenders base rate  as defined  and the london inter bank offered rate 
based on the balance outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  derivative instruments and hedging activity 
our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
please read the discussion below and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
hedges on production collars 
from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under the collar arrangements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index price falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
in the case of a three way collar  if the index price rises above the third tier price  the counterparty pays us 

table of contents hedges on production swaps 
from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under the swap agreements  if the index price rises above the swap price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index falls below the swap price  the counterparty pays us 
at december  we had open crude oil price collar contracts covering our   and production as follows crude oil price collar contract period volume in mbbl weighted average price floor ceiling third tier per bbl net unrealized loss gain in thousands first quarter first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter first quarter second quarter second quarter third quarter third quarter fourth quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter full year 
table of contents at december   we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering our and production as follows natural gas price swaps contract period volume in mmcf weighted average price per mcf net unrealized gain in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter full year we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
the preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses  which may be impacted both by production and by changes in future market prices of energy commodities
