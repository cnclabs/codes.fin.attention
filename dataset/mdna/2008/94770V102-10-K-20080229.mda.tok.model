introduction our company we are a leading provider of health information services to consumers  physicians and other healthcare professionals  employers and health plans 
we have organized our business into two operating segments as follows online services 
we own and operate both public and private online portals 
our public portals enable consumers to become more informed about healthcare choices and assist them in playing an active role in managing their health 
the public portals also enable physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve their clinical knowledge and practice of medicine  as well as their communication with patients 
our public portals generate revenue primarily through the sale of advertising and sponsorship 
table of contents products  including continuing medical education cme services 
our sponsors and advertisers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and consumer products companies 
we provide information and services that enable employees and members  respectively  to make more informed benefit  treatment and provider decisions through our private portals for employers and health plans 
we also provide related services for use by such employees and members  including lifestyle education and personalized telephonic health coaching as a result of the acquisition of summex on june  we generate revenue from our private portals through the licensing of these portals to employers and health plans either directly or through distributors 
we also distribute our online content and services to other entities and generate revenue from these arrangements through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products and content syndication fees 
the company also provides e detailing promotion and physician recruitment services for use by pharmaceutical  medical device and healthcare companies as a result of the acquisition of medsite on september  publishing and other services 
we provide several offline products and services the little blue book  a physician directory  and webmd the magazine  a consumer targeted publication launched in early that we distribute free of charge to physician office waiting rooms 
until december   we published acp medicine and acs surgery principles of practice  our medical reference textbooks 
we generate revenue from sales of the little blue book directories and advertisements in those directories  and sales of advertisements in webmd the magazine 
we also conducted in person medical education through december   as a result of the acquisition of the assets of conceptis technologies  inc in december until december   we also published medical reference textbooks 
we sold this business in and it has now been reflected as a discontinued operation in our financial statements 
our publishing and other services segment complements our online services segment and extends the reach of our brand and our influence with health involved consumers and clinically active physicians 
significant developments sale of acp medicine and acs surgery 
as of december   the company entered into an asset sale agreement and completed the sale of certain assets and certain liabilities of our medical reference publications business  including the publications acp medicine and acs surgery principles and practice 
the assets and liabilities sold are referred to below as the acs acp business 
acp medicine and acs surgery are official publications of the american college of physicians and the american college of surgeons  respectively 
the company will receive net cash proceeds of  consisting of  received in january and  which will be received through june  the company incurred approximately of professional fees and other expenses associated with the sale of the acs acp business 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized a gain of  investment in auction rate securities backed by federally guaranteed student loans 
as of february   webmd had investments of approximately million in certain auction rate securities which we refer to as ars 
the types of ars investments that webmd owns are backed by student loans  of which are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and all had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
webmd does not own any other type of ars investments 
the interest rates on these ars investments are reset every days by an auction process 
historically  these types of ars investments have been highly liquid 
in mid february  auctions for ars investments backed by student loans failed  including auctions for the ars investments held by webmd 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars investments continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
webmd believes that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing its ars investments has not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these ars investments 
as a result of these recent events  webmd is in the process of evaluating the extent of any impairment in its ars investments resulting from the current lack of liquidity  however  it is not yet able to quantify the amount of any impairment 
webmd believes that the lack of liquidity relating to its ars investments will not have an impact on its ability to fund its current operations 

table of contents hlth merger 
on february   hlth and webmd entered into a merger agreement  pursuant to which hlth will merge into webmd which we refer to as the hlth merger  with webmd continuing as the surviving company 
in the hlth merger  each outstanding share of hlth common stock will be converted into shares of webmd common stock and in cash  subject to a downward adjustment as described below which we refer to as the merger consideration 
the shares of webmd class a common stock currently outstanding will remain outstanding and will be unchanged in the hlth merger 
the hlth merger will eliminate both the controlling class of webmd stock held by hlth and webmd s existing dual class stock structure 
the terms of the merger agreement were negotiated between hlth and a special committee of the board of directors of webmd 
the merger agreement was approved by the board of webmd based on the recommendations of the special committee and by the board of hlth 
the cash portion of the merger consideration will be funded from cash and investments at webmd and hlth  and proceeds from hlth s anticipated sales of its vips and porex businesses 
as previously announced  hlth has received significant interest from potential strategic buyers for both vips and porex and will be seeking formal offers for these businesses from potential buyers 
the cash portion of the merger consideration is subject to downward adjustment prior to the closing  based on the amount of proceeds received from the disposition of hlth s investment which excludes the portion held by webmd in certain ars  which  under the terms of the merger agreement  must be liquidated by hlth prior to closing of the merger 
we cannot predict  at this time  the amount of such downward adjustment 
see investment in auction rate securities backed by federally guaranteed student loans above 
if either vips or porex has not been sold at the time the hlth merger is ready to be consummated  webmd may issue up to million in redeemable notes to the hlth shareholders in lieu of a portion of the cash consideration otherwise payable in the merger 
the notes would bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable in kind annually in arrears 
the notes would be subject to mandatory redemption by webmd from the proceeds of the divestiture of the remaining vips or porex business 
the redemption price would be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of the redemption 
completion of the merger is subject to hlth and webmd receiving required shareholder approvals  a requirement that the surviving company have an amount of cash  as of the closing  at least equal to an agreed upon threshold  calculated in accordance with a formula contained in the merger agreement  completion of the sale by hlth of either vips or porex and the sale of hlth s ars investments  and other customary closing conditions 
hlth  which owns shares of webmd constituting approximately of the total number of votes represented by outstanding shares  has agreed to vote its shares of webmd in favor of the merger 
the transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of following the hlth merger  webmd as the surviving corporation will assume the obligations of hlth under hlth s convertible notes due september  and hlth s convertible subordinated notes due june  collectively referred to as notes 
in the event a holder of these notes converts these notes into shares of hlth common stock pursuant to the terms of the applicable indenture prior to the effective time of the hlth merger  those shares would be treated in the hlth merger like all other shares of hlth common stock 
in the event a holder of the notes converts those notes pursuant to the applicable indenture following the effective time of the hlth merger  those notes would be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration payable in respect of the hlth shares into which such notes would have been convertible 
background information on certain trends and strategies several key trends in the healthcare and internet industries are influencing the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends  and the strategies we have developed in response  are described briefly below use of the internet by consumer and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians 
table of contents find and utilize healthcare information 
as consumers are required to assume greater financial responsibility for rising healthcare costs  the internet serves as a valuable resource by providing them with immediate access to searchable and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  assess risks  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
the internet has also become a primary source of information for physicians seeking to improve clinical practice and is growing relative to traditional information sources  such as conferences  meetings and offline journals 
increased online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion of this amount is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of our advertisers and sponsors  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will result in increasing demand for our services 
changes in health plan design  health management initiatives 
in a healthcare market where a greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision making has been increasingly shifting to consumers  use of information technology including personal health records to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased 
we believe that through our webmd health and benefits manager tools  including our personal health record application  we are well positioned to play a role in this consumer directed healthcare environment  and these services will be a significant driver for the growth of our private portals during the next several years 
however  our growth strategy depends  in part  on increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer and health plan clients employees and members  respectively 
increasing usage of our services requires us to continue to deliver and improve the underlying technology and develop new and updated applications  features and services 
in addition  we face competition in the area of healthcare decision support tools and online health management applications and health information services 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be better known than we are 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our businesses from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 
basis of presentation our company is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering ipo of class a common stock on september  our class a common stock has traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol wbmd since september  and now trades on the nasdaq global select market 
prior to the date of the ipo  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hlth and our consolidated financial statements had been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of hlth  principally representing the webmd segment  using the historical results of operations  and historical basis of assets and liabilities of the webmd related businesses 
since the completion of the ipo  we are a majority owned subsidiary of hlth  which currently owns of our equity 
our class a common stock has one vote per share  while our class b common stock has five votes per share 
as a result  our class b common stock owned by hlth represented  as of december   of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock

table of contents on march   we acquired healthshare  which provides online tools that compare the cost and quality measures of hospitals for use by consumers  providers and health plans 
we acquired healthshare for a total purchase consideration of approximately  comprised of  in cash  net of cash acquired and of acquisition costs 
the results of operations of healthshare are included in our online services segment beginning march   the closing date of the acquisition 
seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
advertising and sponsorship revenue within our online services segment is seasonal  primarily due to the annual budget approval process of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
our private portal licensing revenue is historically higher in the second half of the year as new customers are typically added during this period in conjunction with their annual open enrollment periods for employee benefits 
finally  the annual distribution cycle within our publishing and other services segment results in a significant portion of our revenue in this segment being recognized in the second and third quarter of each calendar year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  much of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of prepaid advertising  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and web site development costs  the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts  certain accrued expenses and contingencies  share based compensation to employees and transactions with hlth 
we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as related health coaching services are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
in certain instances where fair 
table of contents value does not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized when the last element is delivered 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in  and investments 
our investments  at december   consisted of money market funds and investments in certain ars 
all of our investments were classified as available for sale and were carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses associated with available for sale securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary if we do not have the intent and ability to retain the investment until any anticipated recovery in market value 
the cost of securities is based on the specific identification method 
as discussed in more detail above in introduction significant developments  during mid february  auctions for ars investments backed by student loans failed  including auctions for the ars investments we held 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars investments continue to bear interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing its ars investments have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these ars investments 
as a result of these recent events  we are in the process of evaluating the extent of any impairment in our ars investments resulting from the current lack of liquidity  however  we are not yet able to quantify the amount of any impairment 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as fasb issued sfas no 
 revised share based payment which we refer to as sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which we refer to as sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the service period generally the vesting period in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas r on january  and elected to use the modified prospective transition method and as a result  prior period results were not restated 
under the modified prospective method  awards that were granted or modified on or after january  are measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested stock options and restricted stock awards that were granted prior to january  will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  using the same grant date fair value and same expense attribution method used under sfas  except that all awards are recognized in the results of operations over the remaining vesting periods 
the impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized for all stock based compensation beginning january  as of december   approximately and  of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested awards net of estimated forfeitures is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
table of contents and years  related to the hlth and our stock based compensation plans 
the total recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation expense for both the hlth and our stock based compensation plans is approximately four years  however  the majority of this cost will be recognized over the next two years  in accordance with our vesting provisions 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in this model are expected dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
the expected volatility for stock options to purchase hlth common stock is based on implied volatility from traded options of hlth common stock combined with historical volatility of hlth common stock 
prior to august   expected volatility for stock options to purchase our class a common stock was based on implied volatility from traded options of stock of comparable companies combined with historical stock price volatility of comparable companies 
beginning on august   expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options of our class a common stock combined with historical volatility of our class a common stock 
deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
at december  and  we had nol carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively  on a separate return basis 
at december  and  we had nol carryforwards of  and  respectively  on a legal entity basis 
this amount reflects the utilization of approximately  by the hlth consolidated group as a result of the sale of certain hlth businesses 
subject to certain limitations  these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
until the quarter ended december   a full valuation allowance had been provided against all net deferred taxes  except for a deferred tax liability originating from business combinations that resulted in tax deductible goodwill 
during the quarter ended december   after consideration of the relevant positive and negative evidence  we reversed a portion of our valuation allowance primarily through the tax provision 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and  in the future should management determine that realization of the net deferred tax asset is more likely than not  some or all of the remaining valuation allowance will be reversed  and our effective tax rate may be reduced by such reversal 
transactions with hlth 
as discussed further below  our expenses reflect a services fee for an allocation of costs for corporate services provided by hlth 
our expenses also reflect the allocation of a portion of the cost of hlth s healthcare plans and the allocation of stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and other stock based compensation 
our sales and marketing expense reflects an allocation to hlth for the utilization by it of advertising services available to us from news corporation 
we are included in the consolidated federal tax return filed by hlth 
during february and september  we received reimbursements of  and  respectively  pursuant to our tax sharing agreement related to our nol carryforwards utilized by hlth in connection with gains related to the sale of certain hlth businesses 
additionally  our revenue includes revenue from hlth for services we provide 
transactions with hlth in connection with the ipo in september  we entered into a number of agreements with hlth governing the future relationship of the companies  including a services agreement  a tax sharing agreement and an indemnity agreement 
these agreements cover a variety of matters  including responsibility for certain liabilities  including tax liabilities  as well as matters related to hlth providing us with administrative services  such as payroll  accounting  tax  employee benefit plan  employee insurance  intellectual property  legal and information processing services 
under the services agreement  we have agreed to reimburse hlth an amount that reasonably approximates hlth s cost of providing services to us 
hlth has agreed to make 
table of contents the services available to us for up to five years  however  we are not required  under the services agreement  to continue to obtain services from hlth and are able to terminate services  in whole or in part  at any time generally by providing  with respect to the specified services or groups of services  days prior notice and  in some cases  paying a nominal termination fee to cover costs relating to the termination 
the terms of the services agreement provide that hlth has the option to terminate the services that it provides for us  in whole or in part  if it ceases to provide such services for itself  upon at least days written notice to us 
on january   we entered into additional agreements with hlth in which both parties agreed to support each other s product development and marketing efforts of specific product lines for agreed upon fees as defined in the agreements 
the new agreements cover a term of five years 
on february   the tax sharing agreement was amended to provide that hlth will compensate us for any use of our nols that may result from certain extraordinary transactions  as defined in the tax sharing agreement  including the sales by hlth of its emdeon business services which we refer to as ebs and emdeon practice services which we refer to as eps operating segments 
on september   hlth completed the sale of eps for approximately  in cash which we refer to as eps sale 
on november   hlth completed the sale of a interest in ebs for approximately  in cash which we refer to as ebs sale 
hlth recognized a taxable gain on the sale of eps and ebs and utilized a portion of its federal nol carryforwards to offset the gain on these transactions 
under the tax sharing agreement between hlth and us  we were reimbursed for our nol carryforwards utilized by hlth in these transactions at the current federal statutory rate of 
during february  hlth reimbursed us  as an estimate of the payment required pursuant to the tax sharing agreement with respect to the eps sale and the ebs sale  which was subject to adjustment in connection with the filing of the applicable tax returns 
during september  hlth finalized the nol carryforward attributable to us that was utilized as a result of the eps sale and ebs sale and reimbursed us an additional  these reimbursements were recorded as capital contributions which increased additional paid in capital at december  and september   respectively 
on february   hlth announced that it had executed a definitive agreement and closed the sale of its minority interest in ebs to an affiliate of general atlantic llc and investment funds managed by hellman friedman llc 
the sale price was  in cash 
hlth expects to recognize a taxable gain on this transaction and expects to utilize a portion of its federal nol carryforward to offset a portion of the tax liability resulting from this transaction 
the amount of the utilization of the nol carryforward and related reimbursement to us is dependent on numerous factors and cannot be determined at this time 
the consolidated financial statements include allocations for the following charges from the company to hlth revenue 
our revenue includes revenue from hlth for services we provide to other hlth businesses for licensing of our private portal services  revenue for licensing of our database of physicians  and advertising by hlth in the little blue book  our physician directory 
we record these revenues at rates comparable to those charged to third parties for comparable services 
advertising expense 
during  we allocated costs to hlth based on its utilization of our advertising services 
this charge included a proportional allocation based on the number of hlth operating segments identified in each advertisement and an allocation of cost to hlth for the promotion of the webmd brand prior to hlth s name change 
on august   hlth and other businesses of hlth began to use emdeon as their primary brand  instead of webmd 
in may  as a result of the ebs sale  hlth began to use hlth as their primary brand  instead of emdeon 
accordingly  we no longer allocate any advertising expense to hlth  or other businesses of hlth  related to any advertising that promotes the webmd brand 
our portion of the advertising services utilized is included in sales and marketing expense within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and is reported net of amounts charged to hlth

contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our principal commitments as of december  for future specified contractual obligations that have not been accrued for in our consolidated balance sheet  as well as the estimated timing of the cash payments associated with these obligations 
management has used estimates and assumptions as to the timing of the cash flows associated with these commitments 
management s estimates of the timing of future cash flows are largely based on historical experience  and accordingly  actual timing of cash flows may vary from these estimates 
less than more than total year years years years in thousands leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price  quantity and delivery 

table of contents the above table excludes of uncertain tax positions  under fin  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of these items 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this annual report 
potential future cash commitments not included in the specified contractual obligations table above or accrued for in our consolidated balance sheet include our anticipated capital expenditure requirements which we currently estimate at  to  our anticipated capital expenditures relate to improvements that will be deployed across our public and private portal web sites in order to enable us to service future growth in unique users  page views and private portal customers  as well as to create new sponsorship areas for our customers 
outlook on future liquidity our liquidity during is expected to be significantly impacted as a result of the planned hlth merger see introduction significant developments 
the planned merger with hlth will result in the payment of up to in cash for each outstanding share of hlth corporation as of the closing date of the merger 
the cash portion of the merger consideration will be funded from cash and investments at the company and hlth  as well as cash proceeds from hlth s anticipated divestitures of porex and vips 
additionally  if either porex or vips has not been sold at the time the hlth merger is ready to be consummated  the company could issue up to  in redeemable notes to the hlth stockholders in lieu of a portion of the cash consideration otherwise payable in the merger 
as of february   the company and hlth had approximately billion in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of which we had approximately  in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
also as of february   and as discussed in more detail in the beginning of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see introduction significant developments  the company and hlth owned approximately  of ars investments  of which we owned approximately  of ars investments 
in mid february  auctions for ars investments backed by student loans failed  including auctions for the ars investments we held 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars investments continue to bear interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
we believe that any lack of liquidity relating to our ars investments will not have an impact on our ability to fund our operations 
we believe that our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations  will provide sufficient cash resources to meet the commitments described above and to fund our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for up to twenty four months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  our existing and new application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments  and potential future acquisitions 
in addition  our ability to generate cash flow is subject to numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic  regulatory and other matters affecting us and our customers 
we plan to continue to enhance the relevance of our online services to our audience and sponsors and continue to invest in acquisitions  strategic relationships  facilities and technological infrastructure and product development 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations which we refer to as sfas r  a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
sfas r provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  sfas r changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  would have to be met at the acquisition date 
while there is no expected impact to our consolidated financial statements on the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to december   the adoption of sfas r on january  could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to that date 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas which we refer to as sfas  which permits but does not require us to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as we do not expect to elect to fair value any of our financial instruments under the provisions of sfas  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have any impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which we refer to as sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value 
sfas also expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position b which we refer to as fsp b which delays the effective date of sfas for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas and fsp b are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of sfas under the provisions of fsp b related to the measurement of fair value used when evaluating goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment and valuing asset retirement obligations and liabilities for exit or disposal activities 
the impact of partially adopting sfas effective january  is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and various types of marketable securities
