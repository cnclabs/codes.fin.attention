our cash and short term investments continued to grow  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments amount were almost million  an increase of million from the end of short term investments include auction rate securities currently impacted by nationwide illiquidity due to effects of the sub prime lending crisis in the us our company returned to profitability in  posting net income of  or per share 
last year  intangibles impairment charges of million contributed to a loss of million  or per share 
there were no impairment charges in our gross profit margin improved to in compared to in  most of the improvement was in the brands segment 
this improvement was due  in part  to a more profitable sales mix in compared to that in and better utilization of inventory to reduce purchases 
cost increases  particularly in oil based products and freight increases  depressed the margin improvement 
we have experienced cost increases from many vendors 
freight costs have increased as vendors have added various surcharges to their pricing structure 
as of january   we have instituted price increases to attempt to pass through to our customers the cost increases that we have been subject to from our vendors 
selling general and administrative sg a expenses declined by million in compared to those in  primarily due to the inclusion in of million for intangibles impairments an additional million was classified as an impairment of goodwill 
in and sg a expenses included in each year approximately  of manufacturing related costs 
our company sells thousands of different items to various distributors  beauty schools and individuals 
in the distributor segment  we generally buy and resell several thousand beauty and barber items 
in the brands segment  we produce and sell more than one thousand items 
revenue was soft in both of our segments brands and distributors as general economic conditions  lower beauty school enrollments and distributor consolidation were factors in our overall revenue decline from that in revenue in our brands segment  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in  was down from that in within our brands segment  we did see growth compared to in our frances denney cosmetics line and in the ethnic markets 
revenue in our distributors segment  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in  was lower than that in we anticipate that the slowing growth of the us economy may affect our business adversely  principally in the first half of revenue is likely to decline from levels and profitability may be impacted adversely 
restatement of interim financial statements as disclosed in our form k and form qsb filings for various interim periods in  a former manager unilaterally and clandestinely misstated the results of operations at one our subsidiaries for the first six months of his actions resulted in the unintentional issuance of erroneous results by us for the first two quarters of we detected the results of the manager s actions and corrected the previously filed results in the third quarter form qsb for this subsidiary s corrected results are included in the distributors segment in note to these consolidated financial statements 
the total effect of the event was an overstatement of reported revenue  net income and net income per share for the first six months of of   and per share  respectively 
the misstatements have been corrected and the applicable filings have been amended with restated results 
v 
results of operations ebitda exclusive of impairment charges in was approximately million compared to approximately breakeven in our cash continued to grow as well the cash and cash equivalents balance was almost million at the end of  an increase of million from that at the end of we had a loss of million  or per share in due to a non cash charge of million or approximately million after tax benefit for intangibles impairment in our brands segment 
without this non cash charge we would have shown an operating profit of  in compared to the reported operating loss 
without this impairment charge our earnings per share would have approximated 
the impairment charges were required by sfas no 
of the financial accounting standards board 
this pronouncement eliminated the amortization of goodwill and trademarks but required companies to determine annually if the carrying amount of such goodwill and trademarks exceeded its fair market value 
sfas mandates the use of methodologies that involve estimates and assumptions 
we recorded the write off for book purposes only  we did not get a tax deduction in for this write off 
our gross profit margin improved to in from in the increase came principally in the brands segment and resulted from a better product mix and improved inventory utilization resulting in lower purchases 
operating expenses for included impairment charges of million which  along with the separately shown goodwill write off of million  comprised a total impairment charge of million 
operating expenses for exclusive of impairment charges were less than those in as a result of favorable spending variances in the areas of payroll  legal  rent and promotions 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  a total of million 
although we have long term debt of million  this debt is fully funded by restricted cash which is over and above our cash and cash equivalents 
our company generated cash of million from operating activities  both of our segments generate cash and are profitable before the allocation of corporate overhead 
cash flow increases occur because operating income  plus the favorable effect of minimal income taxes  exceeds dividends 
our largest use of cash was for dividends which we have paid since mid  we also paid a special dividend of per share in of  capital expenditures were not significant 
we reclassified our auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
the auction rate securities are currently illiquid as the bond market restructures to cash out short term holders such as us with proceeds from longer term bond holders 
despite having million of auction rate securities  we have cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have adequate liquidity and do not foresee the need for additional capital for day to day operations 
our cash balance will vary with growth or decline in operating income and changes  if any  in dividends 
we are building cash now  in part  as a result of paying minimal income taxes due to taxable losses in and at december   we had approximately million before taxes of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
in  we paid a dividend of  or about million 
this caused a significant  one time  reduction in cash 
since  cash and short term investments have grown steadily 
cash is driven by operating income which we endeavor to manage by keeping expenses low  competitively bidding purchases and freight costs  developing new products  searching out new markets or expanding existing markets through new product offerings to existing customers  updating technology in critical customer service areas  reducing purchases by utilizing existing inventory when possible  increasing selling prices to the extent possible and centralizing administrative functions 
as the overall economy expands and contracts  or as we gain or lose customers  our cash flow will vary because we have  especially in the brands segment  high variable gross margins  and an increase or decrease in this segment could be significant to overall results 
we expect a softening of demand in and a consequent reduction in operating income 
cash may be adversely impacted by these events 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements
