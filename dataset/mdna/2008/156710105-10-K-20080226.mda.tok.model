the table below shows the percentage contribution to our total sales to external customers of each market application in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial automotive diesel commercial total 
table of contents the principal factors contributing to our recent growth in sales are increased demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers and our acquisition of esk ceramics in august the operations of esk ceramics have been consolidated with ours since september  in addition  the market for ceramic body armor increased further in with the introduction of enhanced side ballistic inserts  known as esbi  which protect the side of the soldier s torso 
military conflicts in iraq and afghanistan  as well as an increasingly unstable geopolitical climate and the heightened risk of international conflicts  have resulted in increased orders for our ceramic body armor in each year since we were awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract by the us army in august with an adjusted maximum value of million from an original estimated contract value of million 
through february  we received sixteen delivery orders equaling the contract amount 
we expect to complete the delivery of this adjusted contract amount during we have also received a number of other orders for ceramic body armor  not covered by the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract  from the army and other branches of the us military 
in january  we received our first production order for esbi  or side plates  which are designed to protect the side areas of a soldier s torso when used in conjunction with our esapi ceramic body armor plates 
this delivery order  which totaled million  was issued to us by the us army 
in june  we were awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract by the us army with a maximum value of million for esbi plates 
through february  delivery orders totaling approximately million have been issued to us under this contract 
based on our current backlog for ceramic body armor  we expect our shipments of ceramic body armor to be lower in fiscal year than in moreover  government contracts typically may be cancelled by the government at any time without penalty 
for the next several quarters  and perhaps longer  demand for ceramic body armor is likely to be the most significant factor affecting our sales 
in response to a solicitation notice from the us army regarding the next ballistic threat generation of body armor  we submitted our quotation for this procurement in february this procurement  like most government procurements for ceramic body armor  will be awarded in an open competitive bidding process 
we cannot be certain when the military will make awards under this procurement  or whether or to what extent we will be one of the successful bidders 
although we believe that demand for ceramic body armor will continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget appropriations and the level of international conflicts 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on the us military s continued demand for these products and our ability to successfully compete for and retain this business 
in july we entered into an agreement with ideal innovations  inc and oshkosh truck corporation to further develop  produce and market an armored military vehicle we call the bull tm 
the bull tm armored vehicle is intended to address the increasing need for protection from improvised explosive devices  known as ieds  mine blasts and high threat  explosively formed projectiles  known as efps  and will be built on a combat proven oshkosh truck chassis 
the bull tm armored solution  conceived by ideal innovations in and developed with ceradyne in  has been tested by the army test center  aberdeen  maryland  and demonstrated to be capable of protecting vehicle occupants against ied  efp and mine blast threats 
it is designed to meet current ied threats  and is intended to withstand the increasingly prevalent and higher efp threats now faced by the us military 
in september  in response to a solicitation notice from the us military regarding mine resistant ambush protected vehicles ii enhanced vehicle competitive  known as mrap ii  we  together with ideal innovations and oshkosh truck  submitted a quotation and delivered both a person and a person mrap ii vehicle named the bull tm  to the us army aberdeen test center for further service evaluation 
in december  the us government awarded a delivery order totaling million to ideal innovations  ceradyne and oshkosh truck for several person versions and targets of the bull tm armored vehicle to be used for further government testing 
ideal innovations is the prime contractor and we are a sub contractor to ideal innovations 
whether we receive additional orders for the bull tm armored vehicle will depend upon the success of these tests  the us military s need and funding for mrap ii armored 
table of contents vehicles  the results of testing of a competitor s mrap ii armored vehicle  and whether our pricing for the bull tm armored vehicle is competitive 
ceradyne s design and production contribution to the bull tm armored vehicle program is based on our experience and expertise learned over many years in developing ceramic armor systems for military helicopters  ground based vehicles and boats 
due to the ballistic threat level that mrap ii armored vehicles are required to meet  the current design of the bull tm armored vehicle does not include any ceramic armor 
although we are engaged in development of ceramic armor systems to use on future versions of the bull tm armored vehicle  we do not know when or if a ceramic armor solution will be available or whether it would be acceptable to the us military 
our esk ceramics subsidiary produces boron carbide powder  which serves as a starter ceramic powder in the manufacture of our lightweight ceramic body armor 
owning this source of our principal raw material  together with the recent expansion of our manufacturing capacity for ceramic armor at our new lexington  kentucky plant and in our irvine  california facility  should allow us to fulfill current and anticipated demand for our ceramic body armor 
our order backlog was million as of december  and million as of december  orders for ceramic armor represented approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december  and million  or of the total backlog as of december  we expect that substantially all of our order backlog as of december  will be shipped during our sales to customers located outside of the united states have varied in recent years  representing million  or of net sales in  million  or during and million  or in we currently have sales offices in germany  china  england and canada as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
of our sales to customers located outside the united states  were denominated in us dollars during net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenues from the sale of products  which we recognize when an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses  which we also include in cost of product sales 
the cost of electricity comprises a significant portion of our cost of product sales 
in  we began expanding our high energy utilization silicon nitride manufacturing operations at our new facility in lexington  kentucky  where costs  particularly for electricity and occupancy  are lower than in california 
we have increased our manufacturing capacity for the production of body armor plates by adding three hot press lines at this new facility 
we chose this facility for the location of the hot press expansion for the same reasons lower cost of electricity and occupancy 
the cost of electricity for our manufacturing operations in the united states and europe was approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  and approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in selling expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 

table of contents research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response to customer requirements  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
review of historical stock option grant procedures in july  the company voluntarily initiated a review of its historical stock option grant practices and related accounting treatment 
the review was conducted by a special committee comprised of three independent members of the company s board of directors  with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic accounting experts 
the scope of the special committee s review included all stock options granted by the company from january through september the special committee has completed its review 
until september  stock option grants generally were approved by unanimous written consents signed by the members of the stock option committee of the board of directors 
throughout this period  the stock option committee consisted of the ceo and one other non management director 
the date specified as the grant date in each unanimous written consent was used i to determine the exercise price of the options and ii as the accounting measurement date 
the review found that from january through september  the date selected by management as the grant date and accounting measurement date was the date specified in the unanimous written consent  but that  in all but one case  the unanimous written consents were not prepared  approved or executed by the company s stock option committee until a later date 
there were a total of grant dates from january through september the company s ceo was responsible for selecting the grant dates and followed a consistent practice of seeking low grant prices and he was unaware of the accounting implications of the method he used 
therefore  the use of the date specified in the unanimous written consent as the accounting measurement date was incorrect in all but one case 
the proper accounting measurement date was the date the unanimous written consent was signed by the members of the stock option committee 
based upon information gathered during the review by independent legal counsel  the special committee and the board of directors have concluded that  while the company applied an option price date selection practice that resulted in the use of incorrect accounting measurement dates for options granted between january and september  the accounting errors resulting from the use of incorrect measurement dates were not the product of any deliberate or intentional misconduct by the company or its executives  staff or board of directors 
however  as a result of using revised measurement dates for options granted from january through september  the company recorded a charge in the second quarter ended june  of million million after income taxes pertaining to the years ended december  to and the six months ended june  the stock based charge 
the stock based charge was included as a component of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income as this is where the affected individual s normal compensation costs are recorded 
the stock based charge includes non cash compensation expense of million million after income taxes primarily related to stock option grants made during the period from january through september that should have been measured as compensation cost at the actual stock option grant dates  and subsequently amortized to expense over the vesting period for each stock option grant 
the stock based charge also includes million million after income taxes of estimated additional employment and other taxes that are expected to become payable 
from september to february  all stock option grants were approved at meetings held by the stock option committee  and  since february  all stock option grants have been approved at meetings held by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
the dates of these meetings have been used correctly as the accounting measurement date for all stock options granted since september had this estimated stock based charge been reflected  as and when incurred  in the company s results of operations for prior years  the impact on net income for ceradyne s fiscal years ended december would have been a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a 
table of contents reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  a reduction of  in  and a reduction of  in as of december   the total remaining incremental stock based compensation charge related to these stock option grants that are expected to vest in future periods with a revised accounting measurement date is immaterial 
there was no impact on revenue or net cash provided by operating activities as a result of the estimated compensation charge 
the company does not believe that a restatement of its prior period financial statements is required for the stock based charge 
based on the materiality guidelines contained in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality sab  the company believes that the stock based charge is not material to any of the individual prior periods affected and the aggregate stock based charge is not material to the results for the year ended december  prior to december   the current members of ceradyne s board of directors  all current executive officers and all other employees of the company amended all unexercised stock options they held which had an exercise price that is less than the price of the company s common stock on the actual date of grant  by increasing the exercise price to an amount equal to the closing price of the common stock as of the actual grant date 
the company has and will continue to reimburse all non executive officer employees for the increase in the exercise price for the modified options as they vest 
such reimbursement has and will not be material 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items from our financial statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of net sales

research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was higher armor sales that did not require a proportional increase in research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   expenses for the development of next generation body armor products and the continuing development of vehicle armor primarily accounted for the increase in research and development expenses 

table of contents other income expense

table of contents for each  principal amount of the notes which represents a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are convertible only under certain circumstances  including if the price of our common stock reaches  or the trading price of the notes falls below  specified thresholds  if the notes are called for redemption  if specified corporate transactions or fundamental change occur  or during the trading days prior to maturity of the notes 
we may redeem the notes at any time after december   for a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest as described below  if any  up to but excluding the redemption date 
with respect to each  principal amount of the notes surrendered for conversion  we will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows an amount in cash equal to the lesser of a the aggregate conversion value of the notes to be converted and b  and if the aggregate conversion value of the notes to be converted is greater than  an amount in shares or cash equal to such aggregate conversion value in excess of  the notes contain put options  which may require us to repurchase in cash all or a portion of the notes on december   december   december   december   and december  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest as described below  if any  to but excluding the repurchase date

the amount of contingent interest payable per note for any relevant contingent interest period shall equal per annum of the average trading price of a note for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant contingent interest period 
in december  we established an unsecured million bank line of credit 
as of december   there were no outstanding amounts on the line of credit 
however  the available line of credit at december  has been reduced by outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million 
the interest rate on the credit line is based on the libor rate for a period of one month plus a margin of percent  which equaled percent as of december  there is an additional charge per quarter based on a ratio of funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
for the quarter ended december   based on this ratio the additional charge for the unused portion of the credit line amounted to percent of the undisbursed portion of the credit line 
pursuant to the bank line of credit  the company is subject to certain covenants  which include  among other things  the maintenance of specified minimum amounts of tangible net worth and quick assets to current liabilities ratio 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million  compared to million at december  our cash position includes amounts denominated in foreign currencies  and the repatriation of those cash balances from our esk ceramics subsidiary does not result in additional tax costs 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash available from the sale of short term investments  cash available from additional borrowings under our revolving line of credit and cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our anticipated capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our anticipated capital requirements primarily relate to the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in the united states  china and germany 
we also may utilize cash  and  to the extent necessary  borrowings from time to time to acquire other businesses  technologies or product lines that complement our current products  enhance our market coverage  technical capabilities or production capacity  or offer growth opportunities

off balance sheet arrangements the only off balance sheet arrangement is the conversion feature of our convertible senior subordinated notes discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which begin on page f of this report 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any temporary or other than temporary impairment of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
sales recognition 
sales are recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue with 
table of contents reserves for sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  are based upon historical sales returns 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due based on contractual terms 
a write off will occur if the settlement of the account receivable is less than the carrying amount or we ultimately determine the balance will not be collected 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the financial statements included in this report beginning on page f inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal for long lived assets sfas long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill is not being amortized  but instead is subject to an annual assessment of impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year 
goodwill is allocated to six reporting units  which represent the company s operating segments 
the company s reporting units for purposes of applying the provisions of sfas are advanced ceramics operations  semicon associates  thermo materials  esk ceramics  ceradyne canada and ceradyne boron products 
sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to the carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
at december   no impairment of goodwill had occurred 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the economic consumption method 

table of contents pension 
the company provides pension benefits to its employees of its subsidiaries of esk ceramics and ceradyne boron products 
for the pension plans of both subsidiaries  we make several assumptions that are used in calculating the expense and liability of the plans 
these key assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
in selecting the expected long term rate of return on assets  we consider the average future rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits under the pension plans 
this includes considering the plans asset allocations and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of this plan 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which an amount that is invested in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments would provide the future cash flows necessary to pay benefits when they come due 
in addition the expense and liabilities of the plan were determined using other assumptions for future experience  such as mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
our actual results could differ materially from those we estimated  which could require us to record a greater amount of pension expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree

eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is evaluating the impact of this standard and currently does not expect it to have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than two years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
our long term investments at december  included million of auction rate securities net of a temporary impairment charge of million against other comprehensive income and an other than temporary impairment charge of million against current earnings 
the company s investments in auction rate securities represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or credit cards  insurance securitizations and other structured credits  including corporate bonds 
these auction rate securities are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
during the second half of the year  the auctions for these securities failed 
as a result of current negative conditions in the global credit markets  auctions for the company s investment in these securities have recently failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid through the normal auction process and may be liquid if a buyer is found outside the auction process 
we review impairments associated with the above in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf and fsp sfas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other than temporary 
we believe that a portion of the impairment of our auction rate securities investments is temporary and a portion is other than temporary 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio is days  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse 
table of contents movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classify short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are available for current operations 
we are not exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt as it is fixed rate debt 
consequently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments regarding our debt 
foreign currency fluctuations we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management team to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges 
we measure the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenues  costs and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income miscellaneous
