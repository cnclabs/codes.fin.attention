item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview as a holding company of various product and service entities  we have historically invested in businesses that we believe are undervalued or underperforming  and or in operations that are poised for significant growth 
management s strategic focus is to support the growth of its operations by increasing revenues and revenue streams  managing costs and creating earnings growth 
our operations are largely decentralized from the corporate office 
autonomy is given to subsidiary entities  and there are few integrated business functions ie sales  marketing  purchasing and human resources 
day to day operating decisions are made by subsidiary management teams 
our corporate management team assists in operational decisions when deemed necessary  selects subsidiary management teams and handles capital allocation among our operations 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in  restructured in and redomesticated to the state of indiana in may prior to  we conducted business mainly in the entertainment industry 
we classify our businesses under five operating segments business solutions  wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet technologies  and electronics integration 
effective november   we approved the sale of all of our remaining operating subsidiaries within four of our five segments wireless infrastructure  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet infrastructure  and electronics integration 
consequently  as of the effective date of the transaction  our business solutions segment is the company s remaining operating segment 
the sales transaction combined with other significant events disclosed in note of our financial statements in item  will change the focus of our company in fiscal and thereafter 
this operational change in our company will impact the comparability of our financial information compared to historical data presented in past filings 

table of contents key factors affecting or potentially affecting results of operations and financial condition management considers the following factors  events  trends and uncertainties to be important to understanding its results of operations and financial condition holding company over the past five fiscal years  we have completed six key acquisitions 
four of these key acquisitions have been in the peo industry 
in february  the company acquired pem  a peo located in arizona 
in march  the company acquired esg  a peo located in utah and colorado 
the company s acquisition of esg enabled the company to expand its geographic presence in the peo marketplace  and has made the company one of the three largest public peos in the country 
in april  we acquired csm  a peo located in nashville  tennessee 
this acquisition of the oldest peo in the state expanded our business solutions segment service offerings 
in april  we acquired jh drew  a construction installer of highway products and commercial structural steel 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the transportation infrastructure business in the midwestern united states 
in october we acquired psm  a peo located in indianapolis  indiana 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the peo market 
in july we acquired nor cote  a specialty ink manufacturer with worldwide distribution channels 
this acquisition allowed us to gain entry into the ultraviolet ink business 
there are several key factors that have affected or potentially may affect our results of operations including the following earnings are dependent on a number of factors including our ability to execute operational strategies and integrate acquired companies into our existing operations 
our historical growth has been due to several significant acquisitions over the past five years 
future growth in revenues and earnings may not increase at the same rate as historical growth 
we have current and long term debt liabilities of million 
principal payments of million and estimated interest payments of approximately million are due within months 
the ability to meet financing needs may affect future management strategies 
certain expenses  such as wages  benefits and rent  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self funded medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
typically  the first  third and fourth quarter represent the best quarters for our consolidated financial results 
these results are attained due to our investment in the construction industry 
we maintain a solid working relationship with all of our unions and good employee relations are a focus of our management 
although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
a control group  which includes our two majority shareholders  owns of the outstanding common stock of the company as of december  as a result  these people could have a controlling influence in determining the outcome of any corporate matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations  election of directors and any other significant corporate actions 
the interests of these shareholders may differ from the interests of the company s other shareholders and their stock ownership may thereby limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the management and affairs of the company 
business solutions we continue to expand service offerings in addition to our payroll services  including human resource outsourcing  employment training and testing 
the majority of customer operations are concentrated in the arizona  colorado  indiana  tennessee and utah markets 
financial results may be affected by changes in the state regulatory environments  results under our partially self funded health and partially self funded workers compensation insurance plans  and economic conditions 
wireless infrastructure we deliberately reduced the size and scope of these businesses due to the large losses incurred by these businesses 
the losses were incurred primarily due to our inability to efficiently match our number of employees with the construction and technical services workload 
we did not receive the anticipated number of jobs and the jobs that we did receive were often delayed or cancelled 
these businesses are beginning to perform successfully and we believe they will continue to grow in the future 
transportation infrastructure financial results continue to fluctuate as a result of federal and state funding for highway safety projects  changes in steel and fuel prices  market conditions and competition 
most of our jobs are competitively bid 
we face the continual challenge of being the lowest and best bidder in order to get the job 
we also face the challenge of not underbidding the job with the result that we lose money on the job or do not attain our desired profit margin 
the loss of even one big job due to us not being the lowest and best bidder can have a substantial impact on our revenues 
we are continuously affected by weather conditions and commodity price fluctuations 
operations within this segment continue to expand beyond strictly highway safety products to commercial steel erection 
although this segment is subject to significant volatility  we expect continued growth 

table of contents ultraviolet technologies we expect continued growth in our ultraviolet technologies segment 
future growth is dependent on raw material and product availability and pricing  research and development initiatives  attracting new customers with new products  and our ability to continue to deliver consistent  high quality product 
the increased competition in our domestic and foreign markets requires us to stay price competitive 
we are also affected by our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other technical personnel 
our new chemist has assisted with some product quality issues 
in his short tenure  he has already made a positive impact 
we are also in the process of expanding our manufacturing capacity in singapore 
we see major growth opportunities in china and singapore 
electronics integration we expect continued growth in our electronics integration segment by expanding our distribution business to include non electronic products 
we have developed many contacts in china as a result of trips to china as part of our ultraviolet technologies business 
we believe that we can import various products from china and sell these products using our existing distribution network 
our future financial success will largely be dependent on our ability to maintain preferred pricing with our vendors  availability of products from our vendors  industry consolidation  economic conditions  and the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as is common in the industries in which we operate  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include transactions with related parties  liabilities associated with guaranties  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees 
transactions with related parties we have entered into various acquisition agreements over the past four years that contain option agreements between the sellers and our majority shareholder  mr 
carter fortune  related to the company s stock obtained by the sellers through the acquisitions 
the option agreements provide for put call options on the company s common stock held by the sellers 
the put call options range in price from to per common share 
the shareholders of csm exercised their put sale rights by executing the sale of  shares of company stock at per share to mr 
fortune and mr 
fisbeck during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the members of pem currently have put rights in regards to  shares

when these leases were originally executed  the leases contained provisions whereby the rental rates could be adjusted to fair market value 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the company s lease obligations 
effective november   we believe ffd will no longer be required to consolidate as a variable interest entity due to the triggering event described in note in item no 
guaranties a significant portion of our debt and surety bonds are personally guaranteed by the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
it is very unlikely that the company could have obtained such debt without the personal guarantees 
if the chairman of the board and chief executive officer decide not to continue their personal guarantees or decide not to make additional personal guarantees  it will significantly limit the company s ability to obtain financing and would have a material adverse effect upon the company 
as of august   the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer had personally guaranteed company debt in the amount of million 
as of august   the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer had personally guaranteed company debt in the amount of million

restricted cash certain states and vendors require us to post letters of credit to ensure payment of taxes or payments to our vendors under health insurance and workers compensation contracts and to guarantee performance under our contracts 
such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
we do not believe that it is likely that any claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
as of august   we had approximately million in restricted cash primarily to secure obligations under our peo contracts in the business solutions segment 
payment and performance bonds within our wireless infrastructure and transportation infrastructure segments  certain customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post payment or performance bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
under our continuing indemnity and security agreement with the surety  we have posted letters of credit in the amount of million in favor of the surety and  with the consent of our lenders under our credit facility  we have granted security interests in certain of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety 
we expect this letter of credit in favor of the surety to be reduced in the future 
to date  we have not been required to make any reimbursements to the surety for bond related costs

goodwill and other intangible assets the company has adopted sfas no 
with the adoption of sfas  material goodwill included in the company s business solutions  transportation infrastructure  ultraviolet technologies and electronics integration segments was assessed for impairment 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill and other intangible assets valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated or understated 

table of contents the company has elected to perform the annual impairment test of recorded goodwill as required by sfas as of the end of fiscal fourth quarter

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performances and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual segment discounted cash flows to the asset segment carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
these assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

this amount was a release of of the transportation infrastructure segment and of the business solutions segment 
in and  the company recorded a valuation allowance on additions to net deferred tax assets due to renewed uncertainty regarding future profitability of the company based on its respective losses 
in addition  management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdictions and to consider this when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
a one percent change in the company s overall statutory tax rate for would not have a material effect in the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities
