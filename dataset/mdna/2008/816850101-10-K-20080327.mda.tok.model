overview we design  develop and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer  consumer product  communications and industrial markets for a wide variety of end applications 
computer end market applications include notebook and desktop computers  computer graphics  personal digital assistants pdas and servers 
products within the communications market include products for set top boxes  local area networks  metro and wide area networks  cellular phones and base stations 
industrial and other applications include military and aerospace equipment  power supplies  hearing aids and other medical devices  meter reading and factory automation systems and automated test equipment ate 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including apple  cisco  hewlett packard  ibm  intel  lg electronics  motorola  nortel  phonak  quanta computer  samsung  siemens  rim  and sony 

table of contents we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  depreciation on fixed assets used in the manufacturing process  shipping costs  direct labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many customers include liberal cancellation provisions in their purchase orders 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
sales made directly to customers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
we divide and operate our business based on two reportable segments standard semiconductor products and rectifier  assembly and other products 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
we do not track balance sheet items by individual reportable segments 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data below operating income 
the standard semiconductor products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management  protection  test and measurement  and advanced communications and sensing ac s product lines 
it also includes the small human interface device hid product line  which we are exiting 
the rectifier  assembly and other products segment includes our line of power discrete products  such as assembly and rectifier devices 
this is the product line on which we were founded to supply the military and aerospace market 
our business involves reliance on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  taiwan  malaysia  korea  the philippines  germany  israel and canada 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon  in terms of cost of wafers purchased  was manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in europe  canada  and mexico 
acquisition on june   we acquired through our wholly owned swiss subsidiary  semtech international ag  all of the outstanding shares of xemics sa xemics in a cash for stock transaction pursuant to a share purchase and sales agreement 
following the acquisition we changed the name of the company from xemics sa to semtech neuchatel sa semtech neuchatel 
semtech neuchatel is a research and development intensive company based in switzerland that applies low power  low voltage design expertise across its core technologies  namely sensor interfacing data acquisition  bit risc microcontrollers  radio frequency transceivers and audio converters 
these capabilities are aimed at adding value in next generation  highly integrated battery powered wireless and sensing applications 
semtech neuchatel  which continues to operate from its switzerland location  is part of our advanced communication and sensing ac s product line and is included in the standard semiconductor products segment 
the former xemics shareholders made certain representations  warranties and covenants with respect to the financial condition of xemics and other matters 
a portion of the purchase price was not immediately disbursed to the selling shareholders but was held in escrow for fifteen months after the closing to ensure the availability of some funds in the event liability attached to the selling shareholders as a result of a breach of the representations and warranties 
this 
table of contents fifteen month escrow period ended in september no claims were made against this escrow account and the escrowed funds were released to the selling shareholders 
however  six of the selling shareholders continue to remain liable for five years after the closing as to certain representations related to organization  capital structure  and tax matters 
the share purchase and sales agreement provides for certain conditions and limitations on the selling shareholders liability 
we continue to monitor and assess whether there are any qualifying items in excess of the threshold for making a claim against the six selling shareholders 
any successful claim will be accrued as a reduction of the cost of the acquisition 
consistent with purchase accounting treatment of the acquisition  we included xemics results of operations subsequent to the close of the transaction on june  in our consolidated results of operations 
we also assumed the assets and liabilities of xemics as of the closing date 
during the second quarter of fiscal year a one time acquisition related charge to earnings of million was recorded for the write off of in process research and development 
from the close date of june  until the end of our fiscal year on january   we incurred  of expense for amortization of other intangible items 
the remaining million balance of other intangible items as of end the end of fiscal year will be amortized over future periods 
the amount amortized in fiscal year was million 
there are no tax related benefits from these acquisition related costs 
insurance settlements in march  we announced that we had resolved a customer dispute 
the terms of the settlement agreement called for the company to pay the customer million in cash in fiscal years and at the time of the customer settlement  we stated that we would vigorously pursue insurance coverage for the full value of the settlement 
we subsequently filed lawsuits against  and reached settlement with  three of our insurance companies 
we reached settlements with two of the three insurance companies in the second quarter of fiscal year and reported a million gain for these insurance settlements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reached settlement with the third insurance company and recorded a million gain which is included in the consolidated statements of income in insurance recovery legal expenses  net 
all amounts due under this settlement have been received as of march  legal fees and expenses related to the pursuit of the insurance recovery were expensed in the period incurred 
the insurance recoveries and related legal fees and expenses for fiscal years   and are included in insurance recovery legal expenses  net within the consolidated statements of income 
legal expenses from the inception of this litigation through the end of fiscal year totaled approximately million 
on a net basis  we have recovered approximately million of the million paid to the customer additional information regarding the legal settlements is provided in note to the financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and discuss with our audit committee our estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory reserves  asset impairments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting policies and estimates do not vary between our two reportable segments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  bank and corporate obligations 
temporary investments mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
we classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity 
we include any unrealized gain or loss  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  where return privileges exist until these products are sold through to end users or the return privilege lapses 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  are recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against our inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and estimable 
any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
stock based compensation in fiscal years through  we included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements a pro forma disclosure of the impact stock options would have on net income loss using the fair value stock option expense recognition method  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
a revised standard  sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value  is effective beginning with a company s first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or 
table of contents after june  this means sfas r is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year  which began on january  the adoption of sfas r requires us to apply a valuation model  which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas r 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
the company accounts for other purchased intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
accounting for income taxes we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin in the first quarter of fiscal year as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting 
table of contents purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we change the valuation allowance in a period  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
if a valuation allowance relates to benefits from stock option exercise activity  any adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded to paid in capital in the period of the adjustment 
any release of a valuation allowance established against a pre acquisition xemics net operating loss carryforward will be recorded to goodwill 
management periodically evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant management estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
as a result of the adoption of fin in the first quarter of fiscal year  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
under sfas r  the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized for financial reporting purposes only if such awards are expected to result in a tax deduction 
sfas r prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset for an excess tax benefit that is  a tax benefit that exceeds the amount of compensation cost recognized for the award for financial reporting purposes that has not been realized 
in determining when an excess tax benefit is realized  we have elected to follow the ordering provision of the tax law 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year the semiconductor and electronics industry showed signs of improvement in the second half of fiscal year this strength continued throughout most of fiscal year exiting the year with only a modest slowing 
the year over year sales growth reflected improvements in the company s overall execution coupled with favorable market conditions

gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the prior year 
gross profit was positively impacted by a increase in net sales for the fiscal year our gross margin was for fiscal year  up from in fiscal year our margins were positively impacted by favorable product revenue mix for the year as well as higher absorption of fixed overhead manufacturing costs related to higher production volumes for fiscal year additionally  for fiscal year the company took a significant write down of obsolete and excessive inventory relating to the decline in our power management business year over year of nearly 
for fiscal year the write down for obsolete and excessive inventory was down significantly 
our strategy is to develop new products that offer more advanced and more complex features than the competition  which in turn generally provides for higher gross margin 
however  margin improvements may be offset by price erosion due to competition and other factors tied to industry conditions

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance or additional financial information

as of january   we had working capital of million  compared with million as of january  and million as of january  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities as of january  was to  compared to to as of january  and to as of january  the decrease in working capital as of january  compared to the prior year was primarily due to the million stock repurchase transactions in the fiscal year 
the increase in working capital as of january  compared to the prior year was primarily due to the sale and maturities of investments net of purchases amounting to million and reclassification of land held for sale from the long term portion of the balance sheet into current assets 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  primarily due to net income of million adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million 
this activity was offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and accrued liabilities of million

in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we have incurred significant expenditures during the past five years 
we intend to continue to focus on those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities  which may require additional investment in equipment and will require continued  and perhaps additional  investment in design and application engineers aimed at developing new products 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by our operations and our existing cash balances 

table of contents a meaningful portion of our capital resources  and the related liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held in switzerland  compared to million held in switzerland as of january  if we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations  any repatriation could have negative tax implications 
for all periods presented  the purchases of new capital equipment were made to expand our test capacity  support engineering functions  including product design and qualification and information technology equipment needed to run our business 
these purchases were funded from our operating cash flows and existing cash balances 
we believe that operating cash flows together with existing cash balances are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as those arrangements are defined by the sec  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries or affiliated entities

noted below under contractual obligations are various commitments we have associated with our business  such as lease commitments and open purchase obligations  that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet because we have not yet received the related goods or services as of january  contractual obligations presented below is a summary of our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total operating leases open capital purchase commitments other open purchase commitments other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations as of january   we had approximately million in operating lease commitments that extend over a seven year period 
the portion of these operating lease payments due during fiscal year fiscal is approximately million

compensation expense under this plan for fiscal years  and totaled approximately  net of  of forfeitures   net of  of forfeitures and  net of  of forfeitures  respectively

the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other assets 
in addition to the amounts reflected in the contractual obligations table above  the company has million of fin non current accrued taxes for uncertain tax positions 
the company expects that any tax increases from audits would be substantially offset by carryforward tax attributes ie  tax credits 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the amounts and timing of possible future cash outflows associated with these fin liabilities  and the likelihood that any tax liability would be substantially offset by utilizing carryforward tax attributes  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of possible cash settlement 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can impact on our market risk are external to the company  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience currency gains or losses 
historically  we have not considered our foreign currency exposure to be material  and therefore have not used forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risks 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and changes in the rates could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our bank accounts and current assets exist in non us dollar currencies 
the non us dollar currencies are principally the swiss franc  euro  mexican peso  and british pound sterling 
additionally  certain of our liabilities are denominated in swiss francs and british pounds sterling subjecting them to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may result in transaction gain or losses 
all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange rate fluctuations in foreign countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately million of expenses were settled in british pound sterling  million of expenses were settled in swiss francs  million of expenses were settled in euros and million of expenses were settled in mexican pesos 
had rates of these various foreign currencies strengthened by relative to the us dollar in fiscal year  our costs would have increased approximately  related to expenses settled in british pound sterling   related to expenses settled in swiss francs   related to expenses settled in euros and  related to expenses settled in mexican pesos 
as of the end of fiscal year  we held cash funds of  in british pound sterling   in swiss francs   in euros and  in mexican pesos 
if rates of these foreign currencies were to strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar  the company would realize gains or losses in converting these funds back into us dollars 
interest rate and market risk as of january   we had no long term debt outstanding 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
our investments are subject to market risks  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers following investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines include prescribing credit quality  permissible investments  diversification  and maturity restrictions 
these restrictions are intended to limit risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term duration 
for fiscal year  we implemented an investment strategy to invest new and maturing securities in federal agency issues lowering the overall credit risk of the portfolio
