table of contents energy  telecommunications and data communications products 
as a result of completing our integration of the data communications products into our australian facility those products are included in our australian segment beginning in prior periods have been restated accordingly 
our brazil and canada segments are comprised of the manufacturing and sales operations from those locations which meet at least one of the criteria of a reportable segment 
our final segment is south africa  which is comprised of a manufacturing and sales operation  and has been included as a segment to comply with reporting segments for of consolidated sales 
our remaining operations are included in all other as none of these operations meet the criteria for a reportable segment and individually represent less that for each of our combined net sales  consolidated net income  and consolidated assets 
market overview our business continues to be concentrated in the energy and communications markets 
during  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in all of our major markets 
this trend is expected to continue in we have a growing concern that a slowing economy coupled with an already depressed us housing market could further affect construction projects and negatively impact growth opportunities in our core markets going forward 
in  we experienced growth in our energy markets 
we continued to see the investment in new transmission grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure 
we expect the distribution energy market to slow in but anticipate continued growth in demand for transmission and fiber optic products 
our international business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our international sales were primarily to the distribution portion of the energy market 
we continued to increase our energy distribution sales while also experiencing significant sales growth in the energy transmission market 
in  we acquired approximately of belos sa belos  located in bielsko biala  poland  broadening our transmission product offering for the energy markets 
we expect that growth in the international energy markets will continue for the foreseeable future as new construction projects are added in developing markets and there is a need to rebuild and refurbish the international energy transmission and distribution infrastructure 
we believe that we are well positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies 
in our communications markets  telecommunication companies continued to curtail their investment in the construction and maintenance of copper networks while diverting some of these resources into fiber to the premise fttp projects 
we anticipate the investment in the copper network will continue to decline 
the large communications carriers are rationalizing their vendor base 
this results in downward pressure on prices 
in  we saw an improvement in the us investment spending on infrastructure by the telephone companies  the cable television catvs providers and by municipalities and we expect growth opportunities in these markets to continue assuming the economy stabilizes 
additionally  many of our new product offerings which are presently in the approval process and undergoing third party testing should provide an opportunity to enhance our product offerings to the large communication carriers 
in  we continued to develop our brand and product awareness internationally as part of a concentrated effort in fttp 
as a result  several international carriers are conducting field trials of our products to be used on future fttp projects

we have commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space  transportation equipment  office and computer equipment and capital leases primarily for equipment 
one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk to make up a deficiency from market value attributable to damage  extraordinary wear and tear  excess air hours or exceeding maintenance overhaul schedules required by the federal aviation administration 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value

we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our existing cash of million  together with our untapped borrowing capacity  provides substantial financial resources 
if we were to incur significant additional indebtedness  we expect to be able to meet liquidity needs under the credit facilities 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition

future expected amounts have not been disclosed as the company is unable to estimate the years in which benefit payments may occur

 accounting for income taxes fin 
for further discussion  see note a and note f to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as of december   there were million of tax liabilities  including interest  related to unrecognized tax benefits 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  if any  the company is unable to estimate the years in which cash settlement may occur with the respective tax authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents receivable allowances allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents approximately of our trade receivable at december  and of our trade receivable at december  reserve for credit memos we maintain an allowance for future sales credits related to sales recorded during the year 
our estimated allowance is based on historical sales credits issued in the subsequent year related to the prior year and any significant open return good authorizations as of the balance sheet date 
our allowance is updated on a quarterly basis 
the out of period credit reserve represents approximately of our trade receivables at december  and excess and obsolescence reserves we provide excess and obsolescence reserves to state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
we identify inventory items which have had no usage or are in excess of the usages over the historical to months 
a management team with representatives from marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance reviews these inventory items and determines the disposition of the inventory and assesses the estimated market value based on their knowledge of the product and market conditions 
these conditions include among other things  future demand for product  product utility  unique customer order patterns or unique raw material purchase patterns  changes in customer and quality issues 
at december  and the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was and of gross inventory 
if the impact of market conditions worsen from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
there were no trigger events during or and as such only an annual impairment test was performed 
during losses continued for our thailand operation which presented an indicator that the goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill for the thailand operation in the amount of 
million was impaired and written off as of january  
table of contents deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we established a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions we identify tax positions taken on the federal  state  local and foreign income tax returns filed or to be filed 
a tax position can include a reduction in taxable income reported in a previously filed tax return or expected to be reported on a future tax return that impacts the measurement of current or deferred income tax assets or liabilities in the period being reported  a decision not to file a tax return  an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions  the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return  or a decision to classify a transaction  entity or other position in a tax return as tax exempt 
we determine whether a tax position is an uncertain or a routine business transaction tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained at the full amount upon examination 
under fin  tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce our current or future income tax liability  are reported in our financial statements only to the extent that each benefit was recognized and measured under a two step approach 
the first step requires us to assess whether each tax position based on its technical merits and facts and circumstances as of the reporting date  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step measures the amount of tax benefit that we recognize in the financial statements  based on a cumulative probability approach 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold that is not highly certain is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority  assuming that the tax authority has examined the position and has full knowledge of all relevant information 
fin requires subjectivity of judgments to identify outcomes and to assign probability in order to estimate the settlement amount 
we provide estimates in order to determine settlement amounts 
during the year ended december   we recognized a provision of less than 
million of uncertain tax positions and interest  which was net of a 
million benefit for the amounts that lapsed through expiring statutes 
at december   total reserves for uncertain tax positions and related interest are million 
business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets less liabilities as goodwill 
when the amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the cost of the acquired business  we recognize an additional cost element for the acquired business related to any contingent consideration and recognize a liability for the lesser of the maximum amount of the contingent consideration or the excess 
when the amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the cost of the acquired business including any related contingent consideration  we allocate the excess as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to the acquired property and equipment and other intangible assets of the acquired business 
generally we use third party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and identifiable intangibles and consult with actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations under retirement plans assumed and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims  if any 

table of contents pensions we record plan assets  obligations and expenses related to pension benefit plans based on actuarial valuations  which include key assumptions on discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and compensation increases 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the discount rate of at december  reflects an analysis of yield curves as of the end of the year and the schedule of expected cash needs of the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets of reflects the plan s historical returns and represents our best estimate of the likely future returns on the plan s asset mix 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience  market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries 
however  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost  while a decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  an increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease the net periodic pension cost  while a decrease in expected long term return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost
