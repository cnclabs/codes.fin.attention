supportive care kyrbax menadione  a novel preclinical product candidate for the prevention and treatment of skin rash associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors  or egfr inhibitors  in the treatment of certain cancers 
industry background and market opportunity cancer is a group of diseases characterized by either the uncontrolled growth of cells or the failure of cells to function normally 
cancer is caused by a series of mutations  or alterations  in genes that control cells ability to grow and divide 
these mutations cause cells to rapidly and continuously divide or lose their normal ability to die 
there are more than different varieties of cancer  which can be divided into six major categories 
carcinomas  the most common category  include breast  lung  colorectal and prostate cancer 
sarcomas begin in tissue that connects  supports or surrounds other tissues and organs 
lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system  a part of the body s immune system 
leukemias are cancers of blood cells  which originate in the bone marrow 
brain tumors are cancers that begin in the brain  and skin cancers  including melanomas  originate in the skin 
cancers are considered metastatic if they spread via the blood or lymphatic system to other parts of the body to form secondary tumors 
according to the american cancer society  nearly million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in in the united states alone 
cancer is the second leading cause of death  after heart disease  in the united states  and is expected to account for more than  deaths in major cancer treatments include surgery  radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
supportive care  such as blood cell growth factors  represents another major segment of the cancer treatment market 
there are many different drugs that are used to treat cancer  including cytotoxics or antineoplastics  hormones and biologics 
major categories include chemotherapy 
cytotoxic chemotherapy refers to anticancer drugs that destroy cancer cells by stopping them from multiplying 
healthy cells can also be harmed with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy  especially those that divide quickly 
cytotoxic agents act primarily on macromolecular synthesis  repair or activity  which affects the production or function of dna  rna or proteins 
our product candidates marqibo hematological malignancies and solid tumors  alocrest solid tumors and brakiva solid tumors are liposome encapsulated cytotoxic agents that we are currently evaluating for the treatment of solid tumor and hematological malignancies 
supportive care 
cancer treatment can include the use of chemotherapy  radiation therapy  biologic response modifiers  surgery or some combination of these or other therapeutic options 
all of these treatment options are directed at killing or eradicating the cancer that exists in the patient s body 
unfortunately  the delivery of many cancer therapies adversely affects the body s normal organs 
these complications of treatment or side effects not only cause discomfort  but may also prevent the optimal delivery of therapy to a patient at its optimal dose and time 
our product candidate kyrbax is our supportive care product candidate designed to treat and prevent skin rash associated with the use of egfr inhibitors  a type of anti cancer agent 
our strategy we are committed to creating value by building a strong  experienced team  accelerating the development of our lead product candidates  including entering into strategic partnership agreements  expanding our pipeline by being the alliance partner of choice for academic and research organizations  and nurturing a science based company culture 
key aspects of our strategy include focus on developing innovative cancer therapies 
we focus on oncology product candidates in order to capture efficiencies and economies of scale 
we believe that drug development for cancer markets is particularly attractive because relatively small clinical trials can provide meaningful information regarding patient response and safety 
furthermore  we believe that our capabilities are well suited to the oncology market and represent distinct competitive advantages 
build a sustainable pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and disciplined decision criteria based on clearly defined proof of principle goals 
we seek to build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and by acquiring product candidates belonging to known drug classes 
in addition  we employ disciplined decision criteria to assess product candidates 
by pursuing this strategy  we seek to minimize our clinical development risk and accelerate the potential commercialization of current and future product candidates 
for a majority of our product candidates  we intend to pursue regulatory approval in multiple indications 
our cancer therapeutic product pipeline background of optisomal targeted drug delivery optisomal encapsulation is a novel method of liposomal drug delivery  which is designed to significantly increase tumor targeting and duration of exposure for cell cycle specific anticancer agents 
optisomal drug delivery consists of using a generic fda approved cancer agent  such as vincristine  encapsulated in a lipid envelope composed of a unique  sphingomyelin cholesterol composition 
the encapsulated agent is carried through the bloodstream and delivered to disease sites where it is released to carry out its therapeutic action 
when used in unencapsulated form  chemotherapeutic drugs diffuse indiscriminately throughout the body  diluting drug effectiveness and causing toxic side effects in the patient s healthy tissues 
our proprietary optisomal formulation technology is designed to permit loading higher concentrations of therapeutic agent inside the lipid envelope  which promotes accumulation of the drug in tumors and prolongs the drug s release at disease sites 
non clinical studies have demonstrated the optisomal formulation technology s ability to deliver dose intensification to the tumor  which we believe has the potential to increase the therapeutic benefit of the drug 
longer circulation time in the bloodstream is designed to deliver more of the therapeutic agent to targeted tumor sites over a longer period of time 
the advanced liposomal technology of the capsule which protects the active drug increases the circulating half life and is designed to extend the duration of drug release 
optisomal drugs like marqibo exit the circulation via the pores of leaky vessels such as those created during tumor neovascularization proliferation of blood vessels in tissue not normally containing them 
in normal tissues  a continuous endothelial blood vessel lining constrains liposomes within capillaries  preventing accumulation of the drug in the healthy tissues 
in contrast  the immature blood vessel system within tumors is created during tumor growth and has numerous gaps up to nanometers in size 
with an average diameter of approximately nanometers  optisomes can pass through these gaps 
once lodged within the tumor interstitial space  these optisomes slowly release the encapsulated drug 
we believe that slow release of the drug from optisomes increases drug levels within the tumor  extends drug exposure through multiple cell cycles  and significantly increases tumor cell killing 
a limited fraction of a pati ent s tumor cells are in a particular drug sensitive phase at any point in time  which we believe indicates that duration of drug exposure is critical to increased drug efficacy 
increased drug concentration at the tumor site is associated with increased efficacy 
the link between drug exposure and anti tumor efficacy is especially pronounced for cell cycle specific agents such as vincristine  vinorelbine and topotecan  which destroy tumor cells by interfering in one specific phase in cell division eg  the mitosis  synthesis and or rapid growth phases 
marqibo vincristine sulfate liposomes injection unmet medical needs in all and uveal melanoma all is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow  the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made 
acute leukemias progress rapidly and involve the accumulation of immature blood cells 
all affects a group of white blood cells  called lymphocytes  which fight infection and constitute our immune systems 
normally  bone marrow produces immature cells or stem cells  in a controlled way  and they mature and specialize into the various types of blood cells  as needed 
in people with all  this production process breaks down 
large numbers of immature  abnormal lymphocytes called lymphoblasts are produced and released into the bloodstream 
these abnormal cells are not able to mature and perform their usual functions 
furthermore  they multiply rapidly and can crowd out healthy blood cells  leaving an adult or child with all vulnerable to infection or bleeding 
leukemic cells can also collect in certain areas of the body  including the central nervous system and spinal cord  which can cause serious problems 
according to the american cancer society  over  people in the united states are expected to be diagnosed with all in multiple clinical trials have suggested the overall survival rate for adults diagnosed with all is approximately to  underscoring the need for new therapeutic options 
uveal melanoma is a relatively rare cancer arising out of the colored part of the eye and the surrounding areas  called the uvea 
uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults and represents of all melanoma diagnoses 
the incidence of uveal melanoma in the u 
s is reported 
to be  per year 
the disease metastasizes via the blood stream  and approximately and up to of patients with primary uveal melanoma will ultimately develop distant metastases 
at the time of diagnosis  over of patients have disease limited to the eye  but at least of these patients will die of systemic metastases at years and at years 
the liver is involved in up to of individuals who develop metastatic disease 
lung tissue and bone are the other major sites of disease spread 
in general  metastatic uveal melanoma is unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy and immunothera py 
product description marqibo is a novel  targeted optisomal formulation product candidate comprised of the fda approved anticancer drug vincristine 
this encapsulation is designed to provide prolonged circulation of the drug in the blood and accumulation at the tumor site 
these characteristics are intended to increase the effectiveness and reduce the side effects of the encapsulated drug 
vincristine  a microtubule inhibitor  is fda approved for all and is widely used as a single agent and in combination regimens for treatment for hematologic malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias 
clinical development program we acquired our rights to marqibo from tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation formerly inex pharmaceuticals corporation in may marqibo has been evaluated in clinical trials with over patients  including phase clinical trials in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl and all 
based on the results from these studies  we are conducting a multi center  multi national  single arm  open label  registration enabling phase clinical trial 
the study patient population is adults with philadelphia chromosome negative all 
the primary outcome measure is confirmed complete remission  or cr  or complete remission without full platelet recovery or crp 
the sample size is evaluable subjects 
we also plan to conduct a confirmatory  phase front line trial 
the study population is elderly subjects at least years of age with newly diagnosed philadelphia chromosome negative all or lymphoblastic lymphoma 
subjects will be given a multi agent treatment regimen including either marqibo mg m no dose cap or vincristine mg m mg cap 
the primary outcome measure is event free survival with death  failure to achieve cr crp  and relapse after cr crp as events 
tekmira previously sponsored multiple marqibo clinical trials  one in particular provided the basis for our clinical development plan 
the first was a phase dose escalation clinical trial arriving at a maximum tolerated dose of mg m combined with a fixed dose of oral dexamethasone in relapsed and or refractory all 
thirty six patients were treated in the phase portion of this clinical trial with dosing ranging from to mg m weekly 
of evaluable patients achieved cr and achieved cr on an intent to treat basis and with a toxicity profile that was consistent with vincristine at the normal dose 
marqibo received a us fda orphan drug designation in january and a fast track designation in august for the treatment of adult all 
we are also conducting a pilot  phase study to assess the efficacy of single agent marqibo as determined by response rates in patients with metastatic malignant uveal melanoma 
the patient population is defined as adults with uveal melanoma and confirmed metastatic disease that is untreated or that has progressed following one prior therapy 
we expect to enroll up to subjects in this clinical trial 
the phase clinical trial is supported by data from phase trials of marqibo in patients with metastatic melanoma demonstrating promising single agent activity 
this trial was conducted at the university of texas md anderson cancer center 
in the phase study  an objective response rate complete response plus partial response of and a stable disease rate of were achieved among patients with histologically confirmed  inoperable metastatic cutaneous skin cancer  mucosal mucus membrane  or uveal melanoma 
one of four subjects with uveal melanoma metastatic to the lung achieved a complete response and has remained disease free for over months off of therapy 
marqibo was generally well tolerated and showed promising single agent activity against metastatic melanoma 
alocrest vinorelbine liposomes injection alocrest is a novel optisomal encapsulated formulation product candidate of the fda approved drug vinorelbine  a microtubule inhibitor for use as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin for the first line treatment of unresectable  advanced non small cell lung cancer 
in february  we completed enrollment in a phase study of alocrest 
the trial enrolled adult subjects with confirmed solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy was known to exist  or with relapsed and or refractory nhl 
the objectives of the phase clinical trial were to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with alocrest  to determine the maximum tolerated dose of alocrest  to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of alocrest  and to explore preliminary efficacy of alocrest 
the open label  single arm  non randomized  multi center  dose escalation study was conducted at the cancer therapy and research center and south texas accelerated re search therapeutics start  both in san antonio  texas  and at mcgill university in montreal 
patients received alocrest via a minute iv infusion on days and every days at various dose levels 
reversible neutropenia  a low white blood cell count  was the most common dose limiting toxicity 
anti cancer activity and acceptable and predictable toxicity was demonstrated and a disease control rate was achieved across a broad range of doses 
brakiva topotecan liposomes injection brakiva is our proprietary product candidate comprised of the anti cancer drug topotecan encapsulated in optisomes 
topotecan is fda approved for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of initial or subsequent chemotherapy  and small cell lung cancer sensitive disease after failure of first line chemotherapy 
we currently have an open and activated ind i n the us and plan to initiate a phase dose escalation clinical trial in the second half of our supportive care product kyrbax menadione kyrbax  which we licensed from the albert einstein college of medicine aecom in october  is a novel  preclinical product candidate under development for the treatment and or prevention of skin rash associated with the use of egfr inhibitors in the treatment of certain cancers 
egfr inhibitors are currently used to treat non small cell lung cancer  pancreatic  colorectal  and head and neck cancer 
egfr inhibitors are associated with significant skin toxicities presenting as acne like rash on the face  neck and upper torso of the body 
kyrbax  a small organic molecule  has been shown to activate the egfr signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphatase activity which is an important enzyme in the egfr pathway 
in vivo studies have suggested that topically applied kyrbax may restore egfr signaling specifically in the skin of patients treated systemically with egfr inhibitors 
currently  there are no fda approved products or therapies available to treat these skin toxicities 
we currently have an open and activated ind in the us and canada and plan to initiate a phase clinical trial in the first half of we currently have an open and activated ind in the us and canada and plan to initiate a phase clinical trial in the first half of license agreements marqibo  alocrest and brakiva in may  we completed a transaction with tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation  formerly inex pharmaceuticals corporation  pursuant to which we acquired exclusive  worldwide rights to develop and commercialize three product candidates marqibo  alocrest and brakiva  collectively called the licensed products

kyrbax in october  we entered into a license agreement with the albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university  a division of yeshiva university  or the college 
pursuant to the agreement  we acquired an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to certain patent applications  and other intellectual property relating to topical menadione 
in consideration for the license  we agreed to issue the college million of our common stock  valued at per share representing the closing sale price on october  
we also agreed to make an additional cash payment within days of signing the agreement  and pay annual maintenance fees 
further  we agreed to make milestone payments in the aggregate amount of million upon the achievement of various clinical and regulatory milestones  as described in the agreement 
we may also make annual maintenance fees as part of the agreement 
we also agreed to make royalty payments to th e college on net sales of any products covered by a claim in any licensed patent 
we may also grant sublicenses to the licensed patents and the proceeds resulting from such sublicenses will be shared with the college 
zensana ondansetron hci oral spray our rights to zensana are subject to the terms of an october license agreement with novadel pharma  inc the license agreement grants us a royalty bearing  exclusive right and license to develop and commercialize zensana within the united states and canada 
the technology licensed to us under the license agreement currently covers one united states issued patent  which expires in march in consideration for the license  we issued  shares of our common stock to novadel and have agreed to make double digit royalty payments to novadel based on a percentage of net sales as defined in the agreement 
in addition  we purchased from novadel  shares of its common stock at a price of per share for an aggregate payment of million 
on july   we entered into a sublicense agreement with par pharmaceutical  inc and novadel  pursuant to which we granted to par and its affiliates  and novadel consented to such grant  a royalty bearing exclusive right and license to develop and commercialize zensana within the united states and canada 
we previously had acquired such exclusive  sublicensable rights from novadel and commenced development of zensana  a pharmaceutical product that contains ondansetron  pursuant to a license agreement with novadel dated october   as amended 
as agreed by us and novadel  par assumed primary responsibility for the development  regulatory approval by the fda  and sales and marketing of zensana 
in consideration for the license grant to par  and upon execution of the sublicense agreement  par purchased  newly issued shares of our common stock at a price per share of per share for aggregate consideration of million 
as additional consideration for the sublicense  following regulatory approval of zensana  the sublicense agreement  par is required to pay us an additional one time payment of million  of which million is payable by us to novadel pursuant to our obligations under our agreement with novadel 
in addition  the sublicense agreement provides for an additional aggregate of million in commercialization milestone payments based upon actual net sales of zensana in the united states and canada  which amounts are not subject to any corresponding obligations to novadel 
we will also be entitled to royalty payments based on net sales of zensana by par or any of its affiliates in such territory  however  the amount of such royalty payments is generally equal to the same amount of royalties that we will owe novadel under the license agreement  except to the extent that aggregate net sales of zensana exceed a specified amount in the first years following fda approval of an n da  in which case the royalty rate payable to us increases beyond its royalty obligation to novadel 
in order to give effect to and accommodate the terms of the sublicense agreement  on july   we also entered into an amended and restated license agreement with novadel 
the primary modifications to the amended and restated license agreement are as follows we relinquished our right under the original license agreement to reduced royalty rates to novadel until such time as we have recovered one half of our costs and expenses incurred in developing zensana from sales of zensana or payments or other fees from a sublicensee  novadel surrendered for cancellation all  shares of our common stock that it acquired upon the execution of the original license agreement  we will have the right  but not the obligation  to exploit the licensed product in canada  we or our sublicensee must consummate the first commercial sale of the licensed product within months of regulatory approval by the fda of such product  and if the sublicense agreement is terminated  we may elect to undertake further development of zensana 
talvesta talotrexin for injection in november  we provided notice of termination of the license agreement dated december   pursuant to which the dana farber cancer institute  inc and ash steven  inc 
granted to us an exclusive license to patents relating to the drug candidate talvesta 
our termination of the license agreement was based on its decision to discontinue the development of talvesta as a result of the significant expense required in order for us to resume the clinical evaluation of this product candidate 
intellectual property general patents and other proprietary rights are very important to the development of our business 
we will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
it is our intention to seek and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates and our proprietary technologies 
as part of our business strategy  our policy is to actively file patent applications in the united states and internationally to cover methods of use  new chemical compounds  pharmaceutical compositions and dosing of the compounds and compositions and improvements in each of these 
we also rely on trade secret information  technical know how  innovation and agreements with third parties to continuously expand and protect our competitive position 
we own  or license the rights to  a number of patents and patent applications related to our product candidates  but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that the pending patent applications will issue as patents 
the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents  or their enforceability 
to date  there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications  if issued 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possib le that before we commercialize any of our product candidates  any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization  thus reducing any advantage of the patent 
if patents are issued to others containing preclusive or conflicting claims and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business 
we also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
litigation would create substantial costs 
an adverse outcome in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology if such licenses are unavailable 
optisomal product candidates pursuant to our license agreement with tekmira and related sublicense with ubc  we have exclusive rights to issued us patents and allowed us patent application  issued foreign patents  pending us patent applications and pending foreign applications  covering composition of matter  method of use and treatment  formulation and process 
these patents and patent applications cover sphingosome based pharmaceutical compositions including marqibo  alocrest and brakiva  formulation  dosage  process of making the liposome compositions  and methods of use of the compositions in the treatment cancer  relapsed cancer  and solid tumors 
the earliest of these issued patents expires in and the last of the issued patents expires in if the allowed us patent application issues  it will expire in kyrbax we have exclusive  worldwide rights to a pct application pursuant to our october license agreement with aecom 
this application covers both compositions of matter eg  pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use eg  methods of treating and preventing a skin rash secondary to an anti epidermal growth factor receptor therapy 
if any us or foreign patent claiming priority to the pct application issues  then such a patent would be scheduled to expire in zensana our license with novadel pharma relating to zensana covers two issued us patents covering compositions of matter and methods of use  both of which expire in  and six related pending us patent applications 
if issued  all of the pending patent applications would expire in and cover methods of use  and three applications would additionally cover compositions of matter 
the current clinical candidate formulation is covered by one issued us patent covering compositions of matter  and if issued  four pending applications covering methods of use  two of which also cover compositions of matter 
on july   we entered into a definitive agreement providing for the sublicense of all our rights to any patents related to zensana to par pharmaceutical  inc see license agreements zensana 
other intellectual property rights we also depend upon trademarks  trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we require our employees  scientific advisors  consultants and collaborators  upon commencement of a relationship with us  to execute confidentiality agreements and  in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators  to agree to assign their inventions to us 
these agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us 
these agreements may not  however  provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
in addition to patent protection  we may utilize orphan drug regulations to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates 
the orphan drug regulations of the fda provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases  currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than  individuals in the united states  or  diseases that affect more than  individuals in the united states but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for such fda approved orphan product 
we believe that certain of the indications for our product candidates will be eligible for orphan drug designation  however  we cannot assure you that our drugs will obt ain such orphan drug designation or will be the first to reach the market and provide us with such market exclusivity protection 
government regulation and product approval the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the testing preclinical and clinical  manufacturing  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  advertising  promotion  import  export  marketing and distribution  among other things  of drugs and drug product candidates 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  we may be fined  the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products  and we may be criminally prosecuted 
we and our manufacturers may also be subject to regulations under other united states federal  state  and local laws 
united states government regulation in the united states  the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and implementing regulations 
the process required by the fda before our product candidates may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following although the fda is given wide discretion to impose different or more stringent requirements on a case by case basis completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical animal studies and formulation studies  all performed in accordance with the fda s good laboratory practice regulations and other regulations  submission to the fda of an ind application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of multiple adequate and well controlled clinical trials meeting fda requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication  submission of an nda to the fda  satisfactory completion of an fda pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced  and potentially other involved facilities as well  to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  regulations and other applicable regulations  and the fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
risks to us related to these regulations are described under item a of this annual report under the subheading risks related to the clinical testing  regulatory approval and manufacturing of our product candidates 
preclinical tests may include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as studies to evaluate toxicity and other effects in animals 
the results of preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  among other information  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application 
subject to certain exceptions  an ind becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within the day time period  issues a clinical hold to delay a proposed clinical investigation due to concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial  including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
our submission of an ind  or those of our collaboration partners  may not result in the fda authorization to commence a clinical trial 
a separate submission to an existing ind must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development 
the fda must also approve changes to an existing ind 
further  an independent institutional review board  or irb  for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed 
the fda  the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice requirements and regulations for informed consent 
clinical trials for purposes of nda submission and approval  clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases  which may overlap although additional or different trials may be required by the fda as well phase clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety  dose tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion in healthy humans or  on occasion  in patients  such as cancer patients 
in some cases  particularly in cancer trials  a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a phase b evaluation  which is a second safety focused phase clinical trial typically designed to evaluate the impact of the drug candidate in combination with currently fda approved drugs 
phase clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage 
multiple phase clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase clinical trials 
in some cases  a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a phase b evaluation  which is a second  confirmatory phase clinical trial that could  if positive and accepted by the fda  serve as a pivotal clinical trial in the approval of a drug candidate 
phase clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials 
when phase clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage  to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple  geographically dispersed clinical trial sites 
in some cases  the fda may condition continued approval of an nda on the sponsor s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials with due diligence 
in other cases  the sponsor and the fda may agree that additional safety and or efficacy data should be provided  however  continued approval of the nda may not always depend on timely submission of such information 
such post approval studies are typically referred to as phase iv studies 
new drug application the results of drug candidate development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  together with  among other things  detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling  and the payment of a user fee  are submitted to the fda as part of an nda 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
once an nda is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the application 
during its review of an nda  the fda may refer the application to an advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda may refuse to approve an nda and issue a not approvable letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or it may require additional clinical or other data  including one or more additional pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
even if such data are submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we or our collaboration partners interpret data 
if the fda s evaluations of the nda and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter  which contains the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
if and when those c onditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
the fda may withdraw drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market 
in addition  the fda may require testing  including phase iv clinical trials  and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post marketing programs 
drugs may be marketed only for the fda approved indications and in accordance with the fda approved label 
further  if there are any modifications to the drug  including changes in indications  other labeling changes  or manufacturing processes or facilities  we may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new nda or nda supplement  which may require us to develop additional data or condu ct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
section b new drug applications as an alternate path to fda approval of  for example  new indications or improved formulations of previously approved products  under certain circumstances a company may submit a section b nda  instead of a stand alone or full b nda 
section b of the fdca was enacted as part of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  otherwise known as the hatch waxman act 
section b permits the submission of an nda where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
for example  the hatch waxman act permits an applicant to rely upon the fda s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product 
the fda may also require companies to perform one or more additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product 
the fda may then approve th e new formulation for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved  or a new indication sought by the section b applicant 
to the extent that the section b applicant is relying on the fda s findings for an already approved product  the applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the fda s orange book publication 
specifically  the applicant must certify that the required patent information has not been filed paragraph i certification  the listed patent has expired paragraph ii certification  the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration paragraph iii certification  or the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  use or sale of the new product paragraph iv certification 
if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents  the section b application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired  and once any pediatric exc lusivity expires 
the section b application may also not be approved until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired 
if the applicant has provided a paragraph iv certification to the fda  the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph iv certification to the nda holder and patent owner once the nda has been accepted for filing by the fda 
the nda holder and patent owner may then initiate a legal challenge to the paragraph iv certification 
the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within days of their receipt of a paragraph iv certification automatically prevents the fda from approving the section b nda until the earliest of months  expiration of the patent  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in an infringement case that is favorable to the section b applicant 
thus  a section b applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized 
alternativel y  if the nda holder or patent owner does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required day period  the applicant s nda will not be subject to the month stay 
notwithstanding the approval of many products by the fda pursuant to section b  over the last few years  certain brand name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the fda s interpretation of section b 
if the fda changes its interpretation of section b  this could delay or even prevent the fda from approving any section b nda that we or par pharmaceutical  to whom we sublicensed our rights to zensana  may submit 
the hatch waxman act under the hatch waxman act  newly approved drugs and new conditions of use may benefit from a statutory period of non patent marketing exclusivity 
the hatch waxman act provides five year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an nda for a new chemical entity  meaning that the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active entity 
the hatch waxman act prohibits the submission of an abbreviated nda  or anda  or a section b nda for another version of such drug during the five year exclusive period  however  submission of a section b nda or an anda for a generic version of a previously approved drug containing a paragraph iv certification is permitted after four years  which may trigger a month stay of approval of the anda or section b nda 
protection under the hatch waxman act does not prevent the submission or approval of another full b nda  however  the applicant w ould be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness 
the hatch waxman act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental ndas  including section b ndas  for  among other things  new indications  dosages  or strengths of an existing drug  if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the application 
some of our product candidates may qualify for hatch waxman non patent marketing exclusivity 
in addition to non patent marketing exclusivity  the hatch waxman act amended the fdca to require each nda sponsor to submit with its application information on any patent that claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the nda or that claims a method of using such drug and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture  use  or sale of the drug 
generic applicants that wish to rely on the approval of a drug listed in the orange book must certify to each listed patent  as discussed above 
we intend to submit for orange book listing all relevant patents for our product candidates 
finally  the hatch waxman act amended the patent laws so that certain patents related to products regulated by the fda are eligible for a patent term extension if patent life was lost during a period when the product was undergoing regulatory review  and if certain criteria are met 
we intend to seek patent term extensions  provided our patents and products  if they are approved  meet applicable eligibility requirements 
pediatric studies and exclusivity the fdca provides an additional six months of non patent marketing exclusivity and patent protection for any such protections listed in the orange book for new or marketed drugs if a sponsor conducts specific pediatric studies at the written request of the fda 
the pediatric research equity act of  or prea  authorizes the fda to require pediatric studies for drugs to ensure the drugs safety and efficacy in children 
prea requires that certain new ndas or nda supplements contain data assessing the safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric subpopulations 
dosing and administration must be supported for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective 
the fda may also require this data for approved drugs that are used in pediatric patients for the labeled indication  or where there may be therapeutic benefits over existing products 
the fda may grant deferrals for submission of data  or full or partial waivers from prea 
prea pediatric assessments may qualify for pediatric exclusivity 
unless otherwise required by regulation  prea does not apply to any drug for an indication with orphan designation 
we may also seek pediatric exclusivity for conducting any required pediatric assessments 
orphan drug designation and exclusivity the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda 
if the fda grants orphan drug designation  which it may not  the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the fda 
orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity  meaning that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical sup eriority to the product with orphan exclusivity superior efficacy  safety  or a major contribution to patient care 
orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for that indication 
we received orphan drug status for marqibo in january  for the treatment of all 
under european union medicines laws  the criteria for designating a product as an orphan medicine are similar but somewhat different from those in the united states 
a drug is designated as an orphan drug if the sponsor can establish that the drug is intended for a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in  persons in the european union or that is unlikely to be profitable  and if there is no approved satisfactory treatment or if the drug would be a significant benefit to those persons with the condition 
orphan medicines are entitled to ten years of marketing exclusivity  except under certain limited circumstances comparable to united states law 
during this period of marketing exclusivity  no similar product  whether or not supported by full safety and efficacy data  will be approved unless a second applicant can establish that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise cli nically superior 
this period may be reduced to six years if the conditions that originally justified orphan designation change or the sponsor makes excessive profits 
fast track designation the fda s fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and to expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
under the fast track program  applicants may seek traditional approval for a product based on data demonstrating an effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint  or approval based on a well established surrogate endpoint 
the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the fda to designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug at the time of original submission of its ind  or at any time thereafter prior to receiving marketing approval of a marketing application 
the fda will determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within days of receipt of the sponsor s request 
if the fda grants fast track designation  it may initiate review of sections of an nda before the application is complete 
this so called rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the fda approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant has paid applicable user fees 
the fda s pdufa review clock for both a standard and priority nda for a fast track product does not begin until the complete application is submitted 
additionally  fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by emerging data  or if the designated drug development program is no longer being pursued 
in some cases  a fast track designated drug candidate may also qualify for one or more of the following programs priority review 
as explained above  a drug candidate may be eligible for a six month priority review 
the fda assigns priority review status to an application if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of a disease 
a fast track drug would ordinarily meet the fda s criteria for priority review  but may also be assigned a standard review 
we do not know whether any of our drug candidates will be assigned priority review status or  if priority review status is assigned  whether that review or approval will be faster than conventional fda procedures  or that the fda will ultimately approve the drug 
accelerated approval 
under the fda s accelerated approval regulations  the fda is authorized to approve drug candidates that have been studied for their safety and efficacy in treating serious or life threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than patient survival or irreversible morbidity 
in clinical trials  surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms 
a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post marketing compliance requirements  including the completion of phase iv or post approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the cli nical endpoint 
failure to conduct required post approval studies with due diligence  or to validate a surrogate endpoint or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies  may cause the fda to seek to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis 
all promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the fda 
when appropriate  we and our collaboration partners intend to seek fast track designation  accelerated approval or priority review for our product candidates 
we cannot predict whether any of our product candidates will obtain fast track  accelerated approval  or priority review designation  or the ultimate impact  if any  of these expedited review mechanisms on the timing or likelihood of the fda approval of any of our product candidates 
satisfaction of the fda regulations and approval requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years  and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or disease 
typically  if a drug candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease  as is the case with some of the product candidates we are developing  safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities 
the fda or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for changes in dosage form or new indications for our product candidates on a timely basis  or at all 
even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval  the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states  patient populations and dosages 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market 
delays in obtaining  or failures to obtain  regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates would harm our business 
in addition  we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future united states or foreign governmental action 
other regulatory requirements any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaboration partners pursuant to future fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug 
drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements  including cgmp  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as warning letters  suspension of manufacturing  sales or use  seizure of product  injunctive action or possible civil penalties 
we cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufactur ers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cgmp regulations and other ongoing fda regulatory requirements 
if our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements  the fda may halt our clinical trials  require us to recall a drug from distribution  or withdraw approval of the nda for that drug 
the fda closely regulates the post approval marketing and promotion of drugs  including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet 
a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the fda 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity  warning and or untitled letters  corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
in addition to regulations in europe and the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future products 
manufacturing we currently rely on a number of third parties  including contract manufacturing organizations and our collaborative partners  to produce our compounds 
marqibo requires three separate ingredients  sphingomyelin cholesterol liposomes for injection scli  vincristine sulfate injection vsi  and sodium phosphate for injection spi  all of which are handled by separate suppliers 
scli is manufactured by cangene corporation  vsi is manufactured by hospira and spi is manufactured by hollister steir laboratories 
alocrest and brakiva are both manufactured by gilead 
for kyrbax  we have contracted with dow pharmaceuticals and menadiona  a spain based company  for its manufacturing 
reimbursement in many of the markets where we intend to commercialize a product following regulatory approval  the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms 
in the united states  there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years 
although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the united states  federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public health care programs such as medicaid 
various states have adopted further mechanisms under medicaid and otherwise that seek to control drug prices  including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers 
managed care has also become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products 
federal legislation  enacted in december  has altered the way in which physician administered drugs covered by medicare are reimbursed 
under the new reimbursement methodology  physicians are reimbursed based on a prod uct s average sales price  or asp 
this new reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels 
the new federal legislation also has added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare  effective january in the interim  congress has established a discount drug card program for medicare beneficiaries 
both benefits will be provided primarily through private entities  which will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms  including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class 
payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered 
in particular  many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the fda or that are supported by other appropriate evidence for example  published medical literature and appear in a recognized drug compendium 
drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the ava ilable evidence  whether or not such uses have been approved by the fda 
for example  in the case of medicare coverage for physician administered oncology drugs  the omnibus budget reconciliation act of  with certain exceptions  prohibits medicare carriers from refusing to cover unapproved uses of an fda approved drug if the unapproved use is supported by one or more citations in the american hospital formulary service drug information  the american medical association drug evaluations  or the us pharmacopoeia drug information 
another commonly cited compendium  for example under medicaid  is the drugdex information system 
different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries 
for example  in the european union  governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers 
the approach taken varies from member state to member state 
some jurisdictions operate positive and or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed 
other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines  but monitor and control company profits 
the downward pressure on health care costs in general  particularly prescription drugs  has become very intense 
as a result  increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products  as exemplified by the national institute for clinical excellence in the uk  which evaluates the data supporting new medicine s and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government 
in addition  in some countries cross border imports from low priced markets parallel imports exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country 
competition we compete primarily in the segment of the biopharmaceutical market that addresses cancer and cancer supportive care  which is highly competitive 
we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and selling products designed to address cancer this market 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and drug development resources than we do 
large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs 
these companies also have significantly greater research capabilities than we do 
in addition  many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research 
we also compete with commercial biotechnology companies for the rights to product candidates developed by public and private research institutes 
smaller or early stage companies are a lso significant competitors  particularly those with collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things our ability to develop novel compounds with attractive pharmaceutical properties and to secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations  the efficacy  safety and reliability of our product candidates  the speed at which we develop our product candidates  our ability to design and successfully complete appropriate clinical trials  our ability to maintain a good relationship with regulatory authorities  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market or enter into strategic partnership agreements with others  and acceptance of future products by physicians and other healthcare providers 
employees as of march   we employed persons  all of whom are based at our south san francisco office 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors investment in our common stock involves significant risk 
you should carefully consider the information described in the following risk factors  together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this report  before making an investment decision regarding our common stock 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial conditions  results of operation and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock 
moreover  the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business  operating results  prospects or financial condition 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and may not be able to commercialize any products  generate significant revenues or attain profitability 
we have not generated significant revenue and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception 
we expect to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future  and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
for the years ended december  and december   we had net losses of million and million  respectively 
we expect our cash requirements to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical development and  if and when permitted by appropriate regulatory agencies  clinical trials for our current and any new product candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates at the appropriate time in the future  implement additional internal systems and infrastructure  seek to acquire additional technologies to develop  and hire additional personnel 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we succeed in developing and commercializing partnering one or more of our product candidates  which success is not assured  we may not be able to generate significant revenues 
even if we do generate significant revenues  we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
we need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed  we may have to discontinue our product development programs or relinquish our rights to some or all of our product candidates 
the manner in which we raise any additional funds may affect the value of your investment in our common stock 
we expect to incur losses at least until we can successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
we expect that we will require additional financing to fund our development programs and to expand our infrastructure and commercialization activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  together with our existing cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and lending commitments  we expect that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations into the second half of accordingly  we will need additional capital to fund our operations beyond such point 
if we fail to obtain the necessary financing  we will not be able to fund our operations 
we have no committed sources of additional capital 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us when needed  if at all 
if we fail to advance our current product candidates to later st age clinical trials  successfully commercialize marqibo or acquire new product candidates for development  we will have difficulty obtaining additional financing 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including costs associated with conducting preclinical and clinical testing  costs associated with commercializing our lead programs  including establishing sales and marketing functions  costs of establishing arrangements for manufacturing our product candidates  costs of acquiring new drug candidates  payments required under our current and any future license agreements and collaborations  costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  costs of obtaining  maintaining and defending patents on our product candidates  and costs of increased general and administrative expenses 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
we may grant future investors rights superior to those of our current stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  product candidates or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt  we could incur significant interest expense and become subject to covenants in the related transaction documentation that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business 
if we fail to acquire and develop other product candidates we may be unable to grow our business 
we intend to acquire rights to develop and commercialize additional product candidates 
because we currently neither have nor intend to establish internal research capabilities  we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and other researchers to sell or license us their product candidates 
the success of our strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical product candidates 
proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process 
we compete for partnering arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  many of which have significantly more experience than us and have significantly more financial resources than we do 
our competitors may have stronger relationships with certain third parties with whom we are interested in partnering  such as academic research institutions  and may  therefore  have a competitive advantage in entering into partnering arrangements with those third parties 
we may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
we expect that any product candidate to which we acquire rights will require significant additional development and other efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive clinical testing and approval by the fda and applicable foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe or effective for approval by regulatory authorities 
even if our product candidates are approved  they may not be manufactured or produced economically or commercialized successfully 
if we are unable to successfully manage our growth  our business may be harmed 
in the future  if we are able to advance our product candidates to the point of  and thereafter through  clinical trials  we will need to expand our development  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities 
any future growth will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
we are actively evaluating additional product candidates to acquire for development 
such additional product candidates  if any  could significantly increase our capital requirements and place further strain on the time of our existing personnel  which may delay or otherwise adversely affect the development of our existing product candidates 
we must manage our development efforts and cli nical trials effectively  and hire  train and integrate additional management  administrative and sales and marketing personnel 
we may not be able to accomplish these tasks  and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing hana 
if we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  our ability to grow our business may be harmed 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing  clinical research and testing  government regulation  formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are headquartered  is intense  and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful 
our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is critical to our success 
we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits 
the testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates  if approved 
even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources 
regardless of the merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  withdrawal of prior governmental approvals  costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients  product recalls  loss of revenue  and the inability to commercialize our product candidates 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop  alone or with collaborators 
we currently do not carry product liability insurance but instead maintain a million clinical trial insurance policy for our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates 
even if our agreements with any future collaborators entitle us to indemnification against damages from product liability claims  such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise 
risks related to the clinical testing  regulatory approval and manufacturing of our product candidates if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to sell our lead product candidate  marqibo  or any of our other product candidates  our business will suffer 
in may  we licensed marqibo from inex  which was succeeded by tekmira pharmaceuticals corp 
in april marqibo is not currently permitted to be commercially used 
inex submitted an nda pursuant to section b for accelerated marketing approval of marqibo primarily based upon a single arm  phase ii clinical trial  which was reviewed by the fda in and in january  the fda issued a not approvable letter to inex for the marqibo nda for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory nhl previously treated with at least two chemotherapy regimens 
the fda s not approvable letter cited a variety of reasons for not approving the nda  including the following the information presented by inex was inadequate and contained clinical deficiencies  the information presented by inex failed to provide evidence of an effect on a surrogate that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit  the information presented by inex contained chemistry  manufacturing and control deficiencies  a supportive study in nhl patients and all patients was not well conducted or well controlled  and the information presented by inex did not demonstrate an improvement over available therapy 
in rejecting the nda  the fda recommended that  if inex planned to pursue development of marqibo for the treatment of relapsed refractory nhl  inex should conduct additional studies  including but not limited to randomized controlled studies comparing marqibo to other chemotherapy regimens 
even if such studies are successfully performed  marqibo may not receive fda approval 
with respect to marqibo and any of our other product candidates  additional fda regulatory risks exist which may prevent fda approval of these drug candidates and thereby prevent their commercial use 
additionally  if marqibo or any of our product candidates are approved by the fda  such approval may be withdrawn by the fda for a variety of reasons  including that clinical or other experience  tests  or other scientific data show that the drug is unsafe for use  that new evidence of clinical experience or evidence from new tests  evaluated together with the evidence available to the fda when the nda was approved  shows that the drug is not shown to be safe for use under the approved conditions of use  that on the basis of new information presented to the fda  there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the approved conditions of use  that an nda contains any untrue statement of a material fact  or for a drug approved under fda s accelerated approval regulations or as a fast track drug  if any required post approval study is not conducted with due diligence or if such study fails to verify the clinical benefit of the drug 
other regulatory risks may arise as a result of a change in applicable law or regulation or the interpretation thereof  and may result in material modification or withdrawal of prior fda approvals 
many of our product candidates are in early stages of clinical trials  which are very expensive and time consuming 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our business 
other than marqibo  the other product candidates that we are developing  alocrest  brakiva  and kyrbax  are in early stages of development and will require extensive clinical and other testing and analysis before we will be in a position to consider seeking fda approval to sell such product candidates 
in addition to the risks set forth above for marqibo  which also apply to alocrest  brakiva and kyrbax  these product candidates also have additional risks as each is in an earlier stage of development and review 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and very expensive process and the results are inherently uncertain 
the duration of clinical trials can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete 
the completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or prevented by many factors  including delays in patient enrollment  and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  poor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials  safety issues  side effects  or other adverse events  results that do not demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates  governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements  policy and guidelines  and varying interpretation of data by the fda 
in conducting clinical trials  we may fail to establish the effectiveness of a compound for the targeted indication or discover that it is unsafe due to unforeseen side effects or other reasons 
even if our clinical trials are commenced and completed as planned  their results may not support our product candidate claims 
further  failure of product candidate development can occur at any stage of the clinical trials  or even thereafter  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials 
these problems could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials for our product candidates and could result in fda  or other regulatory authorities  delaying approval of our product candidates for any or all indications 
the results from preclinical testing and prior clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later or other larger clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  eve n in advanced clinical trials after showing promising results in earlier clinical trials 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates will prevent us from receiving regulatory approval to market these product candidates and will negatively impact our business 
in addition  we or the fda may suspend or curtail our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the fda finds deficiencies in the conduct of these clinical trials or in the composition  manufacture or administration of the product candidates 
accordingly  we cannot predict with any certainty when or if we will ever be in a position to submit an nda for any of our product candidates  or whether any such nda would ever be approved 
if we do not obtain the necessary us or foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates  we will not be able to market and sell our product candidates 
none of our product candidates have been approved for commercial sale in any country 
fda approval is required to commercialize all of our product candidates in the united states and approvals from the fda equivalent regulatory authorities are required in foreign jurisdictions in order to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions 
we possess world wide rights to develop and commercialize marqibo and our other product candidates 
in order to obtain fda approval of any of our product candidates  we must submit to the fda an nda  demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use and otherwise meets the requirements of existing laws and regulations governing new drugs 
this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests  which are referred to as preclinical studies  and human tests  which are referred to as clinical trials  as well as additional information and studies 
satisfaction of the fda s regulatory requirements typically takes many years  depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research  development and testing as well as for other purposes 
to date  none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the united states or in any foreign market 
we cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the fda c onsiders safe for humans and effective for indicated uses 
historically  only a small percentage of all drug candidates that start clinical trials are eventually approved by the fda for sale 
after clinical trials are completed  the fda has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post marketing studies 
the approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation  future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay or prevent commercialization of  and our ability to derive product revenues from  our product candidates  impose costly procedures on us  reduce the potential prices we may be able to charge for our product candidates  assuming they are approved for sale  and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy 
even if we comply with all fda requests  the fda may ultimately reject one or more of our ndas 
we cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
additionally  a change in applicable law or regulation  or the interpretation thereof  may result in material modification or withdrawal of prior fda approvals 
failure to obtain fda approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by reducing our number of saleable products and  therefore  corresponding product revenues 
if we do not complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate  we will not be able to recover any of the substantial costs invested by us in the development of the product candidate 
in foreign jurisdictions  we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs 
foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the fda approval procedures described above 
we cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates for sale outside the united states 
our competitive position may be harmed if a competitor obtains orphan drug designation and approval for the treatment of all for a clinically superior drug 
orphan drug designation is an important element of our competitive strategy because the latest of our licensors patents for marqibo expires in september in  the fda granted orphan drug designation for the use of marqibo in treating adult all 
the company that obtains the first fda approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease generally receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years 
however  even though we obtained orphan drug status for marqibo in the treatment of adult all  the fda may permit other companies to market a drug for the same designated and approved condition during our period of orphan drug exclusivity if it can be demonstrated that the drug is clinically superior to our drug 
this could create a more competitive market for us 
even if we obtain regulatory approvals for our products  the terms of approvals and ongoing monitoring and regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products  which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue 
even if regulatory approval is granted in the united states or in a foreign country  the approved product and its manufacturer  as well as others involved in the manufacturing and packaging process  remain subject to continual regulatory review and monitoring 
any regulatory approval that we receive for a product candidate may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed  or include requirements for potentially costly post approval clinical trials 
in addition  if the fda and or foreign regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates  the labeling  packaging  storage  advertising  promotion  recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post marketing information on the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements which may change over time 
we and the manufacturers of our products  their ingredients  and many aspects of the packaging are also required to comply with current good manufacturi ng practice regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
further  regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products or their ingredients or certain packagings  and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection 
discovery of problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions or sanctions with respect to the product  manufacturer and relevant manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda and other applicable foreign regulatory authorities  or if problems with our products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered  we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  including restrictions on the products  manufacturers or manufacturing process  warning letters or untitled letters  civil or criminal penalties or fines  injunctions  product seizures  detentions or import bans  voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  total or partial suspension of production and or sale  and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications 
in order to market any products outside of the united states  we must establish and comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another  but failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others 
because we are dependent on clinical research institutions and other contractors for clinical testing and for research and development activities  the results of our clinical trials and such research activities are  to a certain extent  beyond our control 
we depend upon independent investigators and collaborators  such as universities and medical institutions  to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us 
these parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
these investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves 
if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  the approval of our fda applications  if any  and our introduction of new drugs  if any  will be delayed 
these collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of whom may compete with us 
if our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense  our competitive position would be harmed 
our reliance on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates exposes us to a number of risks that may delay the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs 
we have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities 
we lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates 
we contract with one or more manufacturers to manufacture  supply  store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials 
if any of our product candidates receive fda approval  we will rely on one or more third party contractors to manufacture our drugs 
our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks we may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the fda must approve any replacement contractor 
this approval would require new testing and compliance inspections 
in addition  a new manufacturer would have to be educated in  or develop substantially equivalent processes for  production of our products after receipt of fda approval  if any 
our third party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and or commercial needs  if any 
our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce  store and distribute our products 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards  but we will be ultimately responsible for any of their failures 
if any third party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to the innovation 
this may prohibit us from seeking alternative or additional manufacturers for our products 
each of these risks could delay our clinical trials  the approval  if any  of our product candidates by the fda  or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues 
risks related to our ability to commercialize our product candidates our success depends substantially on marqibo  which is still under development and requires further regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to commercialize marqibo  or experience significant delays in doing so  our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be diminished 
in  we commenced a multi center  multi national phase regisration enabling clinical trial of marqibo in adult patients with relapsed all 
we also plan to conduct a supportive phase first line clinical trial in newly diagnosed  elderly adults with philadelphia chromosome negative all 
in addition  we are planning a single center pilot phase clinical trial of marqibo in patients with metastatic malignant uveal melanoma 
a significant portion of our time and financial resources for at least the next twelve months will be used in the development of our marqibo program 
we anticipate that our ability to generate revenues in the near term will depend solely on the successful development  regulatory approval and commercialization of marqibo 
all of our other product candidates are in the very early stages of development 
any of our product candidates could be unsuccessful if they do not demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy in preclinical studies or clinical trials or otherwise do not meet applicable regulatory standards for approval  do not offer therapeutic or other improvements over existing or future therapies used to treat the same conditions  are not capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs or pursuant to applicable rules and regulations  or are not accepted in the medical community and by third party payors 
if we are unable to commercialize our product candidates  we will not generate product revenues 
the results of our clinical trials to date do not provide assurance that acceptable efficacy or safety will be shown 
if we are unable either to create sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions  we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
to commercialize our product candidates  we must either develop internal sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  which will be expensive and time consuming  or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
if we decide to market any of our products directly  we must commit financial and managerial resources to develop marketing capabilities and a sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
other factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates  if approved  directly and without strategic partners include our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel  the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products  the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines  and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization 
if we are not able to partner with a third party and are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure  we will have difficulty commercializing our product candidates  which would harm our business 
if we rely on pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established distribution systems to market our products  we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements  and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other arrangements  any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties which may not be successful and which will be only partially in our control 
our product revenues would likely be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly 
the terms of our license agreements relating to intellectual property ownership rights may make it more difficult for us to establish collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of our license agreements obligate us to include intellectual property assignment provisions in any sublicenses or collaboration agreements that may be unacceptable to our potential sublicensees and partners 
these terms may impede our ability to enter into partnerships for some of our existing product candidates 
under our license agreement with tekmira  tekmira  either alone or jointly with md anderson cancer center  will be the owner of patents and patent applications claiming priority to certain patents licensed to us  and we not only have an obligation to assign to tekmira our rights to inventions covered by such patents or patent applications  but also  when negotiating any joint venture  collaborative research  development  commercialization or other agreement with a third party  to require such third party to do the same 
our license agreement with elan pharmaceuticals  inc  or elan  relating to marqibo  provides that elan will own all improvements to the licensed p atents or licensed know how made by us or any of our sublicensees 
potential collaboration and commercialization partners for these product candidates may not agree to such intellectual property ownership requirements and therefore not elect to partner with us for these product candidates 
if physicians and patients do not accept and use our product candidates  our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be materially impaired 
even if the fda approves any of our product candidates  if physicians and patients do not accept and use them  our business will be adversely affected 
acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs  pharmacological benefit and cost effectiveness of our products relative to competing products  availability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payors  effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors  if any  and the price at which we sell our products 
adequate coverage and reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates  which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend in significant part on the levels at which government payors and other third party payors  such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations  cover and pay for our products 
we cannot provide any assurances that third party payors will provide adequate coverage of and reimbursement for any of our product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and payment levels for our product candidates from third party payors  physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them 
this in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability and future success 
in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory policies and proposals in recent years to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or the mma  which contains  among other changes to the law  a wide variety of changes that impact medicare reimbursement of pharmaceuticals to physicians and hospitals 
the mma requires that  as of january   payment rates for most drugs covered under medicare part b  including drugs furnished incident to physicians services  are to be based on manufacturer s average sales price  or asp  of the product 
implementation of the asp payment methodology for drugs furnished in physician s offices generally resulted in reduced payments in  and could result in lower payment rates for drugs in the future 
the mma requires that  beginning in  payment amounts for most drugs administered in physician offices are to be based on either asp or on amounts bid by vendors under the competitive acquisition program  or cap 
under the cap  physicians who administer drugs in their offices will be offered an option to acquire drugs covered under the medicare part b benefit from vendors that are selected in a competitive bidding process 
winning vendors would be selected based on criteria that include their bid prices 
implementation of the cap has been delayed until at least july implementation of the asp payment methodology and the cap could negatively impact our ability to sell our product candidates 
the mma also revised the method by which medicare pays for many drugs administered in hospital outpatient departments beginning in in addition  the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  which administers the medicare program  published a proposed rule on payment amounts for drugs administered in hospital outpatient departments for as a result of the changes in the mma and  if the methods suggested by cms in the proposed rule are implemented  certain newly introduced drugs administered in hospital outpatient departments  which we believe would include our therapeutics and supportive care product candidates  will generally be reimbursed under an asp payment methodology  except that during a short introductory period in which drugs have not been assigned a billing code a higher payment rate is applicable 
as in the case of physician offices  implementation of the asp payment methodology in the hospital outpatient department could negatively impact our abili ty to sell our product candidates 
the mma created a new  voluntary prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries  medicare part d  which took effect in medicare part d is a new type of coverage that allows for payment for certain prescription drugs not covered under part b 
this new benefit will be offered by private managed care organizations and freestanding prescription drug plans  which  subject to review and approval by cms  may  and are expected to  establish drug formularies and other drug utilization management controls based in part on the price at which they can obtain the drugs involved 
the drugs that will be covered in each therapeutic category and class on the formularies of participating part d plans may be limited  and obtaining favorable treatment on formularies and with respect to utilization management controls may affect the prices we can obtain for our products 
if our product candidates are not placed on such formularies  or are subject to utilization man agement controls  this could negatively impact our ability to sell them 
it is difficult to predict which of our candidate products will be placed on the formularies or subjected to utilization management controls and the impact that the part d program  and the mma generally  will have on us 
there also likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals that could bring about significant changes in the healthcare industry 
we cannot predict what form those changes might take or the impact on our business of any legislation or regulations that may be adopted in the future 
the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue  attain profitability or commercialize our products 
in addition  in many foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control 
we may face competition for our product candidates from lower priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products 
in addition  there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products which could negatively impact our profitability 
if we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our product candidates receive fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
if approved  marqibo will compete with unencapsulated vincristine  which is generic  other cytotoxic agents such as antimetabolites  alkylating agents  cytotoxic antibiotics  vinca alkyloids  platinum compounds and taxanes  and other cytotoxic agents that use different encapsulation technologies 
these or other future competing products and product candidates may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products  or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
if our products fail to capture and maintain market share  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
we will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do  as well as significantly greater experience in developing drugs  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of drugs  formulating and manufacturing drugs  and launching  marketing and selling drugs 
developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
companies that currently sell both generic and proprietary compounds for the treatment of cancer include  among others  pfizer  inc trimetrexate  eli lilly co 
pemetrexed  novartis ag edatrexate  and allos therapeutics  inc pdx 
alternative technologies are being developed to treat cancer and immunological disease  several of which are in advanced clinical trials 
in addition  companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition 
many of these organizations have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel  parties for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
risks related to our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others  the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish 
our success  competitive position and future revenues will depend in large part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products  methods  processes and other technologies  to preserve our trade secrets  to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have licensed from third parties rights to numerous issued patents and patent applications 
to date  through our license agreements for marqibo  alocrest  brakiva and kyrbax  we hold certain exclusive patent rights  including rights under us patents and us patent applications 
we also have patent rights to applications pending in several foreign jurisdictions 
we have filed and anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the united states and internationally  as appropriate 
the rights to product candidates that we acquire from licensors or collaborators are protected by patents and proprietary rights owned by them  and we rely on the patent protection and rights established or acquired by them 
we generally do not unilaterally control  or do not control at all  the prosecution of patent applications licensed from third parties 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we may exercise over internally developed intellectual property 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
even if we are able to obtain patents  any patent may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
the existence of a patent will not necessarily protect us from competition 
competitors may successfully challenge our patents  produce similar drugs or products that do not infringe our patents or produce drugs in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or that do not respect our patents 
under our license agreements  we generally do not unilaterally control  or do not control at all  the enforcement of the licensed patents or the defense of third party suits of infringement or invalidity 
furthermore  if we become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
as a result of such litigation or proceedings we could lose our proprietary position and be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing and selling the affected products  incur significant damage awards  including punitive damages  or be required to seek third party licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain in part because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights  and we will not be able to ensure that we or our licensors or collaborators were the first to make the inventions described in patent applications  we or our licensors or collaborators were the first to file patent applications for inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights  any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  any patents licensed or issued to us will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  we will ultimately be able to enforce our owned or licensed patent rights pertaining to our products  any patents licensed or issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented  we will develop or license proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
our success also depends upon the skills  knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel  our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors and contractors 
to help protect our proprietary know how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements 
to this end  we require all of our employees to enter into agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and  where applicable  require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions important to our business 
these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information 
if any of our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information is disclosed  the value of our trade secrets  know how and ot her proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer 
our license agreements relating to our product candidates may be terminated in the event we commit a material breach  the result of which would harm our business and future prospects 
our license agreement with albert einstein college of medicine  or aecom  provides that aecom may terminate the agreement  after providing us with notice and an opportunity to cure  for our material breach or default  upon our bankruptcy 
in the event these license agreements are terminated  we will lose all of our rights to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate covered by such license  which would harm our business and future prospects 
our license to marqibo  alocrest and brakiva are governed by a series of transaction agreements which may be individually or collectively terminated  not only by tekmira  but also by md anderson cancer center  british columbia cancer agency or university of british columbia under the underlying agreements governing the license or assignment of technology to tekmira 
tekmira may terminate these agreements for our uncured material breach  for our involvement in a bankruptcy  for our assertion or intention to assert any in validity challenge on any of the patents licensed to us for these products or for our failure to meet our development or commercialization obligations  including the obligations of continuing to sell each product in all major market countries after its launch 
in the event that these agreements are terminated  not only will we lose all rights to these products  we will also have the obligation to transfer all of our data  materials  regulatory filings and all other documentation to our licensor  and our licensor may on its own exploit these products without any compensation to us  regardless of the progress or amount of investment we have made in the products 
third party claims of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our products 
in order to protect or enforce patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
similarly  we may be sued by others 
we also may become subject to proceedings conducted in the us patent and trademark office  including interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions  or reexamination proceedings 
in addition  any foreign patents that are granted may become subject to opposition  nullity  or revocation proceedings in foreign jurisdictions having such proceedings opposed by third parties in foreign jurisdictions having opposition proceedings 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
no patent can protect its holder from a claim of infringement of another patent 
therefore  our patent position cannot and does not provide any assurance that the commercialization of our products would not infringe the patent rights of another 
while we know of no actual or threatened claim of infringement that would be material to us  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted 
if such a claim is asserted  there can be no assurance that the resolution of the claim would permit us to continue marketing the relevant product on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion 
if we do not successfully defend any infringement actions to which we become a party or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid or unenforceable  we may have to pay substantial monetary damages  which can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful  or be required to discontinue or significantly delay commercialization and development of the affected products 
any legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin developmental or marketing activities relating to affected products could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our collaborators to obtain licenses to continue to develop  manufacture or market the affected products 
such a license may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
an adverse determination in a proceeding involving our owned or licensed intellectual property may allow entry of generic substitutes for our products 
risks related to our securities our stock price has  and we expect it to continue to  fluctuate significantly  and the value of your investment may decline 
from january  to december   the market price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investment  to sell shares at a profit at any given time  or to plan purchases and sales in advance 
you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the offering price due to fluctuations in the market price of the common stock arising from changes in our operating performance or prospects 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the markets for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
a variety of factors may affect our operating performance and cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 
these include  but are not lim ited to announcements by us or our competitors of regulatory developments  clinical trial results  clinical trial enrollment  regulatory filings  product development updates  new products and product launches  significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  any intellectual property infringement  product liability or any other litigation involving us  developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  economic or other crises and other external factors  actual or anticipated period to period fluctuations in our revenues and other results of operations  departure of any of our key management personnel  or sales of our common stock 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  which may limit investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity or value of our common stock 
if our results do not meet analysts forecasts and expectations  our stock price could decline 
while research analysts and others have published forecasts as to the amount and timing of our future revenues and earnings  we have stated that we will not be providing any forecasts of the amount and timing of our future revenues and earnings until after two quarters of our sales and marketing efforts 
analysts who cover our business and operations provide valuations regarding our stock price and make recommendations whether to buy  hold or sell our stock 
our stock price may be dependent upon such valuations and recommendations 
analysts valuations and recommendations are based primarily on our reported results and their forecasts and expectations concerning our future results regarding  for example  expenses  revenues  clinical trials  regulatory marketing approvals and competition 
our future results are subject to substantial uncertainty  and we may fail to meet or exceed analysts forecasts and expectations as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed under the section risks related to our business 
if our results do not meet analysts forecasts and expectations  our stock price could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise 
we have received notice from the nasdaq stock market that we fail to comply with certain of its continued listing requirements  which may result in the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global market our common stock is currently listed for trading on the nasdaq global market  and the continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards 
on february   we received notice from nasdaq informing us that for consecutive trading days  the bid price of our common stock has closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
nasdaq further informed us that we have until august  in order to regain compliance with rule a 
to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least for consecutive trading days and in certain cases  longer 
if prior to august   our common stock regains compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  nasdaq will send us a notice informing us that we have regained compliance with its continued listing requirements  assuming we ar e then in compliance with all other continued listing requirements 
if we are not able to regain compliance with rule a by august   nasdaq will provide us with written notice that our common stock is being delisted from the nasdaq global market 
at that time  we may appeal the delisting determination to a nasdaq listings qualifications panel pursuant to applicable nasdaq rules 
alternatively  we may be permitted under nasdaq rules to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq capital market if our common stock satisfies all criteria  other than compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  for initial inclusion on such market 
in the event of such a transfer  the nasdaq marketplace rules provide that we will be afforded an additional calendar days to comply with the minimum bid price requirement while listed on the nasdaq capital market 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq global market and the nasdaq capital market  trading in our common stock would likely be conducted on the otc bulletin board  a regulated quotation service 
if our common stock is delisted from nasdaq  the liquidity of our common stock may be reduced  not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price  but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in security analysts and the media s coverage of us 
this may result in lower prices for our common stock than might otherwise be obtained and could also result in a larger spread between the bid and asked prices for our common stock 
in addition  if our common stock is no longer listed on either the nasdaq global market or capital market  we will have triggered an event of default under our october  facility agreement with deerfield capital  pursuant to which we have established a line of credit to borrow up to million 
if we default under the facility agreement  deerfield can require us to immediately repay all principal and accrued interest outstanding under this facility 
to date  we have drawn down million under this agreement 
further  if our common stock is no longer traded on a national exchange  we will have triggered a default under the terms of the warrants we issued to deerfield in connection with the facility agreement 
in the event of default  under the deerfield warrants  deerfield has the right to require us to redeem the warrants for cash at their black scholes merton value 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years 
if we faced such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
because we do not expect to pay dividends  you will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock unless and until you sell your shares at profit 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future 
you should not rely on an investment in our stock if you require dividend income 
further  you will only realize income on an investment in our shares in the event you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares at a price higher than the price you paid for your shares 
such a gain would result only from an increase in the market price of our common stock  which is uncertain and unpredictable

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing  and commercializing innovative products to strengthen the foundation of cancer care 
we are committed to creating value by accelerating the development of our product candidates  including entering into strategic partnership agreements and expanding our product candidate pipeline by being an alliance partner of choice to universities  research centers and other companies 
we currently have rights to the following product candidates in various stages of development marqibo vincristine sulfate liposomes injection we acquired our rights to marqibo from tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation formerly inex pharmaceuticals corporation in may marqibo has been evaluated in clinical trials with over patients  including phase clinical trials in patients with nhl and all 
based on the results from these studies  we are conducting a registration enabling phase clinical trial 
the study population is adults with philadelphia chromosome negative all in second relapse or those who failed prior lines of therapy 
the primary outcome measure is confirmed complete remission cr or complete remission without full platelet recovery crp 
the sample size is evaluable subjects at approximately sites 
we also plan to conduct a confirmatory  phase front line trial 
the study population is elderly subjects at least years of age with newly dia gnosed philadelphia chromosome negative all 
the primary outcome measure is event free survival efs with death  failure to achieve cr crp  and relapse after cr crp as events 
we are also conducting a pilot  phase study to assess the efficacy of marqibo as determined by response rates in patients with metastatic malignant uveal melanoma 
secondary objectives are to assess the safety and antitumor activity of marqibo as determined by response duration  time to progression  and overall survival 
the patient population is defined as adults with uveal melanoma and confirmed metastatic disease that is untreated or that has progressed following one prior therapy 
we expect to enroll up to subjects in this clinical trial 
marqibo received a us orphan drug designation in january and a fast track designation in august for the treatment of adult all from the fda 
alocrest vinorelbine liposomes injection in february  we completed enrollment in a phase study of alocrest 
the trial enrolled adult subjects with confirmed solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy was known to exist  or with relapsed and or refractory nhl or hodgkin s disease 
the objectives of the phase clinical trial were to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with alocrest  to determine the maximum tolerated dose of alocrest  to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of alocrest  and to explore preliminary efficacy of alocrest 
the study was conducted at the cancer therapy and research center and start  both located in san antonio  texas and at mcgill university in montreal 
reversible neutropenia  a low white blood cell count  was the most common dose limiting toxicity 
promising anti cancer activity and acceptable and predictable toxicity was demonstrated and a disease control rate was achieved across a broad range of doses 
brakiva topotecan liposomes injection we have completed essential preclinical investigational new drug application ind activation enabling studies for brakiva 
we currently have an open and activated ind in the us and plan to initiate a phase dose escalation clinical trial in the second half of kyrbax menadione we acquired the rights to kyrbax in october pursuant to a license agreement with the albert einstein college of medicine aecom 
we have finalized an initial formulation of kyrbax and completed essential ind enabling studies 
we currently have an open and activated ind in the us and canada and plan to initiate a phase clinical trial in the first half of to date  we have not received regulatory approval and marketing authorization for any drug candidates in any market 
however we have received revenues from a sublicense agreement entered into with par pharmaceuticals in july for zensana 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various laws and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
also  if we are unable to enter into strategic partnerships  we may not be able to develop or we may be for ced to slow down development and commercialization of some or all our product candidates 
we will not generate any product commercial sales until we receive approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin marketing and selling our pharmaceutical candidates 
developing pharmaceutical products  however  is a lengthy and very expensive process 
in addition  as we continue the development of our remaining product pipeline  our research and development expenses will further increase 
to the extent we are successful in acquiring additional product candidates for our development pipeline  our need to finance further research and development will continue increasing 
our success depends not only on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  but also on our ability to finance the development of these product candidates or in some instances  enter into strategic partnerships 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private financings  primarily private sales of our common stock and other equity securities 
revenues we do not expect to generate any significant revenue from product sales or royalties in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that any revenues that we may recognize in the near future will be related to upfront  milestone development funding payments received pursuant to strategic license agreements or partnerships and that we may have large fluctuations of revenue recognized from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and the amount of these payments 
we may be unable to control the development of commercialization of these products and may be unable to estimate the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized pursuant to these agreements 
revenue from these agreements and partnerships help us fund our continuing operations 
our revenues may increase in the future if we are able to develop and commercialize our products  license our technology and or enter into strategic partnerships 
if we are unsuccessful  our future revenues will decrease and we may be forced to limit our de velopment of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development  manufacturing  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property protection  business development and organizational affairs and other expenses relating to the acquiring  design  development  testing  and enhancement of our product candidates  including milestone payments for licensed technology 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including accounting and general legal activities 
share based compensation share based compensation expenses consist primarily of expensing the fair market value of a share based award over the vesting term 
this expense is included in our operating expenses for each reporting period 
as of december   we estimate that there is million in total  unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested share based awards  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe there are certain accounting policies that are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  as these policies affect the reported amounts of expenses and involve management s judgment regarding significant estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and their application in the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r requiring that compensation cost relating to all share based employee payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes merton option pricing model  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for share based awards granted after we became a public entity and the prospective method for share based awards granted prior to the time we became a public entity and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of recognizing compensation cost relating to stock options 
in applying the modified prospective transition method of sfas no 
r  we estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
as allowed by sfas no 
r for companies with a short period of publicly traded stock history  our estimate of expected volatility is based on the average expected volatilities of a sampling of five companies with similar attributes to us  including industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
as we have so far only awarded plain vanilla options as described by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  we used the simplified method for determining the expected life of the options granted 
originally  under sab  this method was allowed until december  however  on december   the sec issued sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which will allow a company to continue to use the simplifi ed method under certain circumstances  which we will continue to use as we do not have sufficient historical data to estimate the expected term of share based award 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation 
sfas no 
r does not allow companies to account for option forfeitures as they occur 
instead  estimated option forfeitures must be calculated upfront to reduce the option expense to be recognized over the life of the award and updated upon the receipt of further information as to the amount of options expected to be forfeited 
based on our historical information  we currently estimate that annually of our stock options awarded will be forfeited 
for options granted while we were a nonpublic entity  we applied the prospective method in which the awards that were valued under the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes will continue to be expensed using t he intrinsic value method of apb prior to january   we accounted for option grants to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the guidelines of apb no 
 we were only required to record a charge for grants of options to employees if on the date of grant they had an intrinsic value which was calculated based on the excess  if any  of the market value of the common stock underlying the option over the exercise price 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
the black scholes merton option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes merton and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas no 
r  sab no 
and sab no 
is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this form k report for further information regarding the sfas no 
r disclosures 
warrant liabilities on october   we entered into a loan facility agreement with certain affiliates of deerfield management deerfield 
deerfield has committed funds to assist with the development of our product candidates 
under the agreement  we may borrow from deerfield up to an aggregate of million  of which million may be drawn down by us in as many as four installments every six months commencing october  as additional consideration for the loan  we also issued to deerfield year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  of which  includes an anti dilution feature 
this feature requires that  as we issue additional shares of our common stock during the term of the warrant  the number of shares purchasable under this series is automatically increased so that they always represent of our then outstanding common stock 
pursuant to the ag reement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement  so that deerfield may sell their shares if the warrants are exercised 
these financing transactions were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
because the warrants are redeemable in the event of a change in control or if our shares are delisted from a national securities exchange  the fair value of the warrants based on the black scholes merton option pricing model is recorded as a liability 
we update our estimate of the fair value of the warrant liabilities in each reporting period as new information becomes available and any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value from period to period are included as an increase or decrease of interest expense 
licensed in process research and development licensed in process research and development relates primarily to technology  intellectual property and know how acquired from another entity 
we evaluate the stage of development as well as additional time  resources and risks related to development and eventual commercialization of the acquired technology 
as we historically have acquired non fda approved technologies  the nature of the remaining efforts for completion and commercialization generally include completion of clinical trials  completion of manufacturing validation  interpretation of clinical and preclinical data and obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory bodies 
the cost in resources  probability of success and length of time to commercialization are extremely difficult to determine 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with respect to the timely completion of development projects  including clinical trial results  manufacturing process development results and ongoing feedback from regulatory authorities  including obtaining marketing approval 
additionally  there is no guarantee that the acquired technology will ever be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals  the cost of sales to produce these products in a commerci al setting  changes in the reimbursement environment or the introduction of new competitive products 
due to the risks and uncertainties noted above  we will expense such licensed in process research and development projects when incurred 
however  the cost of acquisition of technology is capitalized if there are alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise based on internal review 
all milestone payments will be expensed in the period the milestone is reached 
clinical study activities and other expenses from third party contract research organizations much of our research and development activities related to clinical study activity are conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
expense incurred for these contracted activities are based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers  and adjustments are made accordingly 
revenue recognition we recognize all revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  where revenue is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the services  supplies or technology license has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from the license or assignment of intellectual property and rights to third parties  including development milestone payments associated with such agreement if the funds have been received  the rights to the property have been delivered  and we have no further obligations on the date s when the payment has been received or collection is assured 
to date  we have only earned revenue from a non refundable upfront payment pursuant to a sublicense agreement  as described further in note in the notes to financial statements section of this form k 
recent accounting pronouncements on september   fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurement 
the statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this statement references fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the statement does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
originally  the statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
on february   fasb delayed the effective date so that the statement is now effective for financial statements issued for the fiscal years beginning after november  an d interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
on february   fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement provides entities the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply the hedge accounting provisions as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas requires all entities to report non controlling minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires that transactions between an entity and non controlling interests are treated as equity transactions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not own subsidiaries and as such  adoption of sfas is expected to have no impact on our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative  or g a  expense was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million is due primarily to a decrease in salaries  other employee benefits and personnel related costs of approximately million  which includes a decrease of million in employee related share based compensation expense  and an increase of million in salary and benefits  due mainly to the hiring of a commercial team for the potential launch of zensana in early  which was subsequently terminated in april  when the zensana program was halted 
the main reason for the decrease in employee related share based compensation is due to the former ceo resigning in september and a lower stock price in compared to for the year ended december   we also incurred an increase of approximately million in as sociated professional fees and outside services  mainly due to an increase of million in professional fees  mostly related to general legal fees and board member fees  and a decrease of million in share based compensation for awards issued to consultants and other non employees 
also for the year ended december   there was an decrease of approximately million in allocable expenses  including a decrease of million in rent  insurance  depreciation and other allocable expenses  and a decrease of million in conference and travel costs  related mainly to the pre launch activities for zensana in for previously planned commercial launch in research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development  or r d  expense was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million is due primarily to a decrease in employee related expenses of million  a decrease in direct drug development costs  professional fees and outside services of million  an increase in rent  depreciation  insurance and other allocated expenses of million 
employee related expenses decreased by million in due to a decrease of share based compensation expense of million  offset partially by an increase of million in salaries  bonuses and other employee related expenses as the headcount in r d departments increased in compared to the decrease of million in expenses for the clinical development of our product pipeline  includes a decrease of million in license fees and milestone fees and transaction services related to the tekmira  zensana  menadione and talvesta license agreements  which were non recurring expenses in we did not enter into any in license transactions in  and we did not reach any payment milestones in related to our license agreements 
additionally  we had a decrease in direct development costs for our product candidates 
these clinical costs included the physical manufacturing of drug compounds and payments to our contract research organizations 
also  we had a decrease in expenses related to product candidates that are no longer in our pipeline ipdr expenses decreased million in this development program was terminated in february zensana expenses decreased by million in the zensana program was halted in the first quarter of and an nda filed with the fda in was pulled 
in july  we entered into a sub license agreement with par pharmaceuticals  wherein par will be responsible for all development and related costs going forward 
talvesta expenses decreased by million in after the program was put on clinical hold in early and later terminated in october the decreases in development costs for these drug candidates were partially offset by increases in our ongoing programs marqibo expenses increased by million in as we initiated a phase trial in all in the second half of the year 
alocrest expenses increased by million in as we continued enrolling in a phase trial and increased manufacturing expenditures in anticipation of a potential phase trial 
brakiva expenses increased by million in as we activated the ind in and prepared for a phase trial in mid kyrbax expenses increased by million in as pre clinical and manufacturing expenses increased prior to the ind being filed in late and in anticipation of the phase trial that commenced in early additionally  other professional fees and outside service expenses increased by million in  mostly due to increased consulting fees for our biostatistics and medical safety programs 
other allocable operating expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this includes an increase in travel and conference expenses of million  and an increase in rent  insurance and other allocated costs of million as head count increased in over interest income 
for the year ended december   interest income was million as compared to interest income of million for the year ended december  the decrease of million resulted from decreased cash balance in our interest bearing accounts 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense was million as compared to interest expense of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from accrued interest related to an outstanding loan balance from a draw down of funds on november  pursuant to the facility loan agreement with deerfield 
other income expense  net 
for the year ended december   net other expense was million as compared to net other expense of million for the year ended december  the increase of million is due mainly to realized losses of million due to impairment of our available for sale securities 
gain on change in fair market value of warrant liabilities 
for the year ended december   we recognized a gain related to the change in fair market value of the warrant liabilities  pursuant to the warrants issued to deerfield as part of the facility loan agreement see note of million 
there was no such transaction in income tax expense 
there was no current or deferred income tax expense other than state minimum tax for the years ended december  and because of our operating losses 
a valuation allowance has been recorded against our million of deferred tax assets as of december  historical performance leads management to believe that realization of these assets is uncertain 
as a result of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had aggregate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million 
in october  we entered into a loan facility agreement with deerfield management  which has committed million to fund the development of our product candidates and other general corporate activities 
as of december   we had drawn down million of the total million available under the agreement 
our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as equity and debt financing 
through december   a significant portion of our financing has been and will continue to be through private placements of common stock  preferred stock and debt financing 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
given the current and desired pace of clinical development of our product candidates  we estimate that we w ill have sufficient cash on hand  together with amounts committed under our loan facility agreement with deerfield  to fund clinical development into the second half of we may  however  choose to raise additional capital before then in order to fund our future development activities  likely by selling shares of our capital stock or through debt financing 
if we are unable to raise additional capital or enter into strategic partnerships and or license agreements  we will likely be forced to curtail our desired development activities  which will delay the development of our product candidates 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
we will need additional financing thereafter until we can achieve profitability  if ever 
in july  we entered into a sublicense agreement with par pharmaceuticals  upon the execution of which  we received aggregate consideration of million in exchange for  shares of our common stock and the rights to our product candidate zensana 
on october   we entered into a loan facility agreement with deerfield 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we may borrow from deerfield up to an aggregate of million  of which million may be drawn down by us in as many as four installments every six months commencing october  pursuant to such schedule  we drew down million on november  the remaining million of the loan is subject to disbursement in three installments upon the achievement of clinical development milestones relating to our marqibo and kyrbax product candidates 
deerfield s obligation to disburse loan proceeds expires october  and we must repay all outstanding amounts owing under the loan no later than october  current and future financing needs 
our plan of operation for the year ending december  is to continue implementing our business strategy  including the continued development of our four product candidates that are currently in clinical and preclinical phases 
we expect our principal expenditures during the next months to include operating expenses  including expanded research and development and general and administrative expenses  product development expenses  including the costs incurred with respect to applications to conduct clinical trials in the united states  as well as outside of the united states  for our product candidates  including manufacturing  intellectual property prosecution and regulatory compliance 
as part of our planned research and development  we intend to use clinical research organizations and third parties to help perform our clinical studies and manufacturing 
as indicated above  at our current and desired pace of clinical development of our product candidates  over the next months we expect to spend approximately between million and million on clinical development including milestone payments of million that we expect to be triggered under the license agreements relating to our product candidates  all of which can be satisfied through the issuance of new shares of our common stock at our discretion  million on general corporate and administrative expenses  including million on facilities and rent 
we may receive additional debt funding under the deerfield agreement upon reaching certain development milestones  which may be used to fund the milestone payments that will be owed under our license agreements with aecom and tekmira 
nb sp  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million as of december   along with the funds available through the deerfield agreement  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs into the second half of based upon current operating and spending assumptions 
however  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue our drug discovery and development efforts  particularly to the extent we advance our lead candidate marqibo through a pivotal clinical study 
we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following costs associated with conducting preclinical and clinical testing  costs of establishing arrangements for manufacturing our product candidates  payments required under our current and any future license agreements and collaborations  costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  costs of obtaining  maintaining and defending patents on our product candidates  and costs of increased general and administrative expenses 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
we may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate 
potential sources of financing include strategic relationships  public or private sales of our stock or debt and other sources 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long term capital requirements 
we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time  and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted 
if we are not able to obtain financing when needed  we may be unable to carry out our business plan 
as a result  we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business  financial co ndition and results of operations would be materially harmed 
research and development projects the discussion below describes for each of our development projects the research and development expenses we have incurred to date and  to the extent we are able to reasonably ascertain  the amounts we estimate we will have to expend in order to complete development of each project and the time we estimate it will take to complete development of each project 
in addition to those identified under item a of this annual report  our assumptions relating to the expected costs of development and timeframe for completion are dependent on numerous factors  including the availability of capital  unforeseen safety issues  lack of effectiveness  and significant unforeseen delays in the clinical trial and regulatory approval process  any of which could be extremely costly 
in addition  our estimates assume that we will be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in clinical trials 
since our business does not currently generate any cash flow  however  we will need to raise additional capital to continue development of our product candidates beyond the first half of if we are to raise such capital  we expect to raise it primarily by selling shares of our capital stock 
to the extent additional capital is not available when we need it  we may be forced to discontinue or scale back our development efforts relating to one or more of our product candidates or we may need to out license the rights to one or more of our product candidates to a third party  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of our business

pending finalization of the protocol with cooperative groups and approval by the cancer therapy evaluation program ctep  we anticipate conducting a confirmatory phase supportive trial in front line all potentially commencing in the second half of we estimate that we will need to expend at least an aggregate of approximately million in order for us to obtain fda approval for marqibo  if ever  which includes a milestone payment that would be owed to our licensor upon fda approval

the development of pharmaceutical product candidates is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the following risk of delays in or discontinuation of development from lack of financing  our inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals to market the products  unforeseen safety issues relating to the products  our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials  and dependence on third party collaborators to conduct research and development of the products 
additionally  on a historical basis  only approximately of all product candidates that enter human clinical trials are eventually approved for sale
