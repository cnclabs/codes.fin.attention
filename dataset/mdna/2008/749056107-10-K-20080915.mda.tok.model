item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market highway and transportation safety products to protect  direct and inform motorists  pedestrians and road workers in both domestic and international markets 
our continuing operations are comprised of two reportable segments within the highway and transportation safety industry 
our two reportable segments are the manufacture and sale of highway and transportation safety products which protect and direct and the manufacture and sale of highway products and services which inform motorists and highway personnel 
the protect and direct segment provides solutions for improving safety on the roads either by minimizing the severity of crashes that occur or by preventing crashes from occurring by directing or guiding traffic 
the primary product lines within the protect and direct segment include energy absorbing products such as crash cushions  truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels and water filled barriers  and directing and guiding products such as flexible post delineators and glare screen systems 
the inform segment provides solutions for improving traffic flow and safety on roads and runways by providing information 
the primary product lines within the inform segment include advanced sensing products which measure distance  count and classify vehicles  weather sensing systems and computerized highway advisory radio transmitting systems 
our products are sold worldwide primarily through a distribution network and supplemented by a direct sales force to customers in the highway construction and safety business  state and municipal departments of transportation  and other governmental transportation agencies 
the domestic market for highway and transportation safety products is directly affected by federal  state and local governmental policies and budgets 
a portion of our domestic sales is ultimately financed by funds provided to the states by the federal government 
historically  these funds have covered to of the cost of highway safety projects on roads constructed or maintained with federal assistance 
seasonality affects our business with generally a higher level of sales in our fourth fiscal quarter 
discontinued operations on july   we sold our intersection control segment to signal group  inc for million in cash 
the intersection control segment sold products including traffic controllers  traffic and pedestrian signals  traffic uninterruptible power supply ups systems  video detection equipment and toll road monitoring systems 
accordingly  we reflect the results of those operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of the divested segment are classified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented 
the sale of this business allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our financial flexibility as we focus on international markets for our protect and direct and inform segments 
results of continuing operations summary sales decreased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal due to decreased sales for the protect and direct and inform segments 
overall  domestic sales decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal due to decreases in both our protect and direct and our inform segments 
domestic sales for the protect and direct segment decreased and sales for the inform segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we began to see a general economic slowdown in the united states causing many states and municipalities to face budgetary constraints and deficits 
in addition  basic material costs including steel  asphalt and other materials for building and maintaining roads and bridges increased significantly 
facing these issues  many states postponed or cancelled many transportation projects which adversely impacted the domestic demand for our products 

table of contents given the softness in the domestic economy  we focused our efforts on international sales opportunities during fiscal international sales increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal international sales for the protect and direct segment increased and increased for the inform segment for fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in international sales were driven by growth in both the asia pacific and european regions 
the overall lower sales volumes in fiscal  unfavorable product sales mix and increased raw materials costs resulted in lower gross profit margin for both segments in fiscal as a result  operating profit also decreased in fiscal  offset somewhat by decreased selling and administrative expenses 
see future outlook for further information

geographic international sales for fiscal increased by  or  to  compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to increases in the protect and direct segment  where international sales increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal 
table of contents the increase in international sales in the protect and direct segment was primarily due to increased sales of triton water filled barriers and crash cushions in the asia pacific region  including china  and to increased sales in europe 
international sales for the inform segment increased to  primarily due to increased sales of sensing products in europe and latin america 
domestic sales for fiscal decreased to  from  due to an decrease in the protect and direct segment and a decrease in the inform segment

international sales for the inform segment increased to  primarily due to increased sales of sensing products in canada 
domestic sales for fiscal decreased to  from  with decreases in both of our segments 
protect and direct net sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal due principally to lower domestic sales of permanent crash cushions  truck mounted attenuators tma s and barrels  offset somewhat by increased sales of parts and delineators 
the domestic sales decreases of certain product lines were attributable to decreased spending on highway safety projects due to funding issues related to the soft economy 
in addition  fiscal included a million order from the state of illinois for tma s which was not repeated in fiscal the segment had strong sales internationally in fiscal as those markets are increasingly recognizing the importance of our safety devices 
the quest crash cushion product line reached targeted record sales aided by million in sales in china 
sales of triton water filled barriers to international markets were also at record levels in fiscal net sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due principally to strong sales internationally 
domestically sales were flat with increased sales of tma s offset somewhat by decreased sales of permanent crash cushions 
the sales increases of certain product lines were attributable to increased spending on workzone and other highway safety projects since the enactment of the federal highway bill 
in addition  we saw increased spending on new products such as the sst safestop trailer tma 
inform net sales for the inform segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal  due to lower domestic sales of highway advisory radios  offset somewhat by increased sales of sensing products 
sales of highway advisory radios were at record levels in fiscal and included several large contracts 
net sales for the inform segment for fiscal increased slightly to  from  for fiscal excluding  in sales related to the weather forecasting product line which was sold at the end of fiscal  sales for the inform segment increased due to record sales of highway advisory radio products and increased sales of traffic sensing products 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the gross margin in the protect and direct segment decreased due to volume related inefficiencies related to the fixed nature of certain expenses  increased raw material costs  higher freight costs and unfavorable product sales mix as sales of higher margin permanent crash cushions decreased and sales of lower margin products such as the triton barriers and delineators increased 
the gross margin for the inform segment decreased due to volume related inefficiencies and unfavorable product sales mix as sales of higher margin highway advisory radio products decreased and sales of lower margin weather sensing products increased 

table of contents our gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the gross margin in the protect and direct segment improved due to volume related efficiencies offset somewhat by increased raw material costs  higher freight costs and unfavorable product sales mix 
the gross margin for the inform segment decreased due to unfavorable product sales mix 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal this was primarily due to decreased selling costs related to our lower sales volume along with decreased bad debt expense in both segments 
selling and administrative expenses in the protect and direct segment increased  relating to our new facility in beijing  china  opened near the end of fiscal selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for selling and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or  to  from  for fiscal selling and administrative expenses in the protect and direct segment increased due to variable expenses related to the increased level of sales and to expenses incurred in establishing our new facility in beijing  china 
selling and administrative costs for the inform segment decreased primarily due to lower personnel related expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for research and development research and development expenditures increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  due to increases in both segments for new product extensions 
research and development expenditures decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal due to decreases in both segments 
gain on sale of assets as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a gain on the sale of assets of  in fiscal this gain included a gain of  on the sale of a former manufacturing facility of the protect and direct segment and a gain of  resulting from final contingent proceeds relating to the sale of the weather forecasting product line in the inform segment 
we recorded a gain of  in fiscal in the inform segment related to the sale of the assets of the weather forecasting product line

net interest expense net interest expense for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates on our revolving bank debt and due to interest income received on an income tax refund in fiscal the interest rate on our bank credit facility is based on prime or libor  plus a margin 
our overall weighted average interest rate was as of june  compared to our weighted average rate of as of june  the interest rate on the company s convertible debt issued during fiscal is 
the company expects the average interest rate during fiscal on all debt to be approximately 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased slightly to  from  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to our lower level of average long term debt outstanding during fiscal and partially due to lower interest rates on our revolving bank debt 
income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate due to the utilization of r d credits 
we expect to provide for income taxes at a rate of for fiscal however  this rate may be negatively impacted based on management s ongoing evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets recorded are realizable 
the income tax provision for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate

table of contents net earnings net earnings for fiscal were  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks and other sources 
we had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june  we believe that our bank credit facility is an important source of liquidity 
the amended credit agreement provides for a million secured revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement includes both fixed and floating interest rate options  at the prime rate or libor rate  plus a margin 
the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants including requirements that we meet certain consolidated financial criteria  including a fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio and a maximum total leverage ratio 
the covenants also limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  acquisitions  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
we were either in compliance with these covenants or we received the necessary waivers from the bank through fiscal subsequent to june   we used the proceeds from the sale of the intersection control business to pay down substantially all of our bank debt and accordingly we reclassified the amount outstanding against the revolving credit facility as current as of june  the agreement currently expires in february  but may be renewed one additional year on each anniversary date upon mutual consent of the company and the bank 
our outstanding borrowings were  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding on our bank credit facility 
this compares to  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding on our bank credit facility 
included in long term debt as of june  and june  was million in convertible senior subordinated notes due february included in the current portion of long term debt as of june  was a million five year subordinated promissory note  which was paid on its due date in april the amount of standby letters of credit outstanding was  as of june  and  as of june  during february  we sold  of convertible senior subordinated notes due february  in a private placement and received net proceeds of  the net proceeds were used to pay off our bank term loan and reduce the amount outstanding on our revolving credit agreement 
the conversion price is per share  which represented a premium over the closing price of our stock on the close of the transaction 
if fully converted  the notes would convert into approximately  shares of our common stock 
the shares are not included in earnings per share as they are currently anti dilutive until earnings per share reach approximately per share 
the notes are fully redeemable by the company at any time after february  at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the investors may require us to repurchase the notes in cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on february   or cash flows cash flows provided by continuing operations were  during fiscal this compares with  in fiscal and  in fiscal in each of the past three years  cash flow from operations was primarily derived from earnings before non cash expenses such as depreciation  
table of contents amortization and share based compensation expense 
the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to changes in income taxes payable 
cash flows used in discontinued operations were  during fiscal this compares with  used in fiscal and  used in fiscal in each of the past three years  cash used in discontinued operations was primarily due to losses before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  non cash inventory disposals and asset impairment charges 
investing activities of continuing operations used cash of  during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we made expenditures during fiscal of  for capital and patent expenditures 
expenditures during fiscal were  for capital and patent expenditures  which were offset somewhat by proceeds received from the sale of assets 
investing activities of discontinued operations used cash of  for capital expenditures during fiscal in fiscal  discontinued operations generated  in cash as capital expenditures of  were more than offset by cash received from the sale of the automated traffic enforcement product line 
in fiscal  discontinued operations generated  in cash as the  in cash proceeds from the sale of the portable variable message sign  tunnel lighting and illuminated street sign product lines more than offset capital expenditures of  financing activities generated cash of  during fiscal  compared to cash used of  during fiscal and cash used of  in fiscal during fiscal  we borrowed a net  on our outstanding revolving credit facility and paid  on other notes payable 
the payment of our semi annual cash dividend used cash of  during fiscal  we borrowed a net  on our outstanding revolving credit facility and paid  on other notes payable 
we received cash of  from the exercise of common stock options in fiscal the payment of our semi annual cash dividend used cash of  for  we anticipate spending approximately  in cash for capital expenditures 
we may require additional investments in working capital to maintain growth 
we may also need additional funds to repurchase our common stock from time to time or if we acquire product lines or businesses that complement our existing operations 
these expenditures will be financed either through our cash on hand  cash generated from our operations or from borrowings available under our bank credit facility 
we currently expect cash generated from operations to be higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal however  there can be no assurance that this will occur  or to what extent this will occur 
we believe that our existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available under our existing credit facility are sufficient for all planned operating and capital requirements in the near term 
if needed and available on favorable terms  we may also enter into other debt or equity financing arrangements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are subject to certain debt obligations  guarantees  commitments and contingent liabilities further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents our contractual obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as of june  dollar amounts in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt estimated interest payments operating leases  net minimum royalty payments uncertain tax benefits retirement award program purchase obligations total amount includes expected cash payments on long term debt based upon current and effective maturities as well as expected renewals 
amount includes estimated interest payments based on interest rates as of the current period 
interest rates on variable rate debt are subject to change in the future 
interest is estimated based upon current and effective maturities as well as expected renewals of long term debt currently outstanding 
retirement award is a fixed number of quixote corporation shares for both of the participants for which the income tax obligation is paid in cash 
purchase obligations include non cancellable orders with suppliers in the normal course of business on a short term basis 
as disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  we have entered into bid and performance related bonds associated with various contracts 
potential payments due under these bonds are related to our performance under the applicable contracts 
the total amount of bid and performance related bonds that was available and undrawn as of june  was  we also have standby letters of credit covering potential workers compensation liabilities and other liabilities 
the total standby exposure relating to letters of credit as of june  was  future outlook looking forward  the domestic marketplace will remain challenging due to the difficult domestic economic environment  uncertain federal highway funding  state and municipal budgetary constraints and higher commodity prices 
the federal highway trust fund which funds spending on transportation projects relies on gasoline tax revenue 
with the increased price of gasoline  the number of miles driven has decreased significantly which depleted the surplus in the federal highway trust fund 
legislation is currently in the process of being approved to transfer billion from the general fund to the highway trust fund in an attempt to keep the fund solvent for the remainder of the term of the current federal funding legislation  safetea lu 
however  driving patterns may impact the future solvency of the highway trust fund 
safetea lu  currently expires september  delays in the passage of a new highway bill may likely occur 
safetea lu was delayed more than two years after the previous bill had expired 
even after federal legislation is enacted  funding appropriations may be revised in future congressional 
table of contents sessions  and federal funding for infrastructure projects may be reduced in the future 
these factors may continue to negatively impact domestic spending on our products affecting our financial performance in the near term 
however  both segments have introduced new products during fiscal and we believe we have positioned our business for growth once domestic infrastructure spending increases the demand for our products 
we expect international sales to continue to be an important driver of our sales growth and we plan to continue to focus on these markets to reduce our exposure to the current domestic economic conditions in the near term 
to meet increasing international sales demands and further penetrate emerging markets  we are investing in international growth opportunities 
in fiscal  we opened a new office in dubai to take advantage of the developing opportunities in the middle east  which is experiencing a construction boom 
we also are expanding our distributor base in europe 
near the end of last year  we opened a new sales and manufacturing facility in beijing  china to capitalize on its growing infrastructure needs 
we expect that sales from china will be uneven  similar to our experience in the early stages of other international markets  which may require us to fund their operations for an indefinite period 
in summary  we believe our near term domestic sales growth will be limited  if any 
we believe we will continue to see growth in international sales similar to the growth we ve seen in the past 
however  it is difficult to predict when and to what extent we will see increased spending for our products and there can be no assurance that either domestic or international sales will increase 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management s estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  certain normal and recurring estimates are made including estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation reserves  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  health care liabilities and determining stock based compensation expense 
these estimates are made using management s best judgment given relevant factors and available data 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to our june  consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies  methods and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes in accounting policies  methods and estimates used by management 
in the opinion of management  we do not have any individual accounting policy or use any individual estimate that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in most instances  we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 
we believe the following significant accounting policies and methods used by the company are the most important to the presentation of our financial statements discontinued operations and assets held for sale we consider businesses to be held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a business for sale 
upon designation as held for sale  the carrying value of the assets of the business are recorded at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
results of operations of a business classified as held for sale are reported as discontinued operations when a the operations and cash flows of the business will be eliminated from ongoing operations as a result of the sale and b the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the sale 
at june   the intersection control business is classified as held for sale and as a discontinued operation 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized when either services have been rendered or both title and risk of loss of products have been transferred to unaffiliated customers 
we ensure that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  and the revenue is fixed or determinable 
the majority of our sales are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon shipment of the product or performance of the service 
we also enter into agreements that contain multiple elements such as equipment  installation and service or non standard terms and conditions 
for multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for a delivered element when it has stand alone value to the customer  the fair values of undelivered elements are known  customer acceptance of the delivered element has occurred and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered element 
in addition  equipment revenue is not recorded until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation  or if installation is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts and credits is made base upon management s analysis of bad debts  credit and returns 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
actual costs are used to value raw materials and supplies 
standard costs  which approximate actual costs  are used to value finished goods and work in process 
standard costs include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels  ages and salability 
long lived assets long lived assets include such items as goodwill  patents  product rights  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we assess the possibility of obsolescence  demand  new technology  competition  and other pertinent economic factors and trends that may have an impact on the value or remaining lives of these assets 
in performing our impairment assessments  we first assess our indefinite lived intangibles  second  assess our amortized long lived assets including amortized intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  and third  assess our goodwill 
additionally  we reassess the remaining useful lives of our amortized long lived assets 
amortized long lived assets including amortized intangible assets and property  plant and equipment held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to future undiscounted cash flows of underlying asset groups 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
fair values of amortized long lived assets are determined based upon the performance of a fair value appraisal 
patents and other finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or systematic method over the life of the patent or intangible asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value in a one step analysis 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two step analysis 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  we perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit s fair value to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
fair values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies 
the impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash 
table of contents flow methods and are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends  market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
restructuring charges we account for restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
generally  costs associated with the exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred 
costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent that any future tax benefits are not expected to be fully realized  such future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income so that the assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
we expect the deferred tax assets currently recorded to be fully realizable  however there can be no assurance that an increased valuation allowance would not need to be recorded in the future 
on july  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as required under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize a tax position in the financial statements only if it has been determined that the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the tax benefit for each position that meets this threshold is then measured as the largest amount that is at least likely of being realized when ultimately settled 
consistent with prior practice  we will continue to record the interest related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense during the period incurred 
penalties related to uncertain tax positions are now recorded as part of the income tax expense during the period incurred 
the tax liability under fin is recorded in accrued expenses 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment as of july  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  share based compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year ended june  includes compensation cost for all share based awards which were unvested as of july  as well as compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

the fair value of the options granted is being amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility and to a very limited extent  currency exchange rates 
since the third quarter of fiscal  our exposure to interest rate fluctuations has been significantly reduced by our issuing convertible debt and using the proceeds to pay down the debt issued pursuant to the revolving credit agreement 
due to the lower exposure to rate fluctuations  the use of derivative instruments in the form of non trading interest rate swaps to manage the risk are no longer utilized 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of long term debt outstanding as of june  and was  and  respectively  of which  was convertible debt 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on our revolving credit facility would have adversely affected our and net earnings by approximately  and  respectively  and our cash flows by approximately  and  respectively 
assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies for transaction purposes are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the majority of our business is transacted in us dollars and the us dollar is considered the primary currency for the majority of our operations 
there were no significant transaction gains or losses during  or and we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material risk of loss from currency exchange fluctuations 
although we continue to evaluate derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  we did not hold such derivatives during or in the next few years we may confront greater risks from currency exchange fluctuations as our business expands internationally
