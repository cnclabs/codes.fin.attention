item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
this discussion also includes forward looking statements 
please refer to cautionary information about forward looking statements in part i of this form k for important information about these types of statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations entirely located in the united states 
we have determined that our business is comprised of only one segment because our gathering  processing and marketing activities are ancillary to our production operations and are not separately managed 
in  we achieved the following financial and operating results oil and gas production volumes averaged million cubic feet equivalent per day mmcfe d  up from mmcfe d in year end proved reserves totaled tcfe versus tcfe on december  we sold bcfe of proved reserves for million 
oil and gas sales totaled billion  a increase from cash flow from operating activities increased to million 
net income was million versus million in stockholders equity reached billion  a increase from year end our debt to total capitalization on december  was 
we had no bank debt and million of cash 
in may we sold million of ten year senior unsecured notes at par 
net proceeds were used to redeem our old notes and to reduce bank debt 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock 
we increased our regular quarterly common stock cash dividend from to per share 
we seek to achieve profitable growth in proved reserves and production primarily through exploration and development 
we generally fund our growth with cash flow provided by our operating activities 
to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk  we maintain a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
our oil and gas reserves and operations are mainly located in texas  oklahoma  new mexico  kansas  louisiana and wyoming 
to supplement our growth and to provide for new drilling opportunities  we also consider mergers and acquisitions 
in we acquired magnum hunter resources  inc  in a stock for stock merger with a total transaction value of approximately billion 
magnum hunter was a dallas based independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations concentrated in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico and in the gulf of mexico 
during we purchased million of assets  with the largest acquisition being in the texas panhandle area for million 
this transaction added over locations to our already active texas panhandle drilling program and eight bcfe of proved reserves 
from time to time we also consider selling certain assets 
during  we sold million of non core properties 
the two largest sales were million for our west texas spraberry oil properties and million for our gulf of mexico main pass area operated properties 
we continue to evaluate alternatives for the rest of our gulf of mexico assets 
oil and gas prices while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in prices have had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our annual average realized gas price increased from per mcf in to per mcf in  and oil prices increased from per barrel in to per barrel in in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  economic and geo political factors that we can neither control nor predict 
however  we have made limited use of hedging transactions to somewhat reduce price risk as discussed further below 
years ended december  gas prices average henry hub price mcf average realized sales price mcf effect of hedges mcf oil prices average wti cushing price bbl average realized sales price bbl on an energy equivalent basis  of our aggregate production was natural gas 
a per mcf change in our average realized gas sales price would have resulted in approximately a million change in our gas revenues 
similarly of our production was crude oil 
a per barrel change in our average realized crude oil sales price would have resulted in approximately a million change in our oil revenues 
to mitigate a portion of our exposure to potentially adverse gas market changes  in july we entered into certain derivative contracts covering approximately of our overall gas production and about of our estimated gas volumes 
we executed cash flow effective hedges by purchasing mmbtu put options on a portion of our and mid continent gas production 
we used the proceeds from selling call options on the same volume of gas to pay for the puts  thus establishing what is commonly known as a zero cost collar 
we hedged million mmbtu and million mmbtu for and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and item a of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
reserve replacement and growth because oil and gas are non renewable forms of energy resources  exploration and production companies face the challenge of resource depletion and natural production decline 
our operations also entail significant complexities that required the use of advanced technologies and highly trained personnel 
even when modern exploration technology is properly used  the interpreter still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present  the rate at which they will be produced  or economic viability 
historically  we have been able to grow our proved reserves and production each year through drilling and acquisitions 
future growth will continue to depend upon our ability to economically add reserves in excess of production 
in our total proved oil and gas reserves increased by from tcfe to tcfe 
this was despite production of bcfe and property sales of bcfe 
proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end natural gas comprised and of our total proved reserves at year end and  respectively 
our proved oil reserves at year end were mmbbls compared to mmbbls at the end of overall  about of our proved reserves are in our mid continent region and are in the permian basin 
our onshore gulf coast and other onshore operations collectively make another of total proved reserves 
only of our total proved reserves are in the gulf of mexico 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
for  revisions of previous estimates boosted proved reserves by bcfe or of total proved reserves on december  most of our positive revisions resulted from higher oil and gas prices and new data for one of our large fields in wyoming 
see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more reserve information 
in most years our primary source for reserve replacement and growth is exploration and development e d 
we invested million on e d during and  million in approximately of expenditures were in the mid continent area  in the permian basin  in the gulf coast area  and in the gulf of mexico 
we project that exploration and development expenditures will range from billion to billion 
cash flow from operating activities for totaled million  which more than funded our drilling program 
based on expected cash flow provided by operating activities  cash on hand and monies available under our bank credit facility  we are well positioned to fund the capital program we have planned for production and other operating expenses the costs associated with finding and producing oil and gas are substantial 
some of these costs vary with oil and gas prices  some trend with production volume and some are a function of the number of wells we own 
at the end of  we owned interests in over  wells 
production expense generally consists of the cost of power and fuel  direct labor  third party field services  compression  water disposal  and certain maintenance activity necessary to produce oil and gas from existing wells 
transportation expense is comprised of costs paid to move oil and gas from the wellhead to a specified sales point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion expense  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities and estimates of future development costs or reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices and not directly associated with exploration  development or production activities 
while we expect these costs to increase with our growth  we also expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
production taxes are assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem and excise taxes 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and the expensing of stock options resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
net stock compensation expense in was million compared to million in the derivative fair value gain loss is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and fluctuates based on changes in the fair value of underlying commodities 
as of december  all contracts associated with derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment had settled 
the net derivative fair value gain was million in compared to a loss of million in results of operations compared to net income for was million  or per diluted share 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share in the small change in year over year net income is generally the result of higher oil and gas sales being offset by higher costs and expenses 
for the years ended december  percent change between price volume analysis oil and gas sales price volume variance in thousands or as indicated gas sales      oil sales     total oil and gas sales    total gas volume mcf gas volume mmcf per day average gas price per mcf effect of hedges per mcf total oil volume thousand barrels oil volume barrels per day   average oil price per barrel oil and gas sales during totaled billion  compared to billion in of the million increase in sales between the two periods  million related to higher production volumes and million resulted from higher prices 
compared to  our oil production increased by to an average of  barrels per day in this increase resulted in million of incremental revenues 
gas volumes averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in  resulting in a decrease in revenues of million 
total oil and gas production volumes were mmcfe per day  up mmcfe per day from both our gas and oil volumes increased as unfolded 
during the fourth quarter of our gas production averaged mmcf per day up from mmcf per day a increase in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter oil production increased by to  barrels per day  up from  barrels per day in average realized gas prices increased by to per mcf in  compared to per mcf for this price increased boosted gas sales by million between the two periods 
included in our realized gas price is million of cash receipts a positive per mcf effect from settlement of cash flow hedges on  mmbtu per day of mid continent gas production 
we currently have  mmbtu per day of our mid continent gas production hedged for at a floor price of mmbtu 
realized oil prices averaged per barrel during  compared to per barrel in the increase in oil sales resulting from this improvement in oil prices totaled million 
changes in realized gas and oil prices were mostly the result of overall market conditions and our modest gas hedging program 
we did not have any cash flow effective hedges in place for volumes 
for the years ended december  gas gathering  processing and marketing in thousands gas gathering and processing revenues   gas gathering and processing costs   gas gathering and processing margin   gas marketing revenues  net of related costs   we sometimes transport  process and market third party gas that is associated with our gas 
in  third party gas gathering and processing contributed million of pre tax cash operating margin revenues less direct cash expenses versus million in our gas marketing margin revenues less purchases increased to million in from million in increases in net margins from gas gathering  processing and marketing activities are the direct result of increased volumes and overall market conditions 
for the years ended december  variance between operating costs and expenses in thousands depreciation  depletion and amortization   asset retirement obligation    production    transportation    taxes other than income    general and administrative    stock compensation    other operating  net    gain on derivative instruments   total operating costs and expenses not including gas gathering  marketing and processing costs  or income tax expense increased to million in compared to million in dd a was the largest component of the increase between periods 
dd a equaled million in compared to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the increase stems from replacement costs for reserves added being higher than costs of reserves produced 
service costs to drill and complete wells have been increasing and we are drilling deeper and more complex wells 
production costs rose million from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in we have experienced higher direct labor cost  higher third party field service costs  increased electricity rates and greater water disposal costs 
transportation costs increased from million in to million in the increase is the result of higher sales volumes and that expiring contracts are being renewed with increased current market rates 
general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in the increase between periods is due to an expansion of staff  higher average salaries  higher employee benefit costs  and increased legal representation costs 
in  the increase in other operating  net to million from million was primarily related to resolution of and accruals related to title and royalty issues 
another component of change in total operating costs and expenses between and stems from the million derivative fair value gain we recognized in this gain was associated with price risk management contracts that were not designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts all expired on december  other income and expense interest expense increased by million  or  primarily because of a increase in our total debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 
capitalized interest decreased by million mainly because we are carrying less value associated with unproved properties than we were in we also had a gain in on the early extinguishment of debt arising from redemption of our million face value of old senior unsecured notes 
we replaced the old notes with new ten year  senior unsecured notes 
other  net decreased from million of income in to million of income in components consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees  gain or loss on sale of inventory and interest income 
the decrease from to is due primarily to the liquidation of the company s investment in the company s limited partnership affiliates  teal hunter lp and mallard hunter lp excess distributions of million from this liquidation were recorded during in we received an additional distribution from this liquidation in the amount of million 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for tax expense equaled a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of and in and  respectively 
included in the income tax expense of million was a current tax expense of million 
results of operations compared to our financial and operating results for include the operating results of properties acquired in the magnum hunter merger beginning june  net income for the year was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in the change in net income results from the effect of changes in revenues and costs  as discussed further 
for the years ended december  percent change between price volume analysis oil and gas sales price volume variance in thousands or as indicated gas sales     oil sales     total oil and gas sales    total gas volume mcf gas volume mmcf per day average gas price per mcf total oil volume thousand barrels oil volume barrels per day   average oil price per barrel oil and gas sales for the year totaled billion  compared to billion for the million increase in sales between the two periods results from million related to higher production volumes  offset by a decrease of million resulting from lower commodity prices 
sales benefited from higher production volumes 
average daily gas production rose mmcf in to mmcf from mmcf in  resulting in million of incremental revenues 
oil volumes averaged  barrels per day for  compared to  barrels per day in  resulting in increased revenues of million 
the increase in sales volumes between the periods of and is due to the inclusion of magnum hunter operations beginning june  date of acquisition and positive drilling results during and production volumes in the gulf of mexico and along the texas and louisiana gulf coast area were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of as a result of hurricanes 
it is estimated to have negatively impacted fourth quarter production by to mmcf equivalent per day 
these volumes were brought back online throughout  and by the fourth quarter of less than one mmcf equivalent per day was shut in from the hurricane activity 
no oil and gas reserves have been lost as a result of the storms and the majority of associated repair costs will be covered by insurance 
realized gas prices averaged per mcf for  compared to per mcf for this change decreased sales by million between the two periods 
realized oil prices  however  averaged per barrel for  compared to per barrel for the increase in sales between periods resulting from this improvement in oil prices totaled million 
changes in realized prices were the direct result of overall market conditions 
for the years ended december  gas gathering  processing and marketing in thousands gas gathering and processing revenues   gas gathering and processing costs   gas gathering and processing margin   gas marketing revenues  net of related costs   we sometimes transport  process and market third party gas that is associated with our gas 
in  third party gas gathering and processing contributed million of pre tax cash operating margin revenues less direct cash expenses versus million in our gas marketing margin revenues less purchases increased to million in from million in increases in net margins from gas gathering  processing and marketing activities are the direct result of increased volumes and overall market conditions 
for the years ended december  variance between operating costs and expenses in thousands depreciation  depletion and amortization   asset retirement obligation    production    transportation    taxes other than income    general and administrative    stock compensation    other operating  net    gain loss on derivative instruments   total operating costs and expenses not including gas gathering  marketing and processing costs  or income tax expense were million in compared to million in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a was the largest component of the increase between periods 
dd a equaled million in compared to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the increase stems from higher costs for reserves added during and service costs to drill and complete wells have been increasing 
that along with certain high cost dry holes in our gulf coast and gulf of mexico regions have influenced our per unit rates  even though overall drilling success rates have remained high 
asset retirement obligation increased million from million in to million in the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
oil and gas producing companies incur this liability which includes costs related to the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment  and site restorations  upon acquiring or drilling a successful well 
since the liability has increased million from million in to million in production costs rose million from million 
per mcfe in to million per mcfe in the higher costs in resulted from higher field operating expenses from an expanded number and type of properties  higher maintenance costs and increased insurance costs due to past hurricanes 
additional workover maintenance projects were implemented in  totaling million per mcfe compared to million per mcfe in transportation costs increased from million in to million in the increase is the result of higher sales volumes and that expiring contracts are being renewed with increased current market rates 
taxes other than income were million greater  rising from million in to million in the increase between periods resulted from increases in oil and gas sales stemming from higher production volumes and oil prices 
general and administrative g a expenses increased million from million in to million in the increase between periods is due to an expansion of staff and higher employee benefit costs 
stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock option awards 
stock compensation increased from million in to million in other operating  net decreased from million in to million in these expenses in consisted primarily of million of costs associated with the magnum hunter merger 
of this million  million is due to the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock units resulting from change of control provisions under our stock incentive plan becoming effective due to the magnum hunter merger 
the remaining million consists of million of general integration costs  million for retention bonuses  and million of related financing costs 
in addition to merger costs  expenses also included a mediated million litigation settlement pertaining to post production deductions on properties operated by cimarex 
other expense for included million of litigation settlements pertaining primarily to resolution of oil and gas property title issues 
another component of change in total operating costs and expenses for and was the gain and loss on derivative instruments 
in connection with the magnum hunter merger  cimarex recognized a million liability associated with magnum hunter s existing commodity derivatives at the merger date june  
these derivative instruments were not designated for hedge accounting treatment 
as a result  cimarex recognized net gains for the year of million and net losses for of million  respectively 
activity includes both non cash mark to market derivative gains and losses as well as cash settlements 
cash payments related to these contracts that settled in and totaled million and million  respectively 
these contracts expired december  other income and expense net interest expense in totaled million  comprised of million of interest expense  offset by million of capitalized interest and million of amortization of fair value of debt 
we capitalize interest related to borrowings associated with costs incurred to bring properties under development  not being amortized  to their intended use 
this has decreased from million of net interest expense in  which was comprised of million of interest expense  offset by million of capitalized interest and million of amortization of fair value of debt 
the increases in the components of the net interest amount results from amounts associated with the debt assumed in the magnum hunter merger and an increase in costs incurred to bring properties under development  not being amortized  to their intended use 
prior to the magnum hunter merger  cimarex had no outstanding debt 
other  net increased from million of income in to million of income in the components of this other income net of other expenses consist of miscellaneous items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees 
the large increase from to is due primarily to distribution received in excess of our investment in the company s limited partnership affiliates  teal hunter lp and mallard hunter lp these partnerships sold all of their interest in oil and gas properties during cimarex s investments in these partnerships had been reflected in other assets  net 
net sales consideration received via distributions from the partnerships equaled million  which are in excess of the company s investment balance in the partnerships 
the excess distributions of million have been recorded in other income for income tax expense income tax expense totaled million for versus million for tax expense equaled a combined federal and state effective income tax rate of and in and  respectively 
included in the income tax expense of million is a current benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow from operating activities  occasional property sales  borrowings under our bank credit facility and public offerings of debt securities 
our primary uses of funds are exploration and development  property acquisitions  common stock dividends and occasional share repurchases 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow provided by operating activities 
we believe that our cash flow from operating activities and other capital resources will be adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures 
analysis of cash flow changes cash flow provided by operating activities for was million  compared to million for and million for the increase from to resulted primarily from higher gas prices  higher oil prices and increased oil production 
the increase from to resulted primarily from higher production and from higher oil prices 
our production volumes were higher in versus because we owned the magnum hunter properties for a full year versus seven months in cash flow used in investing activities for was million  compared to billion for and million for changes in the cash flow used in investing activities are generally the result of changes in our exploration and development programs  acquisitions and property sales 
the decrease from to was mostly caused by increased proceeds from property sales 
we sold million of properties in versus million in the increase from to resulted primarily from an increase in exploration and development expenditures 
net cash flow used in financing activities in was million versus million provided in two significant uses were for share repurchases of million and million for dividends 
proceeds from our may issuance of million of ten year  senior unsecured notes were used to redeem our old notes and reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
cash flow provided by financing activities in was million versus million used in the cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the borrowing of million on our credit facility 
the cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from the payment of debt including million of capital lease debt assumed in the magnum hunter acquisition  offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock from stock option exercises 
capital expenditures the following table sets forth certain historical information regarding capitalized expenditures by us in our oil and gas acquisition  exploration  and development activities in thousands for years ended december  acquisitions proved    unproved   exploration and development land seismic    exploration    development    property sales property acquisitions in and primarily relate to various producing properties and exploratory nonproducing leases 
the acquisitions in relate primarily to the purchase of magnum hunter 
we have experienced significant service and material cost inflation over the past three years 
we are starting to see a flattening of drilling and services costs and expect to see this remain dependent upon commodity prices 
our exploration and development expenditures decreased six percent in compared to the decrease in resulted primarily from a decrease in exploration activity in the gulf of mexico 
exploration and development expenditures increased in compared to the increase in resulted from a larger exploration and development program 
we drilled gross wells in compared to gross wells in we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with environmental and safety regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  nor are we aware of any pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact 
our exploration and development drilling program is discussed in exploration and development activity overview under item of this form k 
financial condition total assets increased by billion in from billion at the beginning of the year to reach billion by year end 
our net oil and gas assets increased by billion  primarily because of our drilling program  and our cash position increased by million as a result of property sales that closed during december 
as of december   stockholders equity totaled billion  up from billion at december  the increase resulted primarily from net income of million 
dividends in december  the board of directors declared the company s first quarterly cash dividend of 
per share payable to shareholders 
a 
per share dividend has been authorized in every quarter since then 
on december  the board of directors increased the regular cash dividend on our common stock from to per common share 
common stock repurchase program in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million shares of common stock 
during we repurchased a total of  shares at an average purchase price of 
cumulative purchases through december  total  shares at an average price of 
working capital working capital increased million from year end to million at year end working capital increased primarily because of the following 
we closed on million of property sales in december which allowed us to pay off our remaining bank debt and increase our cash position by million compared to year end other current assets increased by million  primarily due to cash advances paid for construction of a gas processing facility adjacent to our riley ridge field development project in wyoming 
these working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in revenue payable of million due to increased production and prices and an increase in other accrued expenses of million due to having taxable income in the current year and an increase in cash advances from partners 
our receivables are a major component of our working capital and are made up of a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
the collection of receivables during the period presented has been timely 
historically  losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 
financing debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands december  bank debt  notes due face value   notes due  floating rate convertible notes due face value  total long term debt   fair market value at june  date of acquisition of magnum hunter equaled million 
the subsequent noted balances represent the fair market value at date of acquisition less amortization of the premium of fair market value over face value 
fair market value at june  equaled million 
the subsequent noted balances represent the fair market value at date of acquisition less amortization of the premium of fair market value over face value 
our revolving credit facility provides for million of long term committed credit 
the facility is scheduled to mature on july  and is secured by mortgages on certain oil and gas properties and the stock of certain wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we had outstanding letters of credit for approximately million posted against the borrowing base  leaving an unused borrowing amount of approximately million 
the credit facility agreement contains both financial and non financial covenants  including restricting our cash investments to cash equivalent investments as defined under the agreement 
we noted in early december that an investment of million in a money market fund was not in compliance with our covenants 
we then obtained waivers from our lenders for the related investments and amended the definition of cash equivalent investments 
we are in compliance with the amended covenants and do not view them as materially restrictive 
the notes assumed in the magnum hunter merger were redeemed on may  at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus million of accrued interest for a total redemption value of million 
we recognized a gain on the early extinguishment of this debt of million which is reflected on the income statement under other income and expense 
also in may we sold million of new senior unsecured notes that will mature may  the notes were sold to the public at par 
net proceeds from the sale were used to redeem the notes and reduce borrowings under our credit facility 
interest on the new notes is payable may and november of each year 
the first interest payment was made on november  the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on and after may  at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount plus accrued interest  if any  thereon to the date of redemption 
year percentage and thereafter at any time prior to may   we may redeem up to of the original principal amount of the notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings of our shares of common stock at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
at any time prior to may   we may also redeem all  but not part  of the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a make whole premium 
if a specified change of control occurs  subject to certain conditions  we must make an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase 
the floating rate convertible senior notes were assumed in the magnum hunter merger and mature on december  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate equal to three month libor  reset quarterly 
on december   the interest rate was 
holders of the convertible notes may surrender their notes for conversion into a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  including if the price of our common stock has been trading above the fixed conversion price of per share 
on december   the closing price of our common stock traded on the new york stock exchange was 
there is not an observable market for the notes 
based on an average common stock price of  management estimates the fair value of the notes at december  was approximately million or  per bond 
in addition to the holders right to redeem the notes if our common stock price is above the conversion price  the holders also have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued interest on december    and the indenture agreement also provides us with an option to redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount and shares for the value of the convertible feature plus accrued interest anytime after december  contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt   fixed rate interest payments    operating leases      drilling commitments   gas processing facility   asset retirement obligation   other liabilities   see item a interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had committed to construction of a gas processing facility adjacent to our riley ridge gas field in sublette county  wyoming 
the total estimated remaining cost of the facility is million  of which million is subject to a construction contract for the facility 
pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement with our partners in this project  we will be reimbursed by them for approximately of all costs related to the facility 
we have excluded the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
at december   we had a firm sales contract to deliver approximately one bcf of natural gas over the next three months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment may fluctuate due to either price volatility or volumes delivered 
however  we do not anticipate that a financial commitment will be due 
we have other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business  none of which are individually material 
in aggregate these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  of approximately million 
all of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing bank credit facility will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and exploration and development activities 
outlook our exploration and development expenditures program for are projected to range from billion to billion 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our planned operations  we believe our projected program is likely to occur 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts warrant pursuit of the projects 
approximately of the expenditures will be in the mid continent area  in the permian basin  in the gulf coast area  and in our other areas 
production estimates for range from to mmcfe per day 
revenues from production will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil 
prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices being different than they were in is high 
costs of operations on a per mcfe basis for are currently estimated as follows production expense transportation expense dd a and asset retirement obligation general and administrative production taxes of oil and gas revenue critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve significant judgments and discuss the selection and development of these policies and estimates with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
estimations of proved undeveloped reserves can be subject to an even greater possibility of revision 
at year end  percent of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped 
of these proved undeveloped reserves  percent are related to a project in wyoming 
our reserve engineers review and revise our reserve estimates annually 
additionally  we annually engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our proved reserve estimates associated with at least of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
for depletion purposes  reserve quantities are adjusted at interim quarterly periods for the estimated impact of additions  dispositions and price changes 
changes in reserve quantities cause corresponding changes in depletion expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision 
it is also possible that a full cost ceiling limitation charge could occur in the period of the revision 
the following table presents information regarding reserve revisions largely resulting from items we do not control  such as revisions due to price  and other revisions resulting from better information due to production history  well performance and changes in production costs 
years ended december  bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves revisions resulting from price changes other changes in estimates total non price related revisions added bcfe over the three year period  comprising percent of total reserves added over the period of  bcfe 
an bcfe increase resulted from higher prices 
see note  supplemental oil and gas disclosures for additional reserve data 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized in earnings unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to our full cost pool 
at the end of each quarter  we make a full cost ceiling limitation calculation  whereby net capitalized costs related to proved properties less associated deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value discounted at ten percent of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
future net revenues used in the calculation of the full cost ceiling limitation are determined based on current oil and gas prices and are adjusted for designated cash flow hedges 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or oil and gas prices will cause corresponding changes to the amount of full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
however  if commodity prices increase after period end and before issuance of the financial statements  these higher commodity prices will be used to determine if the capital costs are in fact impaired as of the end of the period 
goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually  and more often if volatility in oil and gas prices or other circumstances warrant 
the impairment assessment requires us to make estimates regarding the fair value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value is based on numerous factors  including future net cash flows of our estimates of proved reserves as well as the fair value of our nonproducing leases and other assets and liabilities 
if our carrying amount for goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value  then a measurement of the loss must be performed and any deficiency is recorded as an impairment 
to date  no related impairment has been recorded but we cannot predict when or if goodwill may be impaired in the future 
impairment charges may occur if we are unable to replace the value of our depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  materially lower oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of our company 
derivatives we determine the fair value of derivative contracts based on the stated contract prices and current and projected market prices at the determination date discounted to reflect the time value of money until settlement 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge for accounting treatment purposes 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in costs and expenses associated with operating income in our consolidated statements of operations 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in the fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is settled 
changes in the fair value of the hedge resulting from ineffectiveness are recognized currently as unrealized gains or losses in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses upon settlement of the cash flow hedges will be recognized in gas revenues in the period the contracts are settled 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and item a of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
in the normal course of business we have various litigation related matters and associated accruals 
though some of the related claims may be significant  the resolution of them we believe  individually or in aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our company 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we revised our existing estimated asset retirement obligation by million  or approximately one percent of the asset retirement obligation at december   due to changes in the various related attributes 
over the past three years  revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation averaged approximately of the asset retirement obligation at the beginning of the year 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two new statements 
fasb statement r  business combinations  requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value 
the statement redefines various aspects related to the accounting for a business combination by now applying the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method 
fasb statement  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  requires noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
both statements are effective for periods beginning on or after december   and earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of either statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and value of our short term investments 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
price fluctuations our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable see risk factors in item 
currently  we are largely accepting the volatility risk that the change in prices presents 
none of our future oil production is subject to hedging 
with regard to our future natural gas production  based on contracts currently in place  we have mmbtu per day of gas production in that is subject to zero cost collars with weighted average floor and ceiling prices of to 
this amount represents approximately of our estimated gas production eight percent of our total mcfe production 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
mid continent gas would have to be above the ceiling for us to have any downside risk 
at december   the weighted average mid continent prices for the contracts approximated 
these contracts are not expected to have a material effect on our realized gas prices for see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt outstanding of million 
of this amount  million is senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of and will mature on may  the remaining debt is million of unsecured convertible senior notes face value that mature on december  these convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to three month libor  reset quarterly 
the book value of our debt approximates the current fair value 
we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because as of december  about of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates 
a increase in the three month libor rate would increase annual interest expense by million 
this sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding debt 
market value of investments we currently have million invested in an asset back securities fund 
we expect to liquidate our investment in this fund within the next months 
a five percent change in these investments market value would have a million impact on our investments
