overview we are a multi business medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive surgical products  many of which are based on our patented coblation technology 
we currently market minimally invasive surgical products across three core business units arthrocare sports medicine  arthrocare spine  and arthrocare ear  nose and throat  or ent but also have developed  manufactured and marketed coblation based and complementary products for application in neurology  cosmetic surgery  urology and gynecology  with research continuing in additional areas 
in each of our core business units we are focused on driving the application of enabling technologies  primarily for plasma based soft tissue removal  and increasing the number of minimally invasive procedures being performed 
in december  we introduced our arthroscopy system commercially in the united states and have derived a significant portion of our sales from this system 
our strategy includes placing controller units  which enable use of our disposable coblation products  at substantial discounts or placing controllers at customer sites at no cost in order to generate future disposable product revenue 
our strategy also includes applying our patented coblation technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical markets  including the products we have introduced in the fields of spinal surgery  neurosurgery  gynecology  urology  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  cardiology and general surgery 
we cannot be sure that any of our clinical studies in other fields will lead to k applications or that the applications will be cleared by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the products  if cleared for marketing  will ever achieve commercial acceptance 
in may  we announced that we had entered the ear  nose and throat market and had formed a business unit called entec to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in september  we announced that we had entered the spinal surgery market 
in february  we announced that we were expanding our marketing efforts for our spinal surgery system to specifically address selected applications in neurosurgery 
we are marketing and selling our spinal surgery products through a network of independent distributors and direct sales representatives supported by regional managers worldwide 
in january  we acquired mda and its majority owned subsidiary  parallax  a business focused on the treatment of vertebral compression fractures 
in november  we acquired opus medical  a business focused on soft tissue to bone repair systems  including systems for the treatment of rotator cuff injuries 
in august  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of applied therapeutics  inc  or ati  a maker of sinus surgery treatment products 
we have received k clearance from the fda to market several of our products and several of our products are ce marked  which is a requirement to sell our products in most of western europe 
specifically  we have received k clearance from the fda to market our coblation based arthroscopic surgery system  or arthroscopic system  for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee  shoulder  ankle  elbow  wrist and hip 
in addition  our arthroscopic system is ce marked for use in arthroscopic surgery 
we have also received k clearances in the united states and a ce mark in europe to market and sell our coblation based spinal surgery system for spinal surgery and neurosurgery 
we have received k clearance and a ce mark to market our interventional therapy devices for percutaneous  intraoperative and spinal procedures 
our ent surgery system has received k clearances from the fda and a ce mark for use in general head  neck  oral and sinus surgery procedures  including tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy  turbinate reduction to relieve nasal obstruction  and soft tissue removal to treat snoring 
the fda also has cleared our cosmetic surgery system for general dermatologic procedures and skin resurfacing in connection with wrinkle reduction procedures 
in addition  the cosmetic surgery system has received a ce mark 
we also have received k clearance from the fda  and applied for a ce mark  to market products based on our coblation technology for use in urology  gynecology  plastic and reconstructive surgery  orthopedic surgery and general surgery 
many of arthrocare s products are leading edge technologies which have not yet received routine coverage decisions from insurance companies and other payers 
as a result  reimbursement may be dependent on case by case decisions from various private third party payers 
in  we established a new subsidiary  device reimbursement services  to provide certain of the devices we sell in exchange for an assignment of the right to bill for such devices 
additionally  in december we acquired another third party billing and reimbursement service provider  discocare  inc in addition  we have adopted the arthrocare corporation health care compliance program  implementing the key elements of a model health care compliance plan developed by the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services  or oig  which oversees compliance with applicable federal laws in connection with the payment for products by government funded programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab under sab  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  the criteria are met upon shipment of the company s products 
for amounts due from third party payors  revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due for devices utilized with allowances determined using historical collection amounts for each type of payor 
estimated allowances are adjusted to actual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
we evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated allowance percentages each month historical allowance trends based on actual claims paid by third party payors  consideration and analysis of changes in payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact allowances 
in certain cases  at the customer s request  we will enter into bill and hold transactions whereby title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  but the product does not ship until a specified later date 
revenue on such transactions is recognized only after arthrocare has met all conditions for bill and hold transactions set forth in sab  specifically that arthrocare has no further performance obligations  that the product is complete and ready for shipment  and that a fixed schedule for delivery of the product is set 
as of december   and  respectively  there were no undelivered bill and hold transactions 
revenue is reported net of a provision for estimated product returns 
we recognize license fees and other revenue over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
royalties are recognized as earned  generally based on the licensees product shipments 
the items are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues in the accompanying statements of operations 
amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling costs have also been classified as royalties  fees and other revenues and related costs are classified as costs of product sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts 
the company regularly reviews the allowance  considering such factors as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  the age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses associated with accounts receivable 
inventory allowance inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
we record an allowance against our inventory value to the extent we believe that demand for certain inventory items has decreased or if certain inventory items have become obsolete 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
business combinations accounting for our business acquisitions requires extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price between net tangible assets  in process research and development  other identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the company accounts for business combinations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or fas as of december   we had recorded goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million  net of accumulated amortization 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of each reporting unit using discounted cash flow valuation models 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value in fiscal  indicating the underlying goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired as of december  accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or more often when impairment indicators are present 
there are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results and materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
therefore  the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of each asset 
we monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period 
under statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives must be tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
to date  no events or circumstances have been noted that would indicate the potential for impairment of our intangible assets 
in connection with the ati acquisition  we made an estimate of million related to the valuation of purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  projects 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects which have no alternative future use  including those for which the related products have not reached technological feasibility or have not received regulatory approval 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition  in accordance with accepted valuation methods  and includes consideration of the assessed risk of the project not being developed to a stage of commercial feasibility 
on december   we acquired a third party billing and reimbursement service provider  discocare  inc since  discocare has been providing surgical devices to facilities  generally at no charge in exchange for the right to bill for such device 
arthrocare paid million in cash  net of acquisition costs paid and cash acquired with the potential for future earnouts based on achievement of contractually specified milestones 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination  we evaluated the purchase as a multiple element contract to separately account for settlement of the preexisting relationship and for the acquisition 
based on our analysis  there was no gain or loss required to be recognized for settling the preexisting relationship 
therefore  the entire purchase price was allocated to the net assets of discocare based on fair market value as of the date of acquisition  primarily accounts receivable  inventory  identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed with the balance applied to goodwill 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
in determining loss contingencies  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accrual estimates should be adjusted 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in addition  we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in generally accepted accounting principles 
while we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  in accordance with fin  paragraph  we have decided to classify interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a million increase in liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million  of which million  if recognized  would result in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
the company recorded an increase in its unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million for the year ended december  interest and penalties were immaterial as of december  and are included in the unrecognized tax benefits 
the company is subject to audit by the internal revenue service and california franchise tax board for the years through and by the texas state comptroller for the years and as the company has operations in most other us states  other state tax authorities may assess deficiencies related to prior year activities  however  the years open to assessment vary with each state 
the company also files income tax returns for non us jurisdictions  the most significant of which are the uk  sweden  and germany 
the years open to adjustment for the uk and germany are through the years open to adjustment for sweden are through stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  including employee stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  or espp  based on estimated grant date fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized under fas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense relating to restricted stock awards and non employee stock options for the year ended december  was million 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized during the year ended december  see note  stockholders equity  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
upon adoption of fas r  we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model  as we had previously used for the purpose of disclosing pro forma financial information 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behavior 
the weighted average fair value of stock awards  excluding restricted stock  granted for the year ended december  was per share and per share for the espp  using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  options espp expected term in years expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends the expected term assumption for options was determined based on historical data  adjusted for the recent reduction of the contractual life for options from to seven years 
the expected volatility was determined using a blend of implied volatility and historical volatility over the expected term  which we consider a better indictor of expected volatility than using only historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the company s awards 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures at a rate of percent 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience but actual forfeitures could differ materially and result in volatility in our stock based compensation expense amounts 
overview of financial results total revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of percent compared to the year ended december  the increase was driven by the combined performance of all business units 
international product sales represented approximately percent of net product sales for the year 
no single customer accounted for more than percent of our net product sales for the year ended december  total operating expenses were approximately million for  compared to million in this million increase was driven by a combination of factors approximately million represents increased salaries  commissions and other employee related expenses due to increased headcount  million relates to additional commissions and fees related to increased sales volume and new sales agency agreements  million is attributable to increased clinical testing  marketing and promotions related to new product lines  and million relates to a net increase in legal  accounting and other outside consulting costs 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance at december  was million  an increase of approximately million from december  results of operations year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands revenues product sales royalties  fees and other total revenues cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets acquired in process research and development costs total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income revenues product sales consist principally of sales of disposable devices 
product sales for fiscal were million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
product sales by product market for the periods shown were as follows dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  sports medicine ent spine coblation technology total product sales product sales by geography for the periods shown were as follows dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  americas united kingdom germany rest of world total product sales our sustained increase in direct sales presence has continued to have a positive effect on product sales since inception  as has the execution of our strategic plan to build market share through promotional programs of controller placements  commercialization of our technology in fields outside of arthroscopy  and the introduction of new products designed to address surgical procedures that have traditionally been difficult to perform 
additionally  our acquisitions of atlantech  parallax  ati and opus medical product lines have continued to have a positive effect on sales growth 
we anticipate that disposable device sales will remain a key component of our product sales in the near future 
based upon the estimated number of arthroscopic procedures performed each year  we believe that knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market  while shoulder procedures represent the fastest growing segment 
to achieve increasing disposable device sales in arthroscopy over time  we believe we must continue to penetrate the market in knee procedures  expand physicians education with respect to coblation technology  and continue to work on new product development efforts specifically for knee applications 
we believe that  in our more than ten years of product shipments  we have penetrated to percent of the facilities that perform arthroscopic procedures in the united states 
we believe that approximately percent of our arthroscopy product sales are being generated by the sale of disposables for use in knee procedures 
we expect our sales to continue to be strong in  as we continue to increase our presence in europe and the south pacific and benefit from the integration of our acquisitions 
royalties  fees  and other revenues consist mainly of revenue from the licensing of our products and technology  plus shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
royalties  fees  and other revenues increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively  as a result of increased sales of our products and growth in the markets for which we receive royalties 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consist of manufacturing costs  material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs 
additionally  cost of product sales includes amortization of controller unit placements under a program whereby we maintain ownership of controller units shipped to customers  with the costs being capitalized and amortized into cost of product sales over the useful life of the controller unit 
cost of product sales was million  or percent of total revenues  for  compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in gross product margin as a percentage of sales increased to percent in from percent in and percent in the increase in gross product margin percentage for the year ended december  compared to the same period in is primarily a result of increased manufacturing efficiencies  a rise in average selling prices  and increased sales volume associated with our higher gross margin products 
the favorable increase in gross product margin percentage in as compared to is primarily due to an increase in average selling prices accompanied by a decrease in component costs 
amortization of controllers was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
controller amortization represented percent of product sales in this is compared to and  when controller amortization represented percent and percent of product sales  respectively 
the decrease as a percent of cost of sales for is due to lower controller placements with existing customers in anticipation of our new controller launched in the first quarter of cost of product sales for the year ended december  includes million of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options 
in  cost of product sales included million of stock based compensation expense 
we expect gross margin to continue to increase as we continue to increase our average selling prices and improve operating efficiencies 
operating expenses research and development expense increased in to million  or percent of total revenues  from million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in the absolute dollar increase in research and development expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to million in increased clinical testing supplies and services associated with our new products and million in additional employee compensation due to increased research and development headcount to support new product development initiatives 
the increase in research and development costs in as compared to is primarily due to million in increased stock compensation expense due to our adoption of fas r  along with a continued investment in our coblation based products and in the mda product line  resulting in an increase of million in consulting and outside service costs and million in patent related and product development charges 
we expect research and development expenses to increase through continued expenditures on new product development  regulatory affairs  clinical studies and patents 
we expect these expenses as a percentage of product sales to remain essentially flat 
sales and marketing expense increased to million  or percent of total revenues  in from million  or percent of total revenues  in  and from million  or percent of total revenues  in the increase for compared to related primarily to million in additional commissions and fees due to increased sales volume and new sales agency agreements  million in additional salaries and employee related expenses and million in additional commissions associated with increased sales and marketing headcount  and million in additional marketing costs related to trade shows  samples and demonstrations to promote new product lines 
increased expenses in as compared to related primarily to million in training and promotion costs  million in additional compensation and related expenses associated with our increased direct sales force  million in stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of fas r  and million in settlement fees associated with the settlement and license agreement between arthrocare and marctec  llc formerly bonutti ip  llc 
we anticipate that sales and marketing spending will continue to increase as a result of the expansion of our distribution capabilities to address the spinal surgery and ear  nose and throat markets  higher dealer commissions from increased sales  the additional cost of penetrating international markets  higher promotional  demonstration and sample expenses  and additional investments in the sales  marketing and support staff necessary to commercialize and market future products 
this increase will be partially offset by a reduction in service fees previously paid to discocare which we acquired on december general and administrative expense increased in absolute dollars to million  or percent of total revenues  in  from million  or percent of total revenues  in and million  or percent of total revenues  in the absolute dollar increase is primarily due to a million net increase in legal  accounting and other outside service costs and a million increase in employee related expenses associated with increased headcount in administrative functions 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily due to a net increase of million in legal  accounting and other outside services costs  million of stock based compensation expense associated with our adoption of fas r  and million of additional compensation and related expenses associated with increasing our headcount in our accounting and other administrative functions 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will remain essentially flat as a percentage of total revenues during due to continued investments in our infrastructure to support further revenue growth 
amortization of intangible assets was million  or percent of total revenues  in  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in  and million  or percent of total revenues  in the decrease as a percentage of total revenues over the last two years is primarily due to fewer acquisitions of intangible assets during periods of increasing revenues each year since acquired in process research and development costs ipr d were not incurred during the years ended december  or during the third quarter of we incurred million of acquired in process research and development costs in connection with the research and development efforts acquired in our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ati 
prior to the acquisition  we did not have a comparable product under development 
this expense related to the development of technology for arresting bleeding that had not yet reached technological feasibility at ati and had no alternative future use 
as of december   the research and development of this technology was completed and the stammberger foam product  which utilizes this technology  was commercialized for use in ent procedures 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net was a net benefit of million in compared to a net expense of million in and a net expense of million in the million increase in net interest income in is primarily attributable to the funding of our operations through operating cash flows for the majority of as opposed to borrowing against our credit facility 
the million decrease in expense in was primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains in  whereas in we had foreign exchange losses 
we expect to see a net interest expense in as a result of borrowing million against our credit facility in december income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million for  compared to million for and million for the effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in the yearly improvement in our tax rate from to is primarily due to the continued expansion of business activities in our costa rica operations and tax credits for research and development activities 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in working capital  compared to million at december  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
our short term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds 
cash generated by operating activities in was million  as compared to million in and million in the cash generated in was primarily attributable to million of net income  million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation  partially offset by million in increased accounts receivable and million in increased inventory 
the cash generated in was primarily attributable to million of net income and non cash items such as million of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of million  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and million in increased inventory 
the cash generated in was primarily attributable to million in net income adjusted for non cash items  including million of depreciation and amortization and million in income tax benefits related to employee stock options  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to million for purchases of intangible assets and other purchase business combinations  million for purchases of property and equipment  and million in payments to ati shareholders in satisfaction of acquisition related contractual contingencies  partially offset by million in sales of available for sale securities 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to a million payment to former opus medical shareholders  million for the purchase of property and equipment  and million for the purchase of available for sale securities  partially offset by million of sales of available for sale securities 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to the million payment made for the purchase of ati s assets in august  accompanied by million associated with the capitalization of controllers and million in fixed asset investments  offset by net sales of million in available for sale securities 
the fair value of our investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in cash used in financing activities in cash provided by financing activities in was due primarily to million in proceeds from borrowings against our revolving line of credit  million of proceeds from stock option purchases  and million in tax benefits related to stock option expenses  partially offset by million used for the purchase of shares of our common stock on the open market 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to million of proceeds from stock option purchases and a million tax benefit related to the stock option expenses 
cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to million of loan repayments  partially offset by million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
on january   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks collectively  the lenders 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we may borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit from the named lenders at the lead lender s prime rate or the british bankers association libor rate  plus a spread 
the spread over the prime rate or libor rate is determined by the company s leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
in december  in connection with our purchase of shares of our common stock on the open market  we borrowed million against the line of credit 
at december   we had million in outstanding balances under the credit agreement and the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit agreement was percent 
the credit agreement has a five year maturity and includes additional terms under which we may request an increase of up to million in commitments from the lenders  as business needs dictate 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants that specify minimum or maximum financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at december  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  expensing of stock options  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table aggregates all material contractual obligations and commercial commitments that affected our financial condition and liquidity as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments with suppliers total represents agreements to purchase products that are enforceable  legally binding and specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and the approximate timing of the payments 
we believe that the above described credit and term facilities  in addition to cash generated from operations  as well as our existing cash balances and short term investments  will be sufficient to fund our operations through fiscal year and in the near future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our success in commercializing our products  development and commercialization of products in fields other than arthroscopy  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  obtaining and enforcing patents important to our business  the status of regulatory approvals and competition
