item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as limited operating and sales history  the uncertainty of market acceptance of our product  dependence on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement  effectiveness and safety of our product over the long term  our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental clearances or approvals to market our product  our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology  our ability to manage our expansion or any acquisition  our dependence on suppliers intense competition in the medical device industry  the inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls and other factors referenced in this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market the essure permanent birth control system  an innovative and proprietary medical device for women that was approved for marketing in the united states in november by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
the essure system uses a soft and flexible micro insert that is delivered into a woman s fallopian tubes to provide permanent birth control by causing a benign tissue in growth that blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure micro insert and the subsequent tissue growth prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes and therefore prevents fertilization 
the essure procedure the essure procedure is typically performed as an outpatient procedure and is intended to be a less invasive and a less costly alternative to tubal ligation  the leading form of birth control in the united states and worldwide 
laparoscopic tubal ligation and tubal ligation by laparotomy typically involve abdominal incisions and or punctures  general or regional anesthesia  four to ten days of normal recovery time and the risks associated with an incisional procedure 
the essure procedure does not require cutting or penetrating the abdomen  which lowers the likelihood of post operative pain due to the incisions punctures  and it can be performed in an outpatient setting without general or regional anesthesia 
in the pivotal trial of the essure system  the total procedure time averaged minutes  with an average of minutes of hysteroscopic time to place the essure micro insert 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  the essure system is effective without drugs or hormones 
there is a three month waiting period after the procedure during which the woman must use another form of birth control while tissue in growth occurs 
at days following the procedure  us patients complete a follow up examination called a hysterosalpingogram  or hsg  which can determine whether the device was placed successfully and whether the fallopian tubes are occluded 
outside of the us  patients are required to return for a pelvic x ray at three months post procedure with a subsequent hsg if device location on the initial radiographic image appears suspicious 
we believe that the essure system is also an attractive alternative to tubal ligation for physicians  hospitals and payers 
the essure system is a less invasive permanent birth control option for physicians to offer to their patients  hospitals are able to utilize their facilities more cost effectively with the essure procedure compared with tubal ligation  and payers are able to experience cost reductions resulting from the elimination of overhead and procedural costs related to anesthesia and post operative hospital stays associated with tubal ligations 
we also believe the essure system is a viable alternative to other temporary methods of birth control being used when there is no intention of having children in the future 
in addition  payers may also benefit from the reduction of unplanned pregnancies associated with non permanent methods of birth control used by patients who have chosen to avoid the drawbacks of traditional permanent birth control methods but who may elect to use the essure system 
published reports estimate that  tubal ligation procedures are performed each year in the united states 
we intend to tap into this market and establish the essure procedure as the gold standard for permanent birth control 
the essure system is currently being marketed in multiple countries 
in november we received approval from the fda to market the essure system in the united states 
in  we were given approval to affix the ce mark to the essure system  indicating that the essure system is certified for sale throughout the european union  subject to compliance with local regulations such as registration with health ministries and or particular requirements regarding labeling or distribution 
in  the essure permanent birth control system was listed with australia s therapeutic goods administration  which allows us to market and sell the essure system in australia 
in canada  we received clearance from health canada to market the essure system in canada in november in france  the haute autorit de sant lifted in october all the restrictions  thereby putting the essure procedure on an equal footing with tubal ligations 
following this decision  the essure procedure is covered in france for all women  regardless of medical status 
in addition  the ceps in france recommended in november that the reimbursement for the essure device remain at the then current levels of euros for the next years 
we currently have distributors in australia  canada and spain 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of conceptus sas  our distributor in france  and as a result conceptus sas will operate as our wholly owned subsidiary 
as set forth by the agreement and its amendments  the purchase price was determined as times conceptus sas sales revenues for the company s products for the fiscal year  plus  the profits made by conceptus sas during the period beginning january  and ending december   less any dividends distributed by conceptus sas after january   other than the distribution approved by the general meeting of the shareholders of conceptus sas pertaining to the profits for fiscal year  less  if applicable  any clawback amount resulting from the difference between the unitary reimbursement rate the rate established by the french official journal of notice for each essure device  and such clawback will be calculated as follows if the rate is equal or above  no clawback amount will be due by the sellers party to us 
if the rate is equal or above and lower than  the clawback amount shall be equal to  if the rate is equal or above and lower than  the clawback amount shall be equal to  if the rate is equal or above and lower than  the clawback amount shall be equal to  and  if the rate is below  the clawback amount shall be equal to  all amounts expressed in this item include value added tax  or vat 
pursuant to the share purchase agreement  we paid on the closing date million in cash placed in an escrow account  from which million was released to the sellers on the same date 
the amount paid by us constitutes the initial purchase price payment and was based on an estimate of conceptus sas sales revenues for the year prepared in good faith by conceptus sas 
additionally  on february   we entered into an amendment to the share purchase and call option agreement dated january  with conceptus sas and into an amendment to the distribution agreement with conceptus sas  dated january  pursuant to the amendment to the share purchase and call option agreement  we agreed not to exercise the call option to acquire conceptus sas in and agreed to exercise our call option to acquire sas sometime between january  and january  subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions 
pursuant to the amendment to the distribution agreement  conceptus sas agreed to increase the price they pay to us for the essure product 
the difference in price of the revised distribution agreement compared to the previous agreement is being recorded as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the balance of this current liability was million and will be recorded as a reduction of the purchase price of conceptus sas 
we are still evaluating the final purchase price of conceptus sas that will be finalized in the first quarter of effectiveness of the essure system in july  we received approval from the fda to extend effectiveness data on the essure product labeling 
the premarket approval  or pma  supplement filed in late january supports an extension of the effectiveness rate of the essure system to after four years and after five years of follow up  from the previously approved at three years 
the five year effectiveness was demonstrated in a small portion of the women undergoing clinical studies 
five year follow up of all patients in clinical trials is ongoing 
in september  we received approval from the fda to terminate our post approval study with physicians who were newly trained in performing the essure procedure due to the positive placement data obtained 
the purpose of the post approval study  required by the fda as a condition of the november approval of the essure system  was to determine the rate of successful bilateral placements of the essure micro inserts at first attempt with a large number of newly trained physicians who were not part of the previous clinical studies 
although treatment of the total number of patients required by fda had not been completed  the data obtained to date provided us with the opportunity to request that the fda permit an early termination of the study 
because of the fda ruling  the pma supplement submitted in march has been re classified as a final report 
the results of the post approval study demonstrated an improvement in placement rates from those obtained in the pivotal study 
in november  we filed a pma supplement with the fda in order to obtain approval to modify the essure physician and patient labeling to reflect a first procedure bilateral placement rate based on results of the post approval study 
in october  we received such approval from the fda 
in march  we filed a pma supplement with the fda in order to obtain approval for a modified delivery system and micro insert  and new valved introducer 
we received such approval from the fda in june a post approval study is being conducted to investigate the bilateral placement rate at first attempt for the modified delivery system and micro insert  and is expected to be similar for the newest model of the essure system 
penetration we require physicians to be preceptored for between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
as of december   the increase of physicians that have been trained or that are in the process of training has been commensurate with the increase in sales 
the level of sales for the essure system  particularly in this early period of adoption  is highly dependent on the number of physicians trained to perform the procedure 
however  we understand that a strong base of trained physicians does not necessarily correlate to an increase in revenue proportionately 
furthermore  there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant from inception to date 
reimbursement of the essure procedure market acceptance of the essure system depends in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
we believe that physician advocacy of our product will be required to continue to obtain reimbursement 
as of december   we have received positive reimbursement decisions for the essure procedure from most private insurers and from of the medicaid programs in the united states 
we continue to receive positive responses relating to reimbursement  which we believe will help increase the adoption of the essure device by doctors and patients 
we intend to continue our effort to educate payers of the cost effectiveness of our product and to establish further programs to help physicians to navigate reimbursement issues 
as with all healthcare plans  coverage will vary and is dependent upon the individual s specific benefit plan 
effective january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the medicare national unadjusted average payment for hysteroscopic sterilization  the cpt code  is when performed in a hospital and  when performed in a physician s office 
while the newly approved payment for the hospital is valid for the year  the physician schedule will be revisited by june in addition  in the cms final rule for the outpatient prospective payment system or opps  which assigns hospital outpatient reimbursement amounts  the cpt code was assigned a medicare national average of  in  the medicare national average payment for hysteroscopic sterilization in the ambulatory surgery center is  which includes the cost of the implant 
we believe these values are very favorable for the essure procedure and will help in establishing increased utilization of the device amongst doctors 
adoption of the essure system the essure system is a novel product in the contraception market  which is dominated by procedures that are well established among physicians and patients and are routinely taught to new physicians 
as a result  we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our product 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices  partly because of perceived liability risks 
our biggest challenge is to speed up the adoption process to make the essure procedure the standard of care for permanent birth control 
the following discussion summarizes our program in the united states to increase adoption of the essure procedure 
first  we are expanding our sales territories and channels of distribution so as to increase our call frequency on physicians 
during the year ended december   we added a substantial number of sales positions and we are expecting to add more in also  we have included targeting regional distributors of women s gynecology products to our marketing efforts 
among other responsibilities  our sales representatives are attempting to increase penetration and utilization of the essure procedure  as well as to facilitate the movement of the essure procedure to the in office environment 
second  we are attempting to increase patient awareness  so as to increase the number of women that will ask for information about the essure procedure 
in the fourth quarter of we commenced activities for a direct to consumer campaign that will incorporate print media  radio and television advertising 
the programs will launch in specific areas of the country beginning in the first quarter of we hope through these programs to drive patient awareness and increase utilization of the essure procedure 
third  we are focused on obtaining favorable coverage decisions from payers representing the private paying and state paying medicaid systems 
we are also focused on getting the cpt code and payment schedule implemented at all of the payers that have given a coverage decision 
our tactical reimbursement focus is intended to give the physician and his her staff the tools to ensure that claims will ultimately be paid and thereby encourages the physician to continue performing the essure procedure despite reimbursement issues 
this tactical reimbursement team is generally targeting specific accounts with the aim of eventually meeting with all of our accounts so as to provide them with the knowledge of how to file and follow up on claims on a payer by payer basis 
fourth  we intend to continue making labeling improvements to our product as well as physical product enhancements to increase the adoption of the essure procedure 
this may involve working with the various regulatory agencies around the world that regulate the sale and labeling of medical devices to provide updates to claims such as effectiveness and placement rates 
where appropriate  we will make physical improvements to the product for improved manufacturability  for the ease of use by the physician or to improve the clinical performance of our product 
we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we will continue to expend substantial resources in the selling and marketing of the essure system in the united states and abroad 
due to the unpredictable nature of these activities  we do not know whether we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we will continue to be in a net loss position until sufficient revenues can be generated to offset expenses 
critical accounting estimates and policies we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  cash equivalents and marketable securities  warranty obligation  impairment of long lived assets  debt  contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily comprised of the sale of our essure system 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab under this standard  the following four criteria must be met in order to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the four revenue recognition criteria and other revenue related pronouncements are applied to our sales as described in the following paragraphs 
we recognize revenues from our essure system when we ship the device 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the system as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
we do not accept returns of the essure system 
we obtain written authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and the price is not dependent on actual essure procedures performed 
in  we had international distributors in france  spain  australia and canada 
we recognize revenues upon shipment for sales through distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  training and warranty for the sale of the essure device in their respective territories 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange the essure system and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of their ability to resell the product 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant from inception to date 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions shown in note of our notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the estimated life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 
r 
accordingly  during the period ended december   we recorded stock based compensation for shares granted prior to  but not yet vested as of the adoption date based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and therefore  we did not restate previously reported amounts 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventory reserves are recorded when conditions indicate that the selling price may be less than the cost 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
once established  the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis 
reversal of these reserves is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
during the year ended december   we wrote off approximately million of potentially excess and obsolete inventories as a result of the transition to our next generation device 
in the future  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory writedowns may be required and gross margin could be adversely impacted 
as of december   and  our reserves were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  we account for the possibility that certain customers may not pay us by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our increase in sales may result in a higher accounts receivable balance  which may require a higher balance in the allowance 
as of december   and  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately   and  respectively 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at december   all investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   we had no declines in fair value that were determined as other than temporary  however  we may in the future have to record an other than temporary impairment charge with respect to our investments 
warranty obligation we provide for the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change if we change manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractor 
should actual costs differ from historical experience  increases in warranty expense may be required 
warranty reserves as of december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment and the essure license acquired from a patent litigation settlement in see note to consolidated financial statements  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december   and included property and equipment of million  million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million  million and million  respectively 
debt we account for our convertible senior notes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in this regard  our convertible debt and net share settlement feature does not fall under the category of a derivative  and consequently  we classify our long term debt as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
our convertible hedge and our outstanding warrants are accounted as set forth by emerging issues task force  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  through which we record the convertible hedge transaction and the warrants in additional paid in capital 
subsequent changes in fair value of the agreement are not recognized 
in addition  we account for the cost issuance of debt in accordance with accounting principles board  interest on receivables and payables 
consequently  these costs were recognized as an asset and are amortized by periodic charges to income 
we apply the straight line method  which is not materially different to the effective interest method set forth by apb contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we must assess whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
due to our cumulative pre tax losses and the current uncertainty of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our deferred tax assets  was recorded 
results of operations results compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change amount a amount a net sales   gross profit   research and development expenses   selling  general and administrative expenses   net loss   a expressed as a percentage of total net sales net sales the following table summarizes net sales by geographic region years ended december  net sales in thousands   united states of america europe other net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of our customers 
the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization of the essure system worldwide  and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure and higher utilization by trained physicians 
increasing the number of physicians trained is very important because it provides us with a strong referral base within major metropolitan areas we have targeted 
we understand that a strong base of trained physicians does not necessarily correlate to an increase in revenue proportionately 
furthermore  there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant to us from inception to date 
we expect to see higher sales of our essure system in as we continue to increase the number of sales representatives in order to provide even greater depth of physician coverage  which in turn we expect will increase physician utilization and the number of physicians performing the essure procedure 
we will also continue to increase our programs aimed at raising patient awareness of the essure procedure  such as radio  print and television advertising 
additionally  we will see an increase in our international sales with the acquisition of our french subsidiary in january gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in gross profit increased million to million from million in our gross profit percentage was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit increased throughout the year ended december  and was in the fourth quarter of  as compared to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage in was primarily the result of the decrease in costs due to our next generation device  lower manufacturing costs associated with higher unit volume and a domestic price increase instituted during the first quarter of we anticipate gross margins will improve in due to the acquisition of our subsidiary in france and lower per unit costs on higher production volumes 
refer to note  subsequent events of our consolidated financial statements for a description of the acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in research and development expenses reflect clinical expenditures and product development  which are substantially related to the ongoing development and associated regulatory approvals of our technology 
our goal is to continue our product enhancements over the coming years  which are intended to result in improved ease of use and clinical performance 
we expect to identify and hire additional research and development personnel in the future to staff our planned research and development activities  and we expect that these costs will increase as we seek to maintain our leading position in the market for permanent female birth control 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were a result of higher payroll expenditures of million due to the expansion of our us field sales force in  which is meant to provide us additional resources to focus on physician penetration and utilization 
additionally  we incurred direct to consumer campaign expenses of million  which we began to incur direct costs in the fourth quarter of this test market campaign when launched in will involve television  radio and print media and is intended to drive patient awareness of the essure procedure and increase physician utilization 
in  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were also due to higher consulting expenses of million  higher travel expenses of million  higher legal and professional fees and honorarium fees of million  higher taxes and insurance of million and higher stock based compensation of million 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we expect to hire additional sales professionals and to increase patient awareness through our direct to consumer campaign in targeted markets 
other income and expenses interest and other income and expenses of million increased by million in compared to million in the increase is due to higher interest income in due to higher cash volumes during the year as a result of investing the proceeds of our convertible senior note offering  completed in february  at a rate in excess of the coupon rate 
interest income in will depend on the level of our cash balances throughout the year and the fluctuation in interest rates of our investments 
in addition  we expect interest expense to grow in as compared to  due to a full year of interest expense on our outstanding senior convertible notes  which will total million in income taxes at december   we evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
due to our cumulative pre tax losses and the current uncertainty of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million 
results compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change amount a amount a net sales   gross profit   research and development expenses   selling  general and administrative expenses  net loss   a expressed as a percentage of total net sales net sales the following table summarizes net sales by geographic region years ended december  net sales in thousands   united states of america europe other net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of the external customers 
the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization of the essure system worldwide  and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure and higher utilization by trained physicians 
we also instituted a domestic price increase during the first quarter of gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in gross profit increased million to million from million in our gross profit percentage was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit percentage improved throughout the year ended december  and was in the fourth quarter of  as compared to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of the impact of higher volumes on relatively fixed manufacturing costs  lower contractual prices from our third party manufacturer beginning in fiscal year and a domestic price increase instituted during the first quarter of operating expenses research and development expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase results from million increase in stock based compensation due to the application of sfas r and from expenditures related to product development  clinical affairs and regulatory activities 
research and development expenditures fluctuate in relation to product development  clinical affairs and regulatory activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase results from higher payroll expenditures of million due to the expansion of our us field sales force in  which is meant to provide us with more selling time to focus on physician penetration 
additionally  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were a result of million in headcount increases in departments other than sales  million increase in stock based compensation due to the application of fas r  higher travel expenses of million  higher recruiting expenses of million  increase in depreciation and amortization of million and million in marketing programs and campaigns to increase physician education and patient awareness  partially offset by million in lower consulting services  million in lower legal and audit fees and million in lower rent expense 
other income and expenses interest and other income and expenses of million increased by million in compared to million in the increase is due to higher interest income in due to higher interest rates applied to the investments portfolio 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurement  or sfas this standard defines fair value  establishes the framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements

delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until the beginning of the first quarter of the measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of sfas for financial assets and financial liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial conditions 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial conditions related to non financial assets and non financial liabilities beginning in the first quarter of upon adoption  the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions 
we are currently evaluating the effects of sfas on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect any significant impact on the results of operations or financial conditions

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
sfas will be effective for us on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
on july   the fasb held a meeting to discuss  among other things  the accounting method for net share settled securities  such as our convertible senior notes 
as a result of the meeting  the fasb voted to adopt a method for accounting for net share settled securities under which the debt and equity components of the security would be bifurcated and accounted for separately 
the effect of this proposal is that the equity component would be included in the paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes 
as a result  net loss attributable to our common stockholders would be higher as a result of the recognition of the accretion of the discounted carrying value of our convertible senior notes to their face amount as additional interest expense 
the diluted earnings per share calculation would continue to be calculated based on the treasury stock method 
in addition  the fasb may require that the new method be implemented retrospectively 
the fasb has not yet reached its final decision with respect to this proposed change to accounting treatment so there remains uncertainty as to the full impact of this accounting change 
we cannot predict the outcome of the fasb deliberations and whether the fasb is proposing that net share settled securities be accounted for under the existing method  the proposed method described above or some other method  and when any change would be implemented or whether it would be implemented retrospectively or prospectively 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised or sfas r  business combinations and statement no 
or sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulleting no 
or arb sfas r will impact financial statements on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
some of the changes  such as the accounting for contingent consideration  will introduce more volatility into earnings and may impact our acquisition strategy 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
in addition  sfas r will be applied prospectively and sfas will require retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests  while the remaining requirements of sfas shall be applied prospectively 
sfas r and sfas are effective on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas r and sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant operating losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through equity and debt financings 
in february  we completed a private placement of approximately million shares of common stock at per share 
our net proceeds were approximately million  after deducting offering costs and commissions 
in addition  in august  we finalized a private placement of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of and per share 
our net proceeds  which were approximately million after deducting offering costs  were used to fund operations 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s  through which we may sell from time to time any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants  in one or more offerings 
the aggregate initial offering price of all securities sold will not exceed  after the sale of our senior convertible notes described below  we had  remaining available for sale 
in february  we issued and sold under the shelf registration statement an aggregate principal amount of  of our convertible senior notes due these notes bear a interest per annum on the principal amount  payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning on august  interest accrual on the notes commenced on february  the notes will mature on february   unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or purchased by us or converted 
the notes will be convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  in certain circumstances 
upon conversion  a holder would receive cash up to the principal amount of the note and our common stock in respect of such note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
the notes are convertible only in the following circumstances during any calendar quarter after the quarter ended march  if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price  during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which if the average trading price per  principal amount of the notes is less than or equal to of the average conversion value of the notes during such five day period  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  if we call the notes for redemption and at anytime on or after december  to and including february  and anytime on or after february  upon a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes call spread transactions 
as a result of the call spread transactions  we do not anticipate experiencing an increase in the total shares outstanding from the conversion of the notes unless the price of our common stock appreciates above per share  effectively increasing the conversion premium to us to 
we purchased call options to cover approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares underlying the notes 
in addition  we sold warrants permitting the purchasers to acquire up to approximately million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had million invested in auction rate securities backed by federal and state student loan securities 
these securities are rated aaa by a major credit rating agency 
our auction rate securities are day taxable investments backed by federal and state student loans which carry aaa ratings 
the current overall credit concerns in capital markets may impact our ability to liquidate these securities 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days 
if the auctions for the securities we own fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful 
during the first quarter of  auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business 
we have classified auction rate securities of million as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the company continues to earn interest on the investments that failed to settle at auction  at the maximum contractual rate 
as of december   the carrying value of these investments was equal to the fair value 
the company will continue to monitor the value of its auction rate securities each reporting period for a possible impairment if a decline in fair value occurs 
in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we may need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in operating activities in was primarily related to net loss of million  non cash related items of million corresponding primarily to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  planned increase of inventories of million to support our increase in sales  increase in accounts receivable of million as a result of our increase in sales 
we monitor our accounts receivable turnover closely to ensure that receivables are collected timely and have established a credit and collection policy to facilitate our collection process and reduce our credit loss exposure 
we expect to grow our business and increase our revenues and to continue to use cash received from collection of outstanding receivables to fund our operations  net increase of other assets and other current assets of million  an increase in accounts payable in million to support the expansion of our operations and sales  a decrease in accrued compensation of million  and generated million of cash from increases in other accrued liabilities primarily related to the increase in price for the essure device with conceptus sas that will be recognized as a reduction to the purchase price of conceptus sas in january we expect cash usage in operating activities in the future to decrease 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  from sales and maturity of short term investments of million  offset by purchases of investments constituting auction rate securities and commercial paper of million and capital expenditures of million 
our capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
in our capital expenditures were primarily related to our capital investments to support in office hysteroscopy and increase physician utilization 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the net cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of the net proceeds of million from our issuance of senior convertible notes in february  the proceeds of million for the issuance of warrants in connection with our senior convertible notes and the proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock for our stock option programs and the employee stock purchase plan  offset by million for the cost of our purchase of call options on our convertible senior notes 
in  the net cash provided by financing activities consisted of approximately million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
cash requirements  contractual obligations and commitments we have operating lease obligations on our current building facility and automobiles used primarily by our sales personnel 
in addition  we have obligations related to our phase ii clinical study and pivotal trial 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years convertible senior notes   operating lease obligations  clinical trial obligations    interest on our convertible senior notes    total      on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with ovion pursuant to which we received a sole  worldwide license to ovion s patent rights relative to the essure system for ten years  and ovion is prohibited from granting any additional such licenses to other parties 
in exchange for such license  we were required to pay a license fee of million payable in our common stock in equal installments in the first and second quarters of in january  we paid million in common stock to ovion  and we made another payment of million in common stock to ovion in april in addition  the settlement agreement provided for a cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of as a prepaid royalty  which has been fully amortized as of december  prepaid royalties were approximately million as of december  we are obligated to pay of the cumulative revenue derived from sales of the essure system in excess of million as royalty for a period of ten years starting from the date of settlement 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  our prepaid royalties are fully amortized as of december  in february  we issued an aggregate principal amount of  of our convertible senior notes due refer to note  convertible senior notes of our notes to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these instruments 
we must settle at least a portion of our conversion obligation in cash  however we may not have sufficient funds to pay in full the cash obligation upon such conversion 
the successful achievement of our business objectives may require additional financing and therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our sales and marketing activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others resources devoted to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the liquidity of auction rate securities held in our investment portfolio  the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  our determination to acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses  the market price of our common stock as it affects the exercise of stock options and the conversion terms of our convertible debt  and the insurance payer community s acceptance of and reimbursement for the essure procedure 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we have been exposed to interest rate risk through interest earned on holdings of available for sale marketable securities 
as of december  we held million in auction rate securities which are variable rate debt instruments  which bear interest rates that reset approximately every days 
million of these auction rate securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at december  with an expected maturity of greater than one year 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 
in addition  in february we issued an aggregate principal amount of  of our convertible senior notes due refer to note convertible senior notes for a description of these instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk historically  all of our expenses and our revenues were typically denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we had low exposure for currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
on january   we entered into and closed a share purchase agreement the share purchase agreement with conceptus sas  which was entered into in connection with the exercise of our call option under the existing share purchase and call option agreement dated january  and amended on february  and on november  pursuant to the share purchase agreement  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of conceptus sas on january  as a result of this transaction  conceptus sas became a wholly owned subsidiary and its results of operations will be consolidated with our results of operations for financial reporting purposes 
the functional currency of conceptus sas is the euro therefore exposing us to changes in foreign exchange rates 
we will seek to manage our foreign exchange risk through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency costs  and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
conceptus sas has entered into a forward exchange contract to hedge dollar denominated estimated inventory purchases in we will be required to record the changes of the fair value of the hedge contract in our consolidated statement of operations 
in we did not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
