 revenue recognition in financial statements  financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
generally we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
consumer subscription products are paid in advance  typically for monthly  quarterly or annual periods 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription period 
revenue from sales of downloaded individual music tracks  albums and games are recognized at the time the music or game is made available  digitally  to the end user 
we recognize revenue under the residual method for multiple element software arrangements when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  under sop no 
under the residual method  at the outset of the arrangement with a customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of the arrangement s undelivered elements such as post contract support pcs  and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered  such as software licenses 
vsoe for pcs is established on standard products for which no installation or customization is required based upon amount charged when pcs is sold separately 
for multiple element software arrangements involving significant production  modification  or customization of the software  which are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sop no 
 vsoe for pcs is established if customers have an optional renewal rate specified in the arrangement and the rate is substantive 
we have arrangements whereby customers pay one price for multiple products and services and in some cases  involve a combination of products and services 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the individual deliverables in accordance with eitf issue no 
in the event that there is no objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the delivered items  the revenue recognized upon delivery is the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered items 
we apply significant judgment in establishing the fair value of multiple elements within revenue arrangements 
we recognize revenue on a gross or net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
in many arrangements  we contract directly with end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectability risk 
in such arrangements we report the revenue on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers and carry no collectability risk 
in such instances we report the revenue on a net basis 
revenue generated from advertising appearing on our websites and from advertising included in our products is recognized as revenue as the delivery of the advertising occurs 
music publishing rights and music royalty accruals 
we must make estimates of amounts owed related to our music publishing rights and music royalties for our domestic and international music services 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under copyright law  we may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings and compositions we deliver 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
table of contents under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
recoverability of deferred costs 
we defer costs on projects for service revenue and system sales 
deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems  as defined in individual customer contracts  including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties 
we recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract 
for revenue recognized under the completed contract method  costs are deferred until the products are delivered  or upon completion of services or  where applicable  customer acceptance 
for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method  costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation 
for revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract  costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing on the date of revenue recognition 
at each balance sheet date  we review deferred costs  to ensure they are ultimately recoverable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze the age of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
accrued loss on excess office facilities 
we made significant estimates in determining the appropriate amount of accrued loss on excess office facilities 
if we made different estimates  our loss on excess office facilities could be significantly different from that recorded  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
our original estimate has been revised in previous periods in response to changes in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area where the excess office facilities are located  or to reflect negotiated changes in sublease rates charged to occupying tenants 
impairment of investments 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in the fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
significant judgments and estimates must be made to assess whether an other than temporary decline in fair value of investments has occurred and to estimate the fair value of investments in privately held companies 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of any impairment charge if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
valuation of other intangible assets 
other intangible assets consist primarily of fair value of customer agreements and contracts  developed technology  trademarks  patents  and tradenames acquired in business combinations 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives and are subject to periodic review for impairment 
the initial recording and periodic review processes require extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
should conditions be different than management s current assessment  material write downs of intangible assets may be required 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of other intangible assets 
a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense in future periods 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
judgment is required in determining our reporting units and assessing fair value of the reporting units 
there were no impairments related to goodwill in any of the periods presented in this report 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  which we adopted as of january   stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we measured compensation expense for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 when the exercise price of our employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
minority interests 
the company records minority interest expense benefit which reflects the portion of the earnings losses of majority owned entities which are applicable to the minority interest partners in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements arb no 

redeemable minority interests that are redeemable at either fair value or are based on a formula that is intended to approximate fair value are accounted for in accordance with arb no 
as of december   the company s minority interests solely related to redeemable minority interests in rhapsody america 
minority interest expense benefit is included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock 
we account for any changes in our ownership interest resulting from the issuance of equity capital by consolidated subsidiaries as either a gain or loss in the statement of operations pursuant to sab no 
accounting for the sales of stock of a subsidiary 
sab no 
requires that the difference between the carrying amount of the parent s investment in a subsidiary and the underlying net book value of the subsidiary after the issuance of stock by the subsidiary be reflected as either a gain or loss in the statement of operations if the appropriate recognition criteria has been met or reflected as an equity transaction 
we have elected to reflect sab no 
gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
table of contents and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to past performance and our expectation of future taxable income  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes or withholding taxes on non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside of the us if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the availability of foreign tax credits and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested

we currently have no planned significant capital expenditures for other than those in the ordinary course of business 
in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing  or through other sources such as credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  in the future  we may enter into cash or stock acquisition transactions or other strategic transactions that could reduce cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to shareholders 
our principal commitments include office leases and contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one non us government or non us agency issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our securities portfolio 
we conduct our operations in ten primary functional currencies the us dollar  the korean won  the japanese yen  the british pound  the euro  the mexican peso  the brazilian real  the australian dollar  the hong kong dollar  and the singapore dollar 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in us dollars  except in korea  japan  germany  france  the united kingdom and australia  where we invoice our customers primarily in won  yen  euros  pounds  and australian dollars  respectively 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our financial results in   and 
table of contents at december   we had commitments to make the following payments less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands office leases up to up to convertible debt other contractual obligations up to up to total contractual cash obligations the terms and conditions of the convertible debt are described more fully in note other contractual obligations primarily relate to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers

the million is excluded from the table above as the timing and amount of these payments will vary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity investments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of high quality debt securities as specified in our investment policy 
investments in both fixed and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
additionally  a declining rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our short term investments until maturity and the substantial majority of our short term investments mature within one year of purchase  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
there have been no material changes in our investment methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short term investments during the year ended december  based on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents at december   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million

as of december   we had investments in voting capital stock of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale  carried at current market value and are classified as long term as they are strategic in nature 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
for investments in private companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee 
based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during  we determined that an other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred in one of our privately held investments resulting in an impairment charge of million to reflect changes in the fair value

based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during  we determined that no additional other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred and therefore no impairment charges were recorded 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business internationally in several currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation  the re measurement of non functional currency assets  liabilities and intercompany balances into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  and us dollar denominated sales to foreign customers 
a portion of these risks is managed through the use of financial derivatives  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
generally  our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract s inception 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short term intercompany 
table of contents balances  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts related to short term intercompany accounts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through results of operations 
however  we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions  long term investments  highly predictable anticipated exposures and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our foreign currency risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our financial results for the years ended december    and
