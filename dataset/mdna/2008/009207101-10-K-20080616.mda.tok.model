in september  the company amended its  secured long term revolving credit line to extend its expiration date to august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
there is no requirement for the company to maintain a lock box arrangement under this agreement 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions 
at march    was available under the terms of the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets

cash used in investing activities for fiscal was approximately  more than fiscal  due to increased capital expenditures in the current year largely due to the start up of gas as well as the purchase of short term investments with available cash  offset partially by the sale of investments 
cash used by financing activities was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to less cash outlay under the stock repurchase plan

there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures

the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of these arrangements 
impact of inflation the company believes that the recent increases in inflation have not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
seasonality ggs s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce ggs s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and ggs has been awarded two three year extensions on the contract 
although sales remain somewhat seasonal  this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts and allowed the company to be more efficient in its planning and production 
the air cargo segment of business is not susceptible to seasonal trends
