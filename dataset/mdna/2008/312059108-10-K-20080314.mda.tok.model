critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the company s transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance and iii sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  which requires adequate documentation to support the allowance for loan losses estimate 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance and the general allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
first  analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support from financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
then the migration of historical default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  industry and market conditions and trends  and other environmental factors are considered 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the general allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
also  the general allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance  non homogeneous loans which were not allocated a specific allowance upon their review 
the general allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical and peer group delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
the company also considers trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the general allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the general allowance also captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in the specific allowances 
executive overview this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding the company and the bank and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements 
as such  this discussion should be read carefully in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report 
the bank is the primary independent community bank in its immediate market area as measured by deposit market share 
it seeks to be the primary financial service provider for its market area by providing the right mix of consistently high quality customer service  efficient technological support  value added products  and a strong commitment to the community 
net income of million in was an decrease from net income of million 
the company and the bank s primary operating businesses are in commercial and retail lending  deposit accounts and core deposits  and assets under wms management 
loans  net of reserve  decreased in compared with growth of   and of net loans in    and  respectively 
deposits decreased from year end to year end compared with an increase of from year end to year end  and from year end to year end assets under wms management grew  and  respectively  during  and net interest income is the largest component of net income  and equals the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in and beyond as average interest earning assets increase  but this may be offset in part or in whole by a possible contraction in the bank s net interest margin resulting from competitive market conditions and a flat or inverted yield curve 
a steeper yield curve is projected to result in an increase in net interest income  while a flatter or inverted yield curve is projected to result in a decrease in net interest income 
the specific nature of the bank s variability in net interest income due to changes in interest rates  also known as interest rate risk  is to a large degree the result of the bank s deposit base structure 
during  demand deposits  now  and savings deposits averaged   and of total average deposits  respectively  while the more interest rate sensitive premium money market accounts  money market accounts  and certificates of deposit averaged  and of total average deposits  respectively 
the bank continues to have strong credit quality as evidenced by non performing assets totaling million or of total loans at december   as compared with million or of total loans at december  the provision for loan losses was  for compared with  for loan chargeoffs  net of recoveries  totaled million or of total loans for  compared with  or of total loans for approximately  of the chargeoffs for pertained to partial chargeoffs of two loan relationships  one that has been concluded without any additional loss  and the other that should be concluded without any significant future loss 
the  or increase in the provision for loan losses from to was largely in response to the  increase in net loan chargeoffs  partially offset by the continuation in the relatively low level of remaining non performing loans over the last year  as well as the net decline in loans outstanding during management seeks to continue the expansion of its branch network 
the bank has leased properties in haymarket  virginia and bristow  virginia  where it plans to build its ninth and tenth full service branch offices  respectively  both scheduled to open during the first quarter of the bank is looking toward these new retail markets for growth in deposits and wms income 
management seeks to increase the level of its fee income from deposits and wms through the increase of its market share within its marketplace 
the following table presents a quarterly summary of earnings for the last two years 
in  earnings exhibited a flattening  and in the fourth quarter  decline in profitability when compared with the same quarter from the prior year  primarily from the decreasing net interest margin and its impact on net interest income 
the decreasing net interest margin continued for the first three quarters of  which in turn  resulted in lower net interest income compared to the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  there was improvement in the net interest margin and net interest income  but this was more than offset by a  provision for loan losses

partially offsetting the impact of the declining net interest margin was the relatively small impact of total average earning assets increasing from million in to million in the percentage of average earning assets to total assets increased in to from in the net interest margin pressure caused by the economic environment of a flat and inverted yield curve proved to be challenging for the bank during much of at june   just as the federal open market committee the fed began raising the federal funds rate  the yield on a three month maturity treasury bond was or basis points below the yield on a five year treasury and basis points below the yield on a year treasury 
at october   that yield had inverted to the point that a three month treasury was yielding  while the five year and ten year treasury were yielding and  respectively 
the yield curve changed from a more than basis point premium for a longer investment to a position where there is no premium or  in fact  a discount 
this presented funding and interest margin management pressures  as a flat or inverted yield curve significantly increased competition for deposits and their cost 
while deposit costs rapidly increased  the lack of a similar movement in longer term rates limited the yield increase on fixed rate loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the fed began lowering the federal funds rate  and the shape of the yield curve became less flat and more positively sloped 
as a result  the net interest margin for the fourth quarter of improved to as compared to for the fourth quarter of through january   the fed has continued the reduction of the federal funds rate  which is projected to benefit the bank s net interest margin for at least the first two quarters of total interest income increased  or to million in from million in this increase was due to the increase in total average earning assets of million or  from to  as well as the basis point increase in the average yield 
average loan balances increased from million in to million in the average yield on loans increased to in compared with in together  this resulted in a  increase in interest and fee income from loans for compared with average investment security balances decreased million from million in to million in the tax equivalent average yield on investments increased from in to in together  there was a decrease in interest and dividend income on security investments of  or  from million in to million in interest income on federal funds sold decreased  from to as average balances and yield were virtually the same in both and total interest expense increased million or from million in to million in primarily due to the outflow of deposits from the bank s noninterest bearing demand deposits and the growth in the bank s premium money market account  as well as its time deposit accounts and now deposit accounts 
interest paid on deposits increased million or from million in to million in average premium money market account balances increased million from to while their average rate increased from to over the same period resulting in an additional  of interest expense in average time deposit balances increased million from to while the average rate on time deposits increased from to resulting in an additional  of interest expense in average now deposit balances increased million from to while the average rate on now accounts increased from to resulting in an additional  of interest expense in interest expense on federal funds purchased decreased  from to due to the million decrease in average federal funds purchased

the average rate on total interest bearing liabilities increased from in to in compared with net interest income increased  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from an increase in total average earning assets from million in to million in  largely offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
the percentage of average earning assets to total assets increased in to from in the company s net interest margin decreased from in to in primarily due to the economic environment of a flattening and inverted yield curve as previously discussed 
total interest income increased million or to million in from million in this increase was due to the increase in total average earning assets of million or  from to  as well as the basis point increase in the average yield on loans and the basis point increase in the average yield on investments

provision for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  and asset quality the provision for loan losses was  for   for  and  for the amount of the provision for loan loss for   and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in the bank s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
greater weight is given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
the increase in the provision for loan losses during was largely in response to the increase in net loan chargeoffs in the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to was largely in response to decline in net loan chargeoffs  as well as the continuation in the low level of non performing loans over the period  partially offset by the impact of continued growth in new loan originations during and loan chargeoffs  net of recoveries  totaled million for   for  and  for loan portfolio at december    and net loans accounted for   and of total assets  respectively  and were the largest category of the company s earning assets 
loans are shown on the balance sheets net of unearned discounts and the allowance for loan losses 
interest is computed by methods that result in level rates of return on principal 
loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectible  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
the company has adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgment the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under fasb statement no 
as is the case for all loans  charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
the bank considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to individual impairment under fasb statement no 
asset quality non performing assets  in most cases  consist of loans that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans that are days or more past due  as well as borrowers that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the net realizable value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
non performing assets totaled million or of total loans at december   as compared with million or of total loans at december  and  or of total loans at december  non performing assets as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses were  and at december   and  respectively 
the number of non performing loan relationships increased from seventeen at december  to thirty two at december   which was the primary reason for the increase in non performing assets 
the increase from december  to december  was primarily due to the addition to non performing status of two loan relationships 
the first relationship consists of multiple loans to one borrower totaling million 
of the million  approximately  has a federal government guarantee from the u 
s 
small business administration 
the second relationship consists of one loan totaling million collateralized by real estate 
loans that were days past due and accruing interest totaled   and  at december    and  respectively 
no loss is anticipated on any loan days past due and accruing interest 
of the loans days past due and accruing at december    consisted of two loans 
there are no loans  other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired  where information known about the borrower has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to repay 
at december   there are no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired 
at december   no concentration of loans to commercial borrowers engaged in similar activities exceeded of total loans 
the largest industry concentrations at december  were approximately of loans to the hospitality industry hotels  motels  inns  etc for more information regarding the bank s concentration of loans collateralized by real estate  please refer to the discussion under risk factors in item a of this report entitled we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a downturn in the real estate market  for any reason  may increase our credit losses  which would negatively affect our financial results 
based on recently enacted regulatory guidelines  the bank is now required to monitor the commercial investment real estate loan portfolio for a concentrations above of tier capital and loan loss reserve for construction and land loans and b for permanent investor real estate loans 
as of december   construction and land loans are million or of the concentration limit  while permanent investor real estate loans by naics code are million or of the concentration level 
total loans on the balance sheet are comprised of the following classifications as of december      and loan portfolio in thousands december  loans secured by real estate construction secured by farmland family residential commercial real estate commercial and industrial loans except those secured by real estate consumer loans to individuals except those secured by real estate all other loans total loans the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the bank s non accrual  restructured and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets  at the dates indicated non performing assets and loans contractually past due dollars in thousands years ended december  non accrual loans restructured loans other repossessed assets owned total non performing assets loans past due days accruing interest allowance for loan losses to total loans at period end non performing assets to period end loans and other repossessed assets owned potential problem loans for additional information regarding non performing assets and potential loan problems  see allowance for loan losses in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
analysis of loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on net realizable values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on the company s statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions 
at december      and  the allowance for loan losses was     and  respectively 
as a percentage of total loans  the allowance for loan losses declined from at december  to at december  even though the percentage of non performing assets to total loans and other repossessed assets increased from to over the same time period 
this was primarily due to an allowance for loan loss allocation of  specifically reserved for one loan at december  this loan was resolved in  with the resolution including the charge off of the previously reserved the following table summarizes the bank s loan loss experience for each of the years ended december      and  respectively analysis of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands years ended december  allowance for loan losses  january  loans charged off commercial and industrial construction secured by farmland family residential real estate commercial real estate consumer total loans charged off recoveries commercial and industrial construction secured by farmland family residential real estate commercial real estate consumer total loans recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses  december  ratio of net charge offs to average loans the following table allocates the allowance for loan losses at december      and to each loan category

this increase stemmed primarily from revenues related to the continued growth of the bank s deposit base and retail banking activities  and the increase of estate and brokerage fees within the bank s wms division 
wealth management income increased  or from to  primarily as the result of increased assets under management 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or to million for  compared with million for due to the increase in the number of transaction accounts generating fee income 
other service charges  commissions and fees increased  or from million in to million in primarily due to increased income from visa check card fees 
the increase in visa check fees is primarily due to the increase in the bank s retail deposit customer base 
included in other service charges  commissions  and income is bank owned life insurance boli income  which was  in compared with  in total boli was million at december   compared with million one year earlier 
there were no gains or losses on the sale of securities or other assets in management does not project any further gains or losses on the sale of securities at this time 
management seeks to increase the level of its future fee income from wealth management services and deposits through the increase of its market share within its marketplace 
wealth management fees are projected to continue to grow at a pace closer to the growth seen in and  rather than the growth seen in fees from deposits are projected to grow at a rate similar to and reflect the projected growth for retail core deposits 
compared with total non interest income increased by  from million in to million in wealth management income increased  or from to service charges on deposit accounts increased  or to million for  compared with million for other service charges  commissions and fees increased  or from million in to million in primarily due to increased income from visa check card fees 
during  the bank entered into an agreement cancelling a property usage contract 
in consideration for this agreement  the bank received a one time payment of  or approximately  net of applicable income taxes 
also during  management elected to sell  for asset liability restructuring purposes  approximately million of investment securities available for sale at a loss of  non interest expense compared with total non interest expense increased  or in compared with the primary component of this was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of  or  primarily due to customary annual salary increases  partially offset by decreases in defined benefit pension plan expenses and performance based incentive plan expenses 
full time equivalent personnel totaled at year end compared with at year end on december   the company s board of directors board approved the termination of the defined benefit pension plan effective on december   and effective january  the board approved to replace the defined benefit pension plan with an enhanced k plan 
defined benefit pension plan expenses are projected to decrease from  in to approximately  in and nothing in and going forward 
expenses for the k plan are projected to increase from  in to approximately  in and  and approximately  in growth in k after is projected to increase approximately at the same rate of increase as salaries 
the bank expects personnel costs  consisting primarily of salary and benefits  to continue to be its largest other expense 
as such  the most important factor with regard to potential changes in other expenses is the expansion of staff 
the cost of any additional staff expansion  however  would be expected to be offset by the increased revenue generated by the additional services that the new staff would enable the bank to perform 
during  the company projects the increase of approximately four full time equivalent people 
these new positions are planned in commercial lending and technology systems support 
in  the company will increase full time equivalent personnel in order to staff two new branch offices in haymarket and bristow

as of december   the appropriate regulatory authorities have categorized the company and the bank as well capitalized 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations and advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank uses its sources of funds to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the desirable funding level based in part on the bank s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of the bank s ability to generate funds 
management is not aware of any market or institutional trends  events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company or the bank 
nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
the bank s internal sources of such liquidity are deposits  loan and investment repayments  and securities available for sale 
the bank s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
cash and amounts due from depository institutions  interest bearing deposits in other banks  and federal funds sold totaled million at december  compared with million at december  these assets provide a primary source of liquidity for the bank 
in addition  management has designated the entire investment portfolio as available of sale  of which approximately million was unpledged and readily salable at december  futhermore  the bank has an available line of credit with the fhlb of atlanta with a borrowing limit of approximately million at december  to provide additional sources of liquidity  as well as available federal funds purchased lines of credit with various commercial banks totaling approximately million

capital the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations  and of tier i capital to average assets as defined in the regulations 
management believes  as of december   that the company and the bank more than satisfy all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
at december  and  the company exceeded its regulatory capital ratios  as set forth in the following table risk based capital ratios dollars in thousands december  tier capital shareholders equity plus unrealized loss on securities available for sale fas less intangible assets  net plus company obligated madatorily redeemable capital securities total tier capital tier capital allowable allowance for loan losses total capital risk weighted assets risk based capital ratios tier to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets contractual obligations the following table sets forth information relating to the company s contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than one year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes million of capital securities with varying put provisions beginning september  with a mandatory redemption september  off balance sheet arrangements the bank s off balance sheet arrangements consist of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  which were million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  see note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the specific arrangements and elements of credit and interest rate risk inherent to the arrangements

there were and separate standby letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
during and  no liabilities arose from standby letters of credit arrangements 
past history gives little indication as to future trends regarding revenues and liabilities from standby letters of credit 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
the bank is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  the bank is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the bank uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
the bank monitors exposure to instantaneous changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
the bank s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from instantaneous changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during the following tables present the bank s anticipated market value changes in equity under various rate scenarios as of december  and market risk percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold securities and interest bearing deposits with other banks loans receivable total rate sensitive assets other assets total assets demand deposits rate bearing deposits borrowed funds other liabilities total liabilities present value equity total liabilities and equity percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold securities and interest bearing deposits with other banks loans receivable total rate sensitive assets other assets total assets demand deposits rate bearing deposits borrowed funds other liabilities total liabilities present value equity total liabilities and equity
