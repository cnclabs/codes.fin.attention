the company s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to providing value added products and services to our customers 
generally  the company has sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing retail deposits as its primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial part of its assets in locally originated residential first mortgage loans  loans to business enterprises operating in its markets  and in investment securities 
specifically  the company s business strategy incorporates the following elements i operating as an independent community oriented financial institution  ii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  iii emphasizing investment in one to four family residential mortgage loans  loans to small businesses and investment securities  and iv maintaining a strong retail deposit base 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its investments in mortgage and other loans  investment securities and other assets  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of noninterest income  including income from fees  service charges and servicing rights  net gains and losses on sales of securities  loans and foreclosed real estate  and noninterest expense such as employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  which events are beyond the control of the company 
in particular  the general level of market rates tends to be highly cyclical 
page application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this report 
the company carries all of its security investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as an adjustment to shareholders equity 
based on management s assessment  at december   the company did not hold any security that had a fair value decline that is currently expected to be other than temporary 
consequently  any declines in a specific security s fair value below amortized cost have not been provided for in the consolidated income statement 
the company s ability to fully realize the value of its investment in various securities  including corporate debt securities  is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization 
executive summary total deposits for the company increased  to million at december   while the average balance of deposits increased million to million at december  the company will continue to focus on building market share in the central square and fulton markets where the existing pathfinder share of the market is less than 
in all other market areas  pathfinder currently has the majority of the current deposit market share 
pathfinder seeks to continue to develop core deposit relationships in all markets through the acquisition of demand deposit relationships 
efforts will also be focused on the expansion of commercial deposit relationships with the bank s existing commercial lending relationships

the loan portfolio increased with net growth in all loan categories 
the company expects to concentrate on continued commercial mortgage and commercial loan portfolio growth during the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was at december  compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in asset quality is primarily the result of a  increase in foreclosed real estate  combined with a  increase in non performing residential real estate loans

the company used the proceeds from that issuance to retire its original junior subordinated debenture on june   at its first call date 
the original obligation was for million  adjustable quarterly at a spread of over the month libor 
the new issuance and retirement of the original junior subordinated debenture resulted in an approximate pre tax savings of  to the company in future pre tax annual savings on the new debenture will amount to approximately  the company experienced net interest margin compression to in from in net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  the federal reserve increased its federal funds target rate times since june of  resulting in a total increase of during that period 
while these short term market interest rates increased  longer term market interest rates remained relatively unchanged  resulting in a flattening of the market yield curve 
during this extended period in which the yield curve was flat  net interest margin compression was significant as the company s deposits and borrowings repriced faster than the longer term interest earning assets  loans and security investments 
beginning in august of  the federal reserve bank began providing economic stimulus in the form of reductions in the short term interest rate reductions to the federal funds target rate 
as a result  the market yield curve now has some positive slope  and the lower shorter term rate environment has allowed management to aggressively lower deposit and borrowing costs while engaging in activities to retain yield on our securities and loan portfolios 
this will continue to be the company s primary emphasis over the near term to enhance net interest rate spread and margin as the market yield curve steepens

the company experienced a increase in noninterest income  exclusive of securities gains and losses  primarily attributable to increased deposit levels and the related service charges associated with checking accounts  an increase in issued visa debit cards and increased usage from the existing customer base and increased in house investment sales revenue 
noninterest expense increased due to increases in personnel expense  building occupancy  data processing and professional and other services  partially offset by reductions in amortization of intangibles and other expenses
