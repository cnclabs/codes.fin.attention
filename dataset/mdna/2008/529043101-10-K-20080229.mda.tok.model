other environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations  an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  in or under such property as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances 
these liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence or disposal of such substances 
although generally our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damage and claims related to the leased premises  in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of a tenant of such premises to satisfy any obligations with respect to such environmental liability  we may be required to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  as the owner of such properties  we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease 
from time to time  in connection with the conduct of our business and generally upon acquisition of a property  we authorize the preparation of phase i and  when necessary  phase ii environmental reports with respect to our properties 
based upon such environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties  as of the date of this 
table of contents annual report  we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the discovery of environmental conditions  the existence or severity of which were previously unknown  changes in law  the conduct of tenants  or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties  will not expose us to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which would adversely affect our financial condition and or results of operations

nyse ceo certification 
our chief executive officer made an unqualified certification to the nyse with respect to our compliance with the nyse corporate governance listing standards in june item a 
risk factors set forth below are material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations 
we are subject to risks involved in single tenant leases 
we focus our acquisition activities on real properties that are net leased to single tenants 
therefore  the financial failure of  or other default by  a single tenant under its lease is likely to cause a significant reduction in the operating cash flow generated by the property leased to that tenant and might decrease the value of that property 
we rely on revenues derived from major tenants 
revenues from several of our tenants and or their guarantors constitute a significant percentage of our base rental revenues 
as of december   our largest tenants guarantors  which occupied properties  represented approximately of our base rental revenue for the year ended december   including our 
table of contents proportionate share of base rental revenue from non consolidated entities and base rental revenue recognized from properties sold through the respective date of sale 
the default  financial distress or bankruptcy of any of the tenants of these properties could cause interruptions in the receipt of lease revenues from these tenants and or result in vacancies  which would reduce our revenues and increase operating costs until the affected property is re let  and could decrease the ultimate sales value of that property 
upon the expiration or other termination of the leases that are currently in place with respect to these properties  we may not be able to re lease the vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with the re leasing 
we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  indebtedness in furtherance of our activities 
neither our amended and restated declaration of trust nor any policy statement formally adopted by our board of trustees limits either the total amount of indebtedness or the specified percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our borrowing costs and profitability and can adversely affect our share price 
we have exposure to market risks relating to increases in interest rates due to our variable rate debt 
an increase in interest rates may increase our costs of borrowing on existing variable rate indebtedness  leading to a reduction in our net income 
as of december   we had outstanding million in consolidated variable rate indebtedness 
the level of our variable rate indebtedness  along with the interest rate associated with such variable rate indebtedness  may change in the future and materially affect our interest costs and net income 
in addition  our interest costs on our fixed rate indebtedness can increase if we are required to refinance our fixed rate indebtedness at maturity at higher interest rates 
we currently have an agreement with a third party for a notional amount of million which caps our interest rate at 
furthermore  the public valuation of our common shares is related primarily to the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions can affect the market value of our common shares 
for instance  if interest rates rise  the market price of our common shares may decrease because potential investors seeking a higher dividend yield than they would receive from our common shares may sell our common shares in favor of higher rate interest bearing securities 
recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us 
the united states credit markets have recently experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for borrowers less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
continued uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing at reasonable terms  which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell  as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
these events in the credit markets have also had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the united states  which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common shares or preferred shares 
these disruptions in the financial markets may have other adverse effects on us or the economy generally 

table of contents we face risks associated with refinancings 
a significant number of our properties  as well as corporate level borrowings  are subject to mortgage or other secured notes with balloon payments due at maturity 
as of december   the consolidated scheduled balloon payments for the next five calendar years  are as follows year balloon payments million million million million million our ability to make the scheduled balloon payments will depend upon our cash balances  the amount available under our credit facility and our ability either to refinance the related mortgage debt or to sell the related property 
as of december   the scheduled balloon payments for our non consolidated entities for the next five calendar years are as follows balloon payments our proportionate year balloon payments share 
million 
million 
million 
million 
million 
million 
million 
million our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time  such as the state of the national and regional economies  local real estate conditions  the state of the capital markets  available mortgage rates  the lease terms or market rates of the mortgaged properties  our equity in the mortgaged properties  our financial condition  the operating history of the mortgaged properties and tax laws 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing to fund the scheduled balloon payments or to sell the related property at a price that generates sufficient proceeds to pay the scheduled balloon payments  we would lose our entire investment in the related property 
we face uncertainties relating to lease renewals and re letting of space 
upon the expiration of current leases for space located in our properties  we may not be able to re let all or a portion of that space  or the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms or market rates 
if we are unable to re let promptly all or a substantial portion of the space located in our properties or if the rental rates we receive upon re letting are significantly lower than current rates  our net income and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected due to the resulting reduction in rent receipts and increase in our property operating costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants in any of our properties upon the expiration of their leases 
certain of our properties are cross collateralized 
as of december   the mortgages on three sets of two properties  one set of four properties and one set of three properties are cross collateralized 
in addition  the mlp s million loan of which million is outstanding at december  is secured by a borrowing base of properties 
to the extent that any of our properties are cross collateralized  any default by us under the mortgage note relating to one property will result in a default under the financing arrangements relating to any other property that also provides security for that mortgage note or is cross collateralized with such mortgage note 

table of contents we face possible liability relating to environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations  as an owner of real property  we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  in or under our properties  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances 
these liabilities may include government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
these laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence or disposal of those substances 
this liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of  or tenant at  the property 
the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
in addition  the presence of those substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral  which  in turn  would reduce our revenues and ability to make distributions 
a property can also be adversely affected either through physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances  or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties 
although our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises  in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy any obligations with respect to the property leased to that tenant  we may be required to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease 
from time to time  in connection with the conduct of our business  we authorize the preparation of phase i environmental reports and  when necessary  phase ii environmental reports  with respect to our properties 
based upon these environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties  as of the date of this annual report  we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the environmental reports will reveal all environmental conditions at our properties or that the following will not expose us to material liability in the future the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions  changes in law  activities of tenants  or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
uninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect our financial condition 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rent loss insurance on most of our properties  with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar properties 
however  with respect to those properties where the leases do not provide for abatement of rent under any circumstances  we generally do not maintain rent loss insurance 
in addition  there are certain types of losses  such as losses resulting from wars  terrorism or certain acts of god that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss of these types would adversely affect our financial condition 
future terrorist attacks such as the attacks which occurred in new york city  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   and the military conflicts such as the military actions taken by the 
table of contents united states and its allies in afghanistan and iraq  could have a material adverse effect on general economic conditions  consumer confidence and market liquidity 
among other things  it is possible that interest rates may be affected by these events 
an increase in interest rates may increase our costs of borrowing  leading to a reduction in our net income 
these types of terrorist acts could also result in significant damages to  or loss of  our properties 
we and our tenants may be unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable economic terms for losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
our lenders may require that we carry terrorism insurance even if we do not believe this insurance is necessary or cost effective 
we may also be prohibited under the applicable lease from passing all or a portion of the cost of such insurance through to the tenant 
should an act of terrorism result in an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss of these types would adversely affect our financial condition 
competition may adversely affect our ability to purchase properties 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies  financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources than we have that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants who will lease space in our properties 
due to our focus on net lease properties located throughout the united states  and because most competitors are locally and or regionally focused  we do not encounter the same competitors in each market 
our competitors include other reits  financial institutions  insurance companies  pension funds  private companies and individuals 
this competition may result in a higher cost for properties that we wish to purchase 
our failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and share price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards may be modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of moreover  effective internal controls  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and to maintain our qualification as a reit and are important to helping prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  our reit qualification could be jeopardized  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our shares could drop significantly 
we may have limited control over our co investment programs and joint venture investments 
our co investment programs and joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by us  including the possibility that our partner might  at any time  become bankrupt  have different interests or goals than we do  or take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of co investment programs and joint venture investments include impasse on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor our partner have full control over the co investment programs or joint venture 
also  there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of funds that may be invested in co investment programs and joint ventures 
one of co investment programs  concord  is owned equally by the mlp and a subsidiary of winthrop 
this co investment program  is managed by an investment committee which consists of seven members  three members appointed by each of the mlp and winthrop with one appointee from each of the mlp and winthrop qualifying as independent and the seventh member appointed by fur holdings llc  the administrative manager of concord and primary owner of the former external advisor of the mlp and the current external advisor of winthrop 
each investment in excess of million to be made by this joint venture  as well as additional material matters  requires the consent of the investment committee appointed by the mlp and winthrop 
accordingly  concord may 
table of contents not take certain actions or invest in certain assets even if the mlp believes it to be in its best interest 
michael l 
ashner  our executive chairman and director of strategic acquisitions is also the chairman and chief executive officer of winthrop  the managing member of fur holdings llc and the seventh member of concord s investment committee 
another co investment program  nls  is managed by an executive committee comprised of three persons appointed by us and two persons appointed by our partner 
with few exceptions  the vote of four members of the executive committee is required to conduct business 
accordingly  we do not control the business decisions of this co investment 
investments by our co investment programs may conflict with our ability to make attractive investments 
under the terms of the limited partnership agreement governing nls  we are required to first offer to nls all opportunities to acquire real estate assets which  among other criteria  are specialty in nature and net leased 
only if nls elects not to approve the acquisition opportunity or the applicable exclusivity conditions have expired  may we pursue the opportunity directly 
as a result  we may not be able to make attractive acquisitions directly and may only receive an interest in such acquisitions through our interest in nls 
certain of our trustees and officers may face conflicts of interest with respect to sales and refinancings 
michael l 
ashner  e 
robert roskind and richard j 
rouse  our executive chairman and director of strategic acquisitions  co vice chairman  and co vice chairman and chief investment officer  respectively  each own limited partnership interests in certain of our operating partnerships  and as a result  may face different and more adverse tax consequences than our other shareholders will if we sell certain properties or reduce mortgage indebtedness on certain properties 
those individuals may  therefore  have different objectives than our other shareholders regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale of such properties or reduction of mortgage debt 
accordingly  there may be instances in which we may not sell a property or pay down the debt on a property even though doing so would be advantageous to our other shareholders 
in the event of an appearance of a conflict of interest  the conflicted trustee or officer must recuse himself or herself from any decision making or seek a waiver of our code of business conduct and ethics 
our ability to change our portfolio is limited because real estate investments are illiquid 
equity investments in real estate are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changed conditions will be limited 
our board of trustees may establish investment criteria or limitations as it deems appropriate  but currently does not limit the number of properties in which we may seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
we could change our investment  disposition and financing policies without a vote of our shareholders 
there can be no assurance that we will remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we have met the requirements for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december   and we intend to continue to meet these requirements in the future 
however  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code  for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will remain qualified as a reit 
the code provisions and income tax regulations applicable to reits are more complex than those applicable to corporations 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to continue to qualify as a reit 
in addition  no assurance can be given that legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements for qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
if we do not qualify as a reit  we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our net taxable income 
in addition  our income would be subject to tax at the regular corporate rates 
we also could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be significantly reduced for each 
table of contents year in which we do not qualify as a reit 
in that event  we would not be required to continue to make distributions 
although we currently intend to continue to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause us  without the consent of the shareholders  to revoke the reit election or to otherwise take action that would result in disqualification 
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility 
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income for that calendar year 
our taxable income is determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of i of our ordinary income for that year  ii of our capital gain net income for that year and iii of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to reduce exposure to federal income and nondeductible excise taxes 
differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in determining our income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis in order to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 
certain limitations limit a third party s ability to acquire us or effectuate a change in our control 
limitations imposed to protect our reit status 
in order to protect us against the loss of our reit status  our declaration of trust limits any shareholder from owning more than in value of any class of our outstanding shares  subject to certain exceptions 
the ownership limit may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us 
severance payments under employment agreements 
substantial termination payments may be required to be paid under the provisions of employment agreements with certain of our executives upon a change of control 
we have entered into employment agreements with five of our executive officers which provide that  upon the occurrence of a change in control of us including a change in ownership of more than of the total combined voting power of our outstanding securities  the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  dissolution  the acquisition  except from us  of or more of our voting shares or a change in the majority of our board of trustees  four of those executive officers would be entitled to severance benefits based on their current annual base salaries  recent annual cash bonuses and the average of the value of the two most recent long term incentive awards and one of those executive would be entitled to severance benefits based on his current annual base salary and recent annual cash bonus  as defined in the employment agreements 
accordingly  these payments may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
limitation due to our ability to issue preferred shares 
our amended and restated declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to issue preferred shares  without shareholder approval 
the board of trustees is able to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued which could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us  even if a change in control were in shareholders best interests 
as of the date of this annual report  we had outstanding  series b preferred shares that we issued in june   series c preferred shares that we issued in december and january   series d preferred shares that we issued in february  and one share of our special voting preferred stock that we issued in december in connection with the merger 
our series b  series c and series d preferred shares include provisions that may deter a change of control 
the establishment and issuance of shares of our existing series of preferred shares or a future series of preferred shares could make a change of control of us more difficult 
limitation imposed by the maryland business combination act 
the maryland general corporation law  as applicable to maryland reits  establishes special restrictions against business combinations between a maryland reit and interested shareholders or their affiliates unless an exemption is applicable 
an interested shareholder includes a person who beneficially owns  and an affiliate or associate of the trust who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting 
table of contents power of our then outstanding voting shares  but a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have been an interested shareholder 
among other things  maryland law prohibits for a period of five years a merger and certain other transactions between a maryland reit and an interested shareholder 
the five year period runs from the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder 
thereafter  any such business combination must be recommended by the board of trustees and approved by two super majority shareholder votes unless  among other conditions  the common shareholders receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its shares 
the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions  including business combinations that are exempted by the board of trustees prior to the time that the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
the business combination statute could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers  even if such acquisition would be in shareholders best interests 
in connection with our merger with newkirk  vornado realty trust  which we refer to as vornado  and apollo real estate investment fund iii  lp  which we refer to as apollo  were granted a limited exemption from the definition of interested shareholder 
maryland control share acquisition act 
maryland law provides that control shares of a maryland reit acquired in a control share acquisition shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the vote entitled to be cast on the matter under the maryland control share acquisition act 
shares owned by the acquiror  by our officers or by employees who are our trustees are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter 
control shares means shares that  if aggregated with all other shares previously acquired by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing trustees within one of the following ranges of voting power one tenth or more but less than one third  one third or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of all voting power 
control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained shareholder approval 
a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares  subject to certain exceptions 
if voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a shareholders meeting  then subject to certain conditions and limitations the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value 
if voting rights of such control shares are approved at a shareholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote  all other shareholders may exercise appraisal rights 
any control shares acquired in a control share acquisition which are not exempt under our by laws will be subject to the maryland control share acquisition act 
our amended and restated by laws contain a provision exempting from the maryland control share acquisition act any and all acquisitions by any person of our shares 
we cannot assure you that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 
limits on ownership of our capital shares may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us 
for us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  among other requirements  not more than of the value of our outstanding capital shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined for federal income tax purposes to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year  and these capital shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year in each case  other than the first such year for which a reit election is made 
our amended and restated declaration of trust includes certain restrictions regarding transfers of our capital shares and ownership limits 
actual or constructive ownership of our capital shares in excess of the share ownership limits contained in its declaration of trust would cause the violative transfer or ownership to be void or cause the shares to be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to a person or entity who can own the shares without violating these limits 
as a result  if a violative transfer were made  the recipient of the shares would not acquire any economic or voting rights attributable to the transferred shares 
additionally  the constructive ownership rules for these limits are complex and groups of related individuals or entities may be deemed a single owner and consequently in violation of the share ownership limits 

table of contents these restrictions and limits may not be adequate in all cases  however  to prevent the transfer of our capital shares in violation of the ownership limitations 
the ownership limits discussed above may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us  even though a change of control could involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in shareholders best interests 
legislative or regulatory tax changes could have an adverse effect on us 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended 
any of those new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or you as a shareholder 
reit dividends generally are not eligible for the reduced rates currently applicable to certain corporate dividends unless attributable to dividends from taxable reit subsidiaries and otherwise eligible for such rates 
as a result  investment in non reit corporations may be relatively more attractive than investment in reits 
this could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
our board of trustees may change our investment policy without shareholders approval 
subject to our fundamental investment policy to maintain our qualification as a reit  our board of trustees will determine its investment and financing policies  growth strategy and its debt  capitalization  distribution  acquisition  disposition and operating policies 
our board of trustees may revise or amend these strategies and policies at any time without a vote by shareholders 
accordingly  shareholders control over changes in our strategies and policies is limited to the election of trustees  and changes made by our board of trustees may not serve the interests of shareholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to distribute cash to shareholders or qualify as a reit 
the intended benefits of the merger may not be realized 
the merger presented and continues to present challenges to management  including the integration of our operations and properties with those of newkirk 
the merger also poses other risks commonly associated with similar transactions  including unanticipated liabilities  unexpected costs and the diversion of management s attention to the integration of the operations of the two entities 
any difficulties that we encounter in the transition and integration processes  and any level of integration that is not successfully achieved  could have an adverse effect on our revenues  level of expenses and operating results 
we may also experience operational interruptions or the loss of key employees  tenants and customers 
as a result  notwithstanding our expectations  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits or cost savings of the merger 
we may not be able to successfully implement and complete the strategic restructuring plan 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to implement and complete the strategic restructuring plan as disclosed in our current report on form k filed with the sec on june  as a result  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the strategic restructuring plan 
we may also incur significant expenses and experience operational interruptions while implementing the strategic restructuring plan 
our inability to carry out our growth strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth strategy is based on the acquisition and development of additional properties and related assets  including acquisitions of large portfolios and real estate companies and acquisitions through co investment programs such as joint ventures 
in the context of our business plan  development generally means an expansion or renovation of an existing property or the acquisition of a newly constructed property 
we may provide a developer with a commitment to acquire a property upon completion of construction of a property and commencement of rent from the tenant 
our plan to grow through the acquisition and development of new properties could be adversely affected by trends in the real estate and financing businesses 
the consummation of any future acquisitions will be subject to satisfactory completion of an extensive valuation analysis and due diligence review and to the negotiation of definitive documentation 
our ability to implement our strategy may be impeded because we may have difficulty 
table of contents finding new properties and investments at attractive prices that meet our investment criteria  negotiating with new or existing tenants or securing acceptable financing 
if we are unable to carry out our strategy  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
acquisitions of additional properties entail the risk that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations  including operating and leasing expectations 
redevelopment and new project development are subject to numerous risks  including risks of construction delays  cost overruns or force majeure events that may increase project costs  new project commencement risks such as the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits  and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
some of our acquisitions and developments may be financed using the proceeds of periodic equity or debt offerings  lines of credit or other forms of secured or unsecured financing that may result in a risk that permanent financing for newly acquired projects might not be available or would be available only on disadvantageous terms 
if permanent debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms to refinance acquisitions undertaken without permanent financing  further acquisitions may be curtailed or cash available for distribution to shareholders may be adversely affected 
the concentration of ownership by certain investors may limit other shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions

depending upon the number of such securities exchanged or exercised at one time  an exchange or exercise of such securities could be dilutive to or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of our common shares 
we are dependent upon our key personnel and the terms of mr 
ashner s employment agreement affects our ability to make certain investments 
we are dependent upon key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we are dependent on our executive officers for business direction

ashner s employment 
this provision in mr 
ashner s agreement may cause us not to avail ourselves of those other business opportunities due to the potential consequences of acquiring such non net lease business opportunities 
our inability to retain the services of any of our key personnel or our loss of any of their services could adversely impact our operations 
we do not have key man life insurance coverage on our executive officers 
risks specific to our investment in concord in addition to the risks described above  our investment in concord is subject to the following additional risks concord invests in subordinate mortgage backed securities which are subject to a greater risk of loss than senior securities 
concord may hold the most junior class of mortgage backed securities which are subject to the first risk of loss if any losses are realized on the underlying mortgage loans 
concord invests in a variety of subordinate loan securities  and sometimes holds a first loss subordinate holder position 
the ability of a borrower to make payments on the loan underlying these securities is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower since the underlying loans are generally non recourse in nature 
in the event of default and the exhaustion of any equity support  reserve funds  letters of credit and any classes of securities junior to those in which concord invests  concord will not be able to recover all of its investment in the securities purchased 
expenses of enforcing the underlying mortgage loans including litigation expenses  expenses of protecting the properties securing the mortgage loans and the liens on the mortgaged properties  and  if such expenses are advanced by the servicer of the mortgage loans  interest on such advances will also be allocated to such first loss securities prior to allocation to more senior classes of securities issued in the securitization 
prior to the reduction of distributions to more senior securities  distributions to the first loss securities may also be reduced by payment of compensation to any servicer engaged to enforce a defaulted mortgage loan 
such expenses and servicing compensation may be substantial and consequently  in the event of a default or loss on one or more mortgage loans contained in a securitization  concord may not recover its investment 
concord s warehouse facilities and its cdo financing agreements may limit its ability to make investments 
in order for concord to borrow money to make investments under its repurchase facilities  its repurchase counterparty has the right to review the potential investment for which concord is seeking financing 
concord may be unable to obtain the consent of its repurchase counterparty to make certain investments 
concord may be unable to obtain alternate financing for that investment 
concord s repurchase counterparty consent rights with respect to its warehouse facility may limit concord s ability to execute its business strategy 
the repurchase agreements that concord uses to finance its investments may require it to provide additional collateral 
if the market value of the loan assets and loan securities pledged or sold by concord to a repurchase counterparty decline in value  which decline is determined  in most cases  by the repurchase counterparty  concord may be required by the repurchase counterparty to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced 
concord may not have the funds available to pay down its debt  which could result in defaults 
posting additional collateral to support its repurchase facilities will reduce concord s liquidity and limit its ability to leverage its assets 
because concord s obligations under its repurchase facilities are recourse to concord  if concord does not have sufficient liquidity to meet such requirements  it would likely result in a rapid deterioration of concord s financial condition and solvency 

table of contents concord s future investment grade cdos  if any  will be collateralized with loan assets and debt securities that are similar to those collateralizing its existing investment grade cdo  and any adverse market trends are likely to adversely affect the issuance of future cdos as well as concord s cdos in general 
concord s existing investment grade cdo is collateralized by fixed and floating rate loan assets and debt securities  and we expect that future issuances  if any  will be backed by similar loan assets and debt securities 
any adverse market trends that affect the value of these types of loan assets and debt securities will adversely affect the value of concord s interests in the cdos and  accordingly  our interest in concord 
such trends could include declines in real estate values in certain geographic markets or sectors  underperformance of loan assets and debt securities  or changes in federal income tax laws that could affect the performance of debt issued by reits 
credit ratings assigned to concord s investments are subject to ongoing evaluations and we cannot assure you that the ratings currently assigned to concord s investments will not be downgraded 
some of concord s investments are rated by moody s investors service  fitch ratings or standard poor s  inc the credit ratings on these investments are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies  and we cannot assure you that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
if rating agencies assign a lower than expected rating or reduce  or indicate that they may reduce  their ratings of concord s investments the market value of those investments could significantly decline  which may have an adverse affect on concord s financial condition 
the use of cdo financings with coverage tests may have a negative impact on concord s operating results and cash flows 
concord s current cdo contains  and it is likely that future cdos  if any  will contain coverage tests  including over collateralization tests  which are used primarily to determine whether and to what extent principal and interest proceeds on the underlying collateral debt securities and other assets may be used to pay principal of and interest on the subordinate classes of bonds in the cdo 
in the event the coverage tests are not met  distributions otherwise payable to concord may be re directed to pay principal on the bond classes senior to concord s 
therefore  concord s failure to satisfy the coverage tests could adversely affect concord s operating results and cash flows 
certain coverage tests which may be applicable to concord s interest in its cdos based on delinquency levels or other criteria may also restrict concord s ability to receive net income from assets pledged to secure the cdos 
if concord s assets fail to perform as anticipated  concord s over collateralization or other credit enhancement expenses associated with its cdo will increase 
there can be no assurance of completing negotiations with the rating agencies or other key transaction parties on any future cdos  as to what will be the actual terms of the delinquency tests  over collateralization  cash flow release mechanisms or other significant factors regarding the calculation of net income to concord 
failure to obtain favorable terms with regard to these matters may materially reduce net income to concord 
if credit spreads widen  the value of concord s assets may suffer 
the value of concord s loan securities is dependent upon the yield demand on these loan securities by the market based on the underlying credit 
a large supply of these loan securities combined with reduced demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on these loan securities  resulting in a higher  or wider  spread over the benchmark rate of such loan securities 
under such conditions  the value of loan securities in concord s portfolio would tend to decline 
such changes in the market value of concord s portfolio may adversely affect its net equity through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on available for sale loan securities  and therefore concord s cash flow  since concord would be unable to realize gains through sale of such loan securities 
also  they could adversely affect concord s ability to borrow and access capital 
the value of concord s investments in mortgage loans  mezzanine loans and participation interests in mortgage and mezzanine loans is also subject to changes in credit spreads 
the majority of the loans concord invests in are floating rate loans whose value is based on a market credit spread to libor 
the value of the loans is dependent upon the yield demanded by the market based on their credit 
the value of concord s portfolio would tend to decline should the market require a higher yield on such loans  resulting in the use of a higher spread over the 
table of contents benchmark rate 
any credit or spread losses incurred with respect to concord s loan portfolio would affect concord in the same way as similar losses on concord s loan securities portfolio as described above 
concord prices its assets based on its assumptions about future credit spreads for financing of those assets 
concord has obtained  and may obtain in the future  longer term financing for its assets using structured financing techniques such as cdos 
such issuances entail interest rates set at a spread over a certain benchmark  such as the yield on united states treasury obligations  swaps or libor 
if the spread that investors are paying on structured finance vehicles over the benchmark widens and the rates concord charges on its securitized assets are not increased accordingly  this may reduce concord s income or cause losses 
prepayments can increase  adversely affecting yields on concord s investments 
the value of concord s assets may be affected by an increase in the rate of prepayments on the loans underlying its loan assets and loan securities 
the rate of prepayment on loans is influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond concord s control and consequently such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
in periods of declining real estate loan interest rates  prepayments of real estate loans generally increase 
if general interest rates decline as well  the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the loans that were prepaid 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios concord may fail to recoup fully its cost of acquisition of certain investment 
concord may not be able to issue cdo securities  which may require concord to seek more costly financing for its real estate loan assets or to liquidate assets 
concord has and may continue to seek to finance its loan assets on a long term basis through the issuance of cdos 
prior to any new investment grade cdo issuance  there is a period during which real estate loan assets are identified and acquired for inclusion in a cdo  known as the repurchase facility accumulation period 
during this period  concord authorizes the acquisition of loan assets and debt securities under one or more repurchase facilities from repurchase counterparties 
the repurchase counterparties then purchase the loan assets and debt securities and hold them for later repurchase by concord 
concord contributes cash and other collateral to be held in escrow by the repurchase counterparty to back concord s commitment to purchase equity in the cdo  and to cover its share of losses should loan assets or debt securities need to be liquidated 
as a result  concord is subject to the risk that it will not be able to acquire  during the period that its warehouse facilities are available  a sufficient amount of loan assets and debt securities to support the execution of an investment grade cdo issuance 
in addition  conditions in the capital markets may make it difficult  if not impossible  for concord to pursue a cdo when it does have a sufficient pool of collateral 
if concord is unable to issue a cdo to finance these assets or if doing so is not economical  concord may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate the assets at a price that could result in a loss of all or a portion of the cash and other collateral backing its purchase commitment 
the recent capital market crisis has made financings through cdos difficult 
the recent events in the subprime mortgage market have impacted concord s ability to consummate a second cdo 
although concord holds only one bond of million which has minimal exposure to subprime residential mortgages  conditions in the financial capital markets have made issuances of cdos at this time less attractive to investors 
as of december   concord has recorded an other than temporary impairment charge relating to this asset of million 
if concord is unable to issue future cdos to finance its assets  concord will be required to hold its loan assets under its existing warehouse facilities longer than originally anticipated or seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing 
the inability to issue future cdos at accretive rates will have a negative impact on concord s cash flow and anticipated return 
the lack of a cdo market may require us to make a larger equity investment in concord 
as of december   we had committed to invest up to million in concord  of which million remains to be invested 
in view of the difficulties in the cdo market  we may continue to invest additional amounts in concord only upon approval of our board of trustees 

table of contents concord may not be able to access financing sources on favorable terms  or at all  which could adversely affect its ability to execute its business plan and its ability to make distributions 
concord finances its assets through a variety of means  including repurchase agreements  credit facilities  cdos and other structured financings 
concord may also seek to finance its investments through the issuance of common or preferred equity interests 
concord s ability to execute this strategy depends on various conditions in the capital markets  which are beyond its control 
if these markets are not an efficient source of long term financing for concord s assets  concord will have to find alternative forms of long term financing for its assets 
this could subject concord to more expensive debt and financing arrangements which would require a larger portion of its cash flows  thereby reducing cash available for distribution to its members and funds available for operations as well as for future business opportunities 
concord may make investments in assets with lower credit quality  which will increase our risk of losses 
concord may invest in unrated loan securities or participate in unrated or distressed mortgage loans 
the anticipation of an economic downturn  for example  could cause a decline in the price of lower credit quality investments and securities because the ability of obligors of mortgages  including mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities  to make principal and interest payments may be impaired 
if this were to occur  existing credit support in the warehouse structure may be insufficient to protect concord against loss of its principal on these investments and securities

lexington streetsboro llc v 
alfred geis  et al 
beginning in january  on behalf of one of our co investment programs  we received notices from the tenant in our streetsboro  ohio facility regarding certain alleged deficiencies in the construction of the facility as compared to the original building specifications 
upon acquisition of the facility from the developer  the then owner of the facility obtained an indemnity from the principals of the developer covering a breach of construction warranties  the construction and or the condition of the premises 
after two years of correspondence among the owner of the facility  the developer and the tenant  we after our acquisition of the facility from our co investment program entered into an amendment to the lease with the tenant providing for the repair of a portion of the alleged deficiencies and commenced such repairs beginning in the summer of following a demand for reimbursement under the indemnity agreement  we filed suit against the developer and the principals of the developer in the federal district court for the northern district of ohio on august  to enforce our rights lexington streestboro llc v 
alfred geis  et al  case no 
cv 
on november   the developer filed counter claims against us for unjust enrichment regarding the repair work performed and for a declaration of its obligations under the indemnity agreement and multiple cross claims against its sub contractors asking to be reimbursed for any deficiencies in the building specifications for which they are held liable 
the developer was also permitted by the court to file a claim against the tenant 
the suit is on going 
as of december   we have incurred million of expenses in connection with the work covered by the lease amendment and the enforcement of our rights under the indemnity agreement 
we may seek an additional million for future costs that may be incurred in connection with other potential deficiencies 
we intend to vigorously pursue our claims and reimbursement under the indemnity agreement 
deutsche bank securities  inc on june   we  including a co investment program as it relates to the antioch claim  sold to deutsche bank securities  inc  which we refer to as deutsche bank  a million bankruptcy damage claim against dana corporation for million  which we refer to as the farmington hills claim  and a million bankruptcy damage claim against dana corporation for million  which we refer to as the antioch claim 
under the terms of the agreements covering the sale of the claims  we are obligated to reimburse deutsche bank should the claim ever be disallowed  subordinated or otherwise impaired  to the extent of such disallowance  subordination or impairment  plus interest at the rate of per annum from the date of payment of the purchase price by deutsche bank to us 
on october   dana corporation filed an objection to both claims 
we assisted deutsche bank and the then holders of the claims in the preparation and filing of a response to the objection 
despite a belief by us that the objections were without merit  the holders of the claims  without our consent  settled the allowed amount of the claims at million for the farmington hills claim and million for the antioch claim 
deutsche bank has made a formal demand with respect to the farmington hills claim in the amount of million plus interest  but has not made a formal demand with respect to the antioch claim  which we estimate would be million plus interest 
we informed deutsche bank that we do not intend to honor any demand for a variety of reasons  including that the holders of the claims arbitrarily settled the claims for reasons based on factors other than the merits and the holders of the claims voluntarily reduced the claims to participate in certain settlement pools 
we intend to vigorously defend any further claims or demands by deutsche bank or the holders of the claims

these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives  among other things 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the anticipated results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our results to differ  possibly materially  from those indicated in the forward looking statements include  among others  those discussed below under risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report and cautionary statements concerning forward looking statements in part i  of this annual report 
general we are a self managed and self administered real estate investment trust formed under the laws of the state of maryland 
we operate primarily in one segment and our primary business is the investment in and the acquisition  ownership and management of a geographically diverse portfolio of net leased office  industrial and retail properties 
substantially all of our properties are subject to triple net leases  which are generally characterized as leases in which the tenant bears all or substantially all of the costs and or cost increases for real estate taxes  utilities  insurance and ordinary repairs 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ended december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to shareholders 
as of december   we had ownership interests in approximately consolidated real estate assets  located in states and the netherlands and encompassing million rentable square feet 
during  we purchased eight properties from unrelated parties  for an aggregate capitalized cost of million 
in addition  we acquired our partners interests in four co investment programs for million in cash 
as of december   we leased properties to numerous tenants in a variety of industries 
our revenues and cash flows are generated predominantly from property rent receipts 
growth in revenue and cash flows is directly correlated to our ability to acquire income producing properties and to re lease properties that are vacant  or may become vacant at favorable rental rates 
the challenge we face is finding investments that will provide an attractive return without compromising our real estate underwriting criteria 
we believe we have access to acquisition opportunities due to our relationship with developers  brokers  corporate users and sellers 
re leasing properties as leases expire and properties currently vacant at favorable effective rates is one of our primary focuses 
the primary risks associated with re tenanting properties are the period of time required to find a new tenant  whether rental rates will be lower than previously received  the significant leasing costs such as commissions and tenant improvement allowances and the payment of operating costs such as real estate taxes and insurance while there is no offsetting revenue 
we address these risks by contacting tenants well in advance of lease maturity to get an understanding of their occupancy needs  contacting local brokers to determine the depth of the rental market and retaining local expertise to assist in the re tenanting of a property 
pursuant to our strategic restructuring plan we focus on buying general purpose office and industrial real estate assets which have one or more of the following characteristics an investment grade tenant  adaptability to a variety of users  including multi tenant use  and an attractive geographic location 
no assurance can be given that once a property becomes vacant it will subsequently be re let 
during  we sold consolidated properties for million and contributed sold properties to nls for million in cash and an equity position of million 
during  we sold eight properties  including one property through foreclosure  to unrelated third parties for a net sales price of million 
during  we sold eight properties  including one sold through a non consolidated entity  to unrelated parties for a net sales price of million 
in addition in  we contributed seven properties to various non consolidated entity programs for million  which approximated carrying costs 

table of contents we believe that the restructuring plan will allow us to improve the quality of our portfolio  enhance shareholder value by increasing cash flows  simplify factors relating to our valuation  and operate more efficiently 
inflation certain of the long term leases on our properties contain provisions that may mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled fixed base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  a majority of the leases on our properties require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses 
in addition  the leases on our properties are generally structured in a way that minimizes our responsibility for capital improvements 
critical accounting policies our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require our management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
business combinations 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which we refer to as sfas  and record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value 
on december   we acquired newkirk through the merger  which was a variable interest entity vie 
we follow the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
revised consolidation of variable interest entities  which we refer to as fin r  and  as a result  we have recorded the minority interest in newkirk at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition 
the value of the consideration issued in common shares was based upon a reasonable period before and after the date that the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired in accordance with sfas sfas requires that the fair value of the real estate acquired  which includes the impact of mark to market adjustments for assumed mortgage debt relating to property acquisitions  is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets  which includes land  building and improvements  and fixtures and equipment  of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions 
in allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market in place lease values are recorded based on the difference between the current in place lease rent and a management estimate of current market rents 
below market lease intangibles are recorded as part of deferred revenue and amortized into rental revenue over the non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
above market leases are recorded as part of intangible assets and amortized as a direct charge against rental revenue over the non cancelable portion of the respective leases 

table of contents the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets  consisting of in place leases and customer relationships  is measured by the excess of the purchase price paid for a property over the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant  determined as set forth above 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
the value of in place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non cancelable periods and any bargain renewal periods of the respective leases 
the value of customer relationships are amortized to expense over the applicable lease term plus expected renewal periods 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases  as amended  which we refer to as sfas sfas requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
renewal options in leases with rental terms that are lower than those in the primary term are excluded from the calculation of straight line rent  if they do not meet the criteria of a bargain renewal option 
in those instances in which we fund tenant improvements and the improvements are deemed to be owned by us  revenue recognition will commence when the improvements are substantially completed and possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant 
when we determine that the tenant allowances are lease incentives  we commence revenue recognition when possession or control of the space is turned over to the tenant for tenant work to begin 
the lease incentive is recorded as a deferred expense and amortized as a reduction of revenue on a straight line basis over the respective lease term 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for sales of real estate  as amended  which we refer to as sfas the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
to the extent we sell a property and retain a partial ownership interest in the property  we recognize gain to the extent of the third party ownership interest in accordance with sfas accounts receivable 
we continuously monitor collections from our tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that we have identified 
as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts is insignificant 
impairment of real estate and investment in non consolidated entities 
we evaluate the carrying value of all real estate and investments in non consolidated entities held when a triggering event under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as amended  which we refer to as sfas  has occurred to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes reviewing anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  and an estimate of what lease rents will be if the property is vacant coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  estimating market lease rents and future sale proceeds is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
tax status 
we have made an election to qualify  and believe we are operating so as to qualify  as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax  provided that distributions to our shareholders equal at least the amount of our reit taxable income as defined under sections through of the code 
we are now permitted to participate in certain activities from which we were previously precluded in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the code 
lra and lexington contributions inc  which we refer to as lci  are  and lsac was a  taxable reit subsidiaries 
as such  we are subject to federal and state income taxes on the income we receive from these activities 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit 
table of contents carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
properties held for sale 
we account for properties held for sale in accordance with sfas sfas requires that the assets and liabilities of properties that meet various criteria be presented separately in the statement of financial position  with assets and liabilities being separately stated 
the operating results of these properties are reflected as discontinued operations in the statement of operations 
properties that do not meet the held for sale criteria of sfas are accounted for as operating properties 
basis of consolidation 
we determine whether an entity for which we hold an interest should be consolidated pursuant to fin r 
if the entity is not a variable interest entity  and we control the entity s voting shares or similar rights  the entity is consolidated 
fin r requires us to evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights 
liquidity and capital resources general 
since becoming a public company  our principal sources of capital for growth have been the public and private equity and debt markets  property specific debt  our credit facility  issuance of op units and undistributed cash flows 
we expect to continue to have access to and use these sources in the future  however  there are factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt to fund acquisitions is dependent upon our existing leverage  the value of the assets we are attempting to leverage and general economic and credit market conditions  which may be outside of management s control or influence 
as of december   we held interests in approximately consolidated properties  which were located in states and the netherlands 
the real estate assets are primarily subject to triple net leases  which are generally characterized as leases in which the tenant pays all or substantially all of the cost and cost increases for real estate taxes  capital expenditures  insurance  utilities and ordinary maintenance of the property 
during the year ended december   in addition to the acquisition of our four co investment programs  we purchased eight properties from third parties for a capitalized cost of million and sold consolidated properties to third parties for aggregate proceeds of million  which resulted in a gain of million 
our principal sources of liquidity are revenues generated from the properties  interest on cash balances  amounts available under our unsecured credit facility  the mlp s secured loan  co investment programs and amounts that may be raised through the sale of securities in private or public offerings 
for the years ended december  and  the leases on our consolidated properties generated million and million  respectively  in rental revenue 
the significant increase is due to the number of assets acquired in the merger  the acquisition of the co investment programs and the consolidation of lsac effective in the fourth quarter of in february  we completed an offering of million series d preferred shares  having a liquidation amount of per share and an annual dividend rate of raising net proceeds of million 
the mlp has a secured loan with key bank  na  which bears interest at libor plus basis points 
as of december   million was outstanding under the secured loan 
the secured loan is scheduled to mature in june the secured loan requires monthly payments of interest only 
the mlp is also required to make principal payments from the proceeds of certain property sales and certain refinancings if proceeds are not reinvested into net leased properties 
the required principal payments are based on a minimum release price set forth in the secured loan agreement 
the secured loan has customary covenants  which the mlp was in compliance with at december  during  we obtained million in non recourse mortgage financings  which have a fixed weighted average interest rate of 
the proceeds of the financing were used to partially fund acquisitions 
during  we issued  through a wholly owned subsidiary  million in trust preferred notes 
these trust preferred notes  which are classified as debt  are due in  are redeemable by us commencing april and bear interest at a fixed rate of through april and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus basis points through maturity 

table of contents in  the mlp issued million in guaranteed exchangeable notes due in  which can be put by the holder every five years commencing and upon certain events 
the net proceeds of the issuance were used to repay indebtedness under the mlp s former secured loan 
the notes are currently exchangeable at certain times by the holders into our common shares at a price of per share  however  the principal balance must be satisfied in cash 
during  in addition to the merger  we including non consolidated entities  obtained million in non recourse mortgage financings which have a fixed weighted average interest rate of 
the proceeds of the financings were used to partially fund acquisitions 
during  we completed a common share offering of million shares raising aggregate net proceeds of million 
during  we issued  series c preferred shares  at per share and a dividend rate of  raising net proceeds of million 
dividends 
in connection with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we expect to continue paying regular dividends to our shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  we generally intend to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio  reserving such amounts as we consider necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in our portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as our board of trustees considers appropriate 
dividends paid to our common and preferred shareholders increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase is attributable to the increase in our outstanding common and preferred shares and the special dividend paid in january relating to the merger 
although we receive the majority of our base rental payments on a monthly basis  we intend to continue paying dividends quarterly 
amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by us in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
we believe that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund our operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our credit facility  issuance of equity and debt and co investment programs as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by us 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for the underlying drivers that impact working capital and therefore cash flows from operations are the timing of collection of rents  including reimbursements from tenants  the collection of advisory fees  payment of interest on mortgage debt and payment of operating and general and administrative costs 
we believe the net lease structure of the majority of our tenants leases enhances cash flows from operations since the payment and timing of operating costs related to the properties are generally borne directly by the tenant 
collection and timing of tenant rents is closely monitored by management as part of our cash management program 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties  joint ventures and notes receivable 
cash provided by investing activities related primarily to collection of notes receivable  distributions from non consolidated entities in excess of accumulated earnings and proceeds from the sale of properties 
therefore  the fluctuation in investing activities relates primarily to the timing of investments and dispositions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities during each year was primarily attributable to proceeds from equity offerings  non recourse mortgages and borrowings under our credit facility offset by dividend and distribution payments and debt payments 
upreit structure 
our upreit structure permits us to effect acquisitions by issuing to a property owner  as a form of consideration in exchange for the property  op units in our operating partnerships 
substantially all 
table of contents outstanding op units are redeemable by the holder at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis or  at our election  with respect to certain op units  cash 
substantially all outstanding op units require us to pay quarterly distributions to the holders of such op units equal to the dividends paid to our common shareholders and the remaining op units have stated distributions in accordance with their respective partnership agreement 
to the extent that our dividend per share is less than a stated distribution per unit per the applicable partnership agreement  the stated distributions per unit are reduced by the percentage reduction in our dividend 
no op units have a liquidation preference 
we account for outstanding op units in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease  as such op units are redeemed for our common shares 
in connection with the merger  the mlp effected a reverse unit split pursuant to which each outstanding mlp unit was converted into mlp units totaling million mlp units  other than mlp units held directly or indirectly by us 
during  one of our operating partnerships issued thousand units or million in connection with an acquisition 
during  one of our operating partnerships issued million op units for approximately million in cash 
as of december   there were million op units outstanding 
of the total op units outstanding  approximately million are held by related parties 
as of december   there were million op units outstanding  other than op units held directly or indirectly by us 
financing revolving credit facility 
our million revolving credit facility with wachovia bank na and a consortium of other banks  expires june and bears interest at basis points over libor depending on our leverage as defined in the credit facility 
our credit facility contains customary financial covenants including restrictions on the level of indebtedness  amount of variable debt to be borrowed and net worth maintenance provisions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  no borrowings were outstanding  million was available to be borrowed  and million letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility 
we have the ability to extend the maturity date of the facility to june by requesting such extension from the lenders between february  and march  and paying million 
we anticipate that we will extend the maturity date 
the mlp has a secured loan with key bank  na  which bears interest at libor plus basis points 
as of december   million was outstanding under the secured loan 
the secured loan is scheduled to mature in june the secured loan requires monthly payments of interest only 
the mlp is also required to make principal payments from the proceeds of certain property sales and certain refinancings if such proceeds are not reinvested into net leased properties 
the required principal payments are based on a minimum release price set forth in the secured loan agreement 
the secured loan has customary covenants  which the mlp was in compliance with at december  in  the mlp issued million in guaranteed exchangeable notes due in  which can be put by the holder every five years commencing and upon certain events 
the net proceeds were used to repay indebtedness 
during  we issued million in trust preferred notes 
these trust preferred notes  which are classified as debt  are due in  are redeemable by us commencing april and bear interest at a fixed rate of through april and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus basis points through maturity 
debt service requirements 
our principal liquidity needs are the payment of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   there were billion of mortgages and notes payable outstanding  including discontinued operations 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was approximately 
our ability to make debt service payments will depend upon our rental 
table of contents revenues and our ability to refinance the mortgage related thereto  sell the related property  have available amounts under our credit facility or access other capital 
our ability to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  our equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition and the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
we expect to continue to use property specific  non recourse mortgages as we believe that by properly matching a debt obligation  including the balloon maturity risk  with a lease expiration  our cash on cash returns increase and the exposure to residual valuation risk is reduced 
in december  we informed the lender for our milpitas  california property that we would no longer make debt service payments and our intention to convey the property to the lender to satisfy the mortgage 
we recorded a million impairment charge in relating to this property and a gain on debt satisfaction of million upon foreclosure on the property by the lender in during  we satisfied a million mortgage note by making a million cash payment plus assigning a million escrow to the lender  which resulted in a gain of million 
other lease obligations 
since our tenants generally bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs  we do not anticipate significant needs for cash for these costs  however  for certain properties  we have a level of property operating expense responsibility 
we generally fund property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which is funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  we would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
in addition certain leases require us to fund tenant expansions 
our tenants generally pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to us as increased rent 
contractual obligations 
the following summarizes the company s principal contractual obligations as of december  s and thereafter total notes payable contract rights payable purchase obligations tenant incentives operating lease obligations includes ground lease payments and office rent 
amounts disclosed through include rent for our principal executive office which is fixed through and adjusted to fair market value as determined at january therefore  the amounts for and thereafter do not include principal executive office rent 
in addition certain ground lease payments due under bond leases allow for a right of offset between the lease obligation and the debt service and accordingly are not included 
we have million in outstanding letters of credit 
includes balloon payments 
capital expenditures 
due to the net lease structure  we do not incur significant expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain our properties 
however  as leases expire  we expect to incur costs in extending the existing tenant leases or re tenanting the properties 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
these expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or borrowings on our credit facility 

table of contents share repurchases 
in september  our board of trustees approved a funding limit for the repurchase of million common shares op units  and authorized any repurchase transactions within that limit 
in november  our board of trustees approved an additional million common shares op units for repurchase  thereby increasing the funding limit to million common shares op units available for repurchase 
from september to march  we repurchased approximately million common shares op units at an average price of per common share op unit 
in november  our board of trustees increased the remaining amount of common shares op units eligible for repurchase  so that an aggregate of million common shares op units were then available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 
in march  the board of trustees increased the remaining amount of common shares op units eligible for repurchase up to million 
in december  the board of trustees increased the remaining amount of common share op units eligible for repurchase up to million 
as of december   million common shares op units were eligible for repurchase under the authorization 
in  approximately million common shares op units were repurchased in the open market and through private transactions with our employees and op unitholders at an average price of per share 
results of operations year ended december  compared with december  changes in our results of operations are primarily due to the merger  which was effective december   and the acquisition of the outstanding interests in our co investment programs during the second quarter of of the increase in total gross revenues in of million  million is attributable to rental revenue

the primary increase in advisory and incentive fees relates to promoted interests million earned with respect to two co investment programs and one advisory agreement 
the increase in interest and amortization expense of million is due to the increase in long term debt due to the growth of our portfolio resulting from the merger and the acquisition of the outstanding interests in our co investment programs 
the increase in property operating expense of million is primarily due to an increase in properties for which we have operating expense responsibility  including an increase in vacancy 
the increase in depreciation and amortization of million is due primarily to the growth in real estate and intangibles through the acquisition of properties in the merger and the acquisition of the outstanding interests in our co investment programs 
intangible assets are amortized over a shorter period of time generally the lease term than real estate assets 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million is due primarily to costs associated with the merger million  the costs associated with lsac million  costs incurred in the formation of nls million  and professional fees million all of which is offset by a reduction in other costs including personnel costs million  which relates primarily to the accelerated amortization of non vested common shares in of million and an increase in severance costs in of million 
non operating income increased million due primarily to increased interest and dividends from investments  offset by a gain in relating to the sale of a dana bankruptcy claim

the increase is due to the items discussed above offset by an increase in preferred dividends of million resulting from the issuance of series d preferred shares 
the increase in net income in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by us 
without acquisitions  the sources of growth in net income are limited to index adjusted rents such as the consumer price index  percentage rents  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and by controlling other variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management s control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates and tenant monetary defaults and the other risks described in this annual report

environmental matters based upon management s ongoing review of our properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties  which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  changes in law  the conduct of tenants  or activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties  will not expose us to material liability in the future

ashner  our executive chairman and director of strategic acquisitions  holds an equity interest in and controls wrp 
the concord advisor has substantially the same executive officers as winthrop realty trust and wrp 
certain investments and other material decisions with respect to concord s business require the consent of both us and wrt or our and wrt s representatives on concord s investment committee 
concord s objective is to produce a stable income stream from investments in loan assets and debt securities by carefully managing credit risk and interest rate risk 
concord derives earnings from interest income rather than trading gains and intends to hold its loan assets and debt securities to maturity 
accordingly  the loan assets and debt securities in which concord invests are selected based on their long term earnings potential and credit quality 
concord seeks to achieve its objective by acquiring and originating loan assets and debt securities collateralized by the core real estate groups of existing income producing office  retail  multi family  warehouse and hospitality assets 
concord does not generally invest in industrial  r d  special use or healthcare assets and concord does not invest in any development projects  single family projects  condominium or condo conversion projects  raw land  synthetic loans or loans originated on assets located outside of the united states but may have interest in such assets if the underlying asset experiences a change in use 
further  concord does not directly invest in single family home mortgages nor does it acquire loan assets or debt securities where the underlying obligor is either winthrop realty trust or us or our respective affiliates 
concord only invests in assets in which the pool of potential buyers is broad and seeks to avoid assets which lack existing cash flow and or were developed on a for sale basis 
moreover  depending on the size of the loan class  concord generally seeks to acquire between and of the ownership position in the loan assets or debt securities in which it invests so as to control any decision making which might occur with respect to such instrument in the future 
concord s sole exposure to the single family residential market is with respect to an million investment in a billion bond  of which is subordinate to concord s position 
collateral for this bond can consist of up to of residential loans  with the balance of the collateral consisting of commercial loans 
at december   the collateral for this bond consisted of only of residential loans  some of which are considered sub prime 
as of december   concord recorded an other than temporary impairment charge on this investment of million 
simultaneous with or following the acquisition of a loan asset or debt security  concord seeks to enhance the return on its investment by obtaining financing 
concord s original business model was to refinance its loan assets with long term debt through the issuance of cdos 
to this end  concord formed its first cdo  concord real estate cdo  ltd  which we refer to as cdo  pursuant to which it refinanced approximately million of its loan assets and debt securities 
the debt capital markets generally have experienced an increase in volatility and reduction in liquidity since the second quarter of  which was initially triggered by credit concerns emanating from the single family residential market  particularly those loans commonly referred to as sub prime loans 
as a result of the increased volatility and reduction in liquidity in the debt capital markets  securitizations have become difficult if not 
table of contents impossible to execute 
as a result  concord has continued to finance its loan assets and debt securities through repurchase facilities that are either similar to revolving loans where concord has the ability to repurchase current assets on such facility pay back the loan with respect to such asset and finance other loan assets through such facility or to term loans in that only specific loan assets secure such facility and once satisfied  concord cannot use the facility for additional loan assets 
see credit facilities  below 
concord expects to issue additional cdos or other types of securitizations at such time  if at all  as such issuances will generate attractive risk adjusted equity returns 
cdos are a securitization structure whereby multiple classes of debt are issued to finance a portfolio of income producing assets  such as loan assets and debt securities 
cash flow from the portfolio of income producing assets is used to repay the cdo liabilities sequentially  in order of seniority 
the most senior classes of debt typically have credit ratings of aaa through bbb and therefore can be issued at yields that are lower than the average yield of the assets backing the cdo 
that is  the gross interest payments on the senior classes of cdo securities are less than the average of the interest payment received by the cdo from its assets 
on its existing cdo  concord retained  and concord expects that it will retain on any future cdos  the equity and the junior cdo debt securities 
as a result  assuming the cdo s assets are paid in accordance with their terms  concord s return will be enhanced as concord will retain the benefit of the spread between the yield on the cdo s assets and the yield on the cdo s debt 
the equity and the junior cdo debt securities that concord retained and intends to retain are the most junior securities in the cdo s capital structure and are usually unrated or rated below investment grade 
concord also earns ongoing management fees for its management of the cdo collateral 
a portion of these management fees is senior to the aaa rated debt securities of each cdo 
in cdo  the level of leverage on the underlying assets was approximately 
the leverage level of concord s future cdos may vary depending on the composition of the portfolio and market conditions at the time of the issuance of each cdo 
concord may increase or decrease leverage on its investment grade cdos  at securitization  upward or downward to improve returns or to manage credit risk 
in addition to cdo s  concord may also use other capital markets vehicles and structures to finance its real estate debt portfolio 
the concord advisor provides accounting  collateral management and loan brokerage services to concord and its subsidiaries  including cdo for providing these services  in concord paid to the concord advisor a management fee of million  which fees were based on the gross amount of loan assets acquired  and million as reimbursement for certain direct costs incurred by the concord advisor solely for the benefit of concord 
cdo concord holds loan assets and loan securities 
on december   concord formed its first cdo  concord real estate cdo  ltd  which we refer to as cdo  pursuant to which it financed approximately million of its loan assets by issuing an aggregate of approximately million of investment grade debt 
concord retained an equity and junior debt interest in the portfolio with a notional amount of million 
that is  if cdo does not ultimately have sufficient funds to satisfy all of its obligations to its noteholders  concord will bear the first million in loss  one half of which would be attributable to our interest in concord 
the financing through cdo enhanced concord s return on the loan assets and loan securities held in cdo as the weighted average interest rate on the loan assets and loan securities held in cdo at december  was and the weighted average interest rate on the amount payable by concord on its notes at december  was 
accordingly  assuming the loan assets and loan securities are paid in accordance with their terms  concord retains an average spread of the difference between the interest received on the loan assets and loan securities and the interest paid on the loan assets and loan securities

in the repurchase agreements entered into by concord to date  the lender  referred to as the repurchase counterparty  purchases the loan asset or loan security from or on behalf of concord and holds it on its balance sheet 
concord then repurchases the loan asset or loan security in cash on a specific repurchase date or  at the election of concord  an earlier date 
while the loan asset is held by the repurchase counterparty  the repurchase counterparty retains a portion of each interest payment made on such loan asset or loan security equal to the price differential  which is effectively the interest rate on the purchase price paid the repurchase counterparty to concord for the loan asset or loan security  with the balance of such payments being paid to concord 
pursuant to the terms of the repurchase agreements  if the market value of the loan assets or loan securities pledged or sold by concord decline  which decline is determined  in most cases  by the repurchase counterparty  concord may be required by the repurchase counterparty to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced
