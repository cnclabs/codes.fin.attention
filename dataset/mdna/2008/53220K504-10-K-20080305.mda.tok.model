research and development expenses from discontinued operations were million  million and million in  and respectively 
competition some of the drugs we are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing ir related approaches to drug discovery and development 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors 
many of our existing or potential competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
for example  glaxosmithkline is developing eltrombopag  a tpo mimetic that could compete with our lgd if both were to be approved for marketing 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
for a discussion of the risks associated with competition  see below under item a 
risk factors 
government regulation the manufacturing and marketing of our products  our ongoing research and development activities and products being developed by our collaborative partners are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceuticals are subject to rigorous regulation by federal and various state authorities  including the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  which must become effective before 
table of contents human clinical trials may commence  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of an nda to the fda and the fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda and  in california  with the food and drug branch of california 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to pre approval inspections by the fda prior to marketing approval  then to biennial inspections  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with cgmp and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
in addition  changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect to us 
for marketing outside the united states before fda approval to market  we must submit an export permit application to the fda 
we also are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs 
the requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and there can be no assurance that we or any of our partners will meet and sustain any such requirements 
we are also increasingly subject to regulation by the states 
a number of states now regulate  for example  pharmaceutical marketing practices and the reporting of marketing activities  controlled substances  clinical trials and general commercial practices 
we have developed and are developing a number of policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with these state laws  in addition to the federal regulations described above 
significant resources are now required on an ongoing basis to ensure such compliance 
for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations  see below under item a 
risk factors 
patents and proprietary rights we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
as of december   we have filed or participated as licensee in the filing of approximately currently pending patent applications in the united states relating to our technology  as well as foreign counterparts of certain of these applications in multiple countries 
in addition  we own or have licensed rights covered by approximately patents issued or applications  granted or allowed worldwide  including united states patents and foreign counterparts to united states patents 
except for a few patents and applications that are not material to our commercial success  these patents and applications will expire between and royalties we currently receive from king on avinza represent substantially all of our ongoing revenue 
the united states patent on avinza expired in november  however  an application for a generic form of avinza has been submitted to the fda 
subject to compliance with the terms of the respective agreements  our rights under our licenses with our exclusive licensors extend for the life of the patents covering such developments 
for a discussion of the risks associated with patent and proprietary rights  see below under item a 
risk factors 
human resources as of january   we had full time employees  of whom are involved directly in scientific research and development activities 
of these employees  hold phd or phd degrees 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following is a summary description of some of the many risks we face in our business 
you should carefully review these risks in evaluating our business  including the businesses of our subsidiaries 
you should also consider the other information described in this report 
risks related to us and our business 
we rely heavily on collaborative relationships  and any disputes or litigation with our collaborative partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us  including milestone payments and future royalty revenues 
our strategy for developing and commercializing many of our potential products  including products aimed at larger markets  includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners and others 
these collaborations have provided us with funding and research and development resources for potential products for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
these agreements also give our collaborative partners significant discretion when deciding whether or not to pursue any development program 
our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful  and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may develop drugs  either alone or with others that compete with the types of drugs they are developing with us 
this would result in increased competition for our programs 
if products are approved for marketing under our collaborative programs  revenues we receive will depend on the manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts of our collaborative partners  who generally retain commercialization rights under the collaborative agreements 
generally  our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations under specified circumstances 
if any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully  our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated 
disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators  including disputes or litigation over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
such disputes or litigation could adversely affect our rights to one or more of our product candidates  including our lgd and other small molecule tpo mimetic compounds 
any such dispute or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the collaborative research  development and commercialization of certain potential products  create uncertainty as to ownership rights of intellectual property  or could result in litigation or arbitration 
the occurrence of any of these problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
our product candidates face significant regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent sales 
before we obtain the approvals necessary to sell any of our potential products  we must show through preclinical studies and human testing that each product is safe and effective 
we and our partners have a number of products moving toward or currently awaiting regulatory action  including eltrombopag  bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene 
failure to show any product s safety and effectiveness could delay or prevent regulatory approval of a product and could adversely affect our business 
the clinical trials process is complex and uncertain 
for example  the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials may not necessarily predict the results from later large scale clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials may not demonstrate a product s safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
recently  a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials or in seeking regulatory approvals  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after regulatory approvals are received 
such additional trials may be expensive and time consuming  and failure to successfully conduct those trials could jeopardize continued commercialization of a product 
the rate at which we complete our clinical trials depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a 
table of contents function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and longer development times 
in addition  our collaborative partners have rights to control product development and clinical programs for products developed under the collaborations 
as a result  these collaborative partners may conduct these programs more slowly or in a different manner than expected 
moreover  even if clinical trials are completed  we or our collaborative partners still may not apply for fda approval in a timely manner or the fda still may not grant approval 
third party intellectual property may prevent us or our partners from developing our potential products and we may owe a portion of any payments we receive from our collaborative partners to one or more third parties 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in addition  disputes with licensors under our license agreements may arise which could result in additional financial liability or loss of important technology and potential products and related revenue  if any 
further  the manufacture  use or sale of our potential products or our collaborative partners products or potential products may infringe the patent rights of others 
this could impact avinza  eltrombopag  bazedoxifene  lasofoxifene  lgd and any other products or potential products 
see note of the consolidated financial statements  collaboration agreements and royalty matters 
several drug companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents for technologies that may be related to our business 
others have filed patent applications and received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications we have licensed for our use  either by claiming the same methods or compounds or by claiming methods or compounds that could dominate those licensed to us 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential while pending in the patent and trademark office and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
in march we received a letter from counsel to salk alleging that we owe salk royalties on prior sales of targretin as well as a percentage of the amounts received from eisai 
salk alleges that it is owed at least of the consideration paid by eisai for the portion of our oncology product line and associated assets attributable to targretin 
in an april  request for mediation  salk repeated these claims and asserted additional claims that increase the amount of royalty buy out payments allegedly owed to salk 
a mediation hearing in june attended by representatives from ligand and salk left the matter unresolved 
in july  salk filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association seeking at least million for alleged breach of contract based on salk s theory that it is entitled to a portion of the money paid by eisai to ligand for targretin related assets 
we do not believe that salk has a valid basis for its claims and intend to vigorously oppose any claim that salk may bring for payment related to these matters 
on october  we received a letter from rockefeller university  or rockefeller  claiming that it is owed of the milestone payments received by us from our partner glaxosmithkline for eltrombopag and the backup compound sb  as well as of any future milestone and royalty payments that we may receive from glaxosmithkline based on the development and sale of these compounds 
to date we have received million of milestone payments from glaxosmithkline for these compounds 
in the letter  rockefeller also stated its rejection of a notice we sent to rockefeller on august  to terminate the september  license agreement between us and rockefeller 
on march   we filed a declaratory judgment action against rockefeller in the united states district court for the southern district of california seeking  among other things  a judicial determination that i eltrombopag and the backup compound sb including the use of such compounds do not embody any invention s described or claimed in certain licensed patent rights under our september  license agreement with rockefeller  ii rockefeller technical information was not essential to the discovery or development of eltrombopag and the backup compound sb  iii we are not liable for 
table of contents any additional payments under our september  license agreement with rockefeller beyond any payments that we ve already made  and iv our september  license agreement with rockefeller was terminated in november  and that subsequent to the termination of such agreement  we are not liable for future payments under such agreement 
however  intellectual property disputes are subject to inherent uncertainties and there can be no assurance this action for declaratory judgment will be resolved favorably to us or that the lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on us 
also on march   rockefeller filed suit against us in the supreme court of the state of new york in new york county alleging  among other things  a breach by us of our september  license agreement with rockefeller  as well as other causes of action for unjust enrichment  quantum meruit  specific performance to perform an audit and declaratory relief 
the complaint seeks damages of at least million  plus alleges that rockefeller is entitled to of payments to be received by us in the future related to promacta and sb or from any third party in connection with certain products which products  according to the complaint  include lgd  and of future net sales of certain of our products which products  according to the complaint  include lgd 
the complaint requests a trial by jury  and also seeks to impose a constructive trust upon payments received by us to which rockefeller claims it is owed a portion 
further  these and other possible disagreements or litigation with our collaborative partners could delay our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve milestones or our receipt of other payments 
in addition  these and any other possible disagreements or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the research  development and commercialization of certain potential products being developed by either our collaborative partners or by us 
moreover  if we are unable to resolve the current dispute with rockefeller or any other possible disagreements with licensors or collaborative partners  protracted litigation or arbitration could result 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
as noted above  salk has brought a claim against us in arbitration and rockefeller has filed a lawsuit against us claiming  inter alia  that it is owed and will be owed certain payments under our agreement with them 
other third parties have not directly threatened an action or claim against us  although we do periodically receive other communications or have other conversations with the owners of other patents or other intellectual property 
if others obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 
we are substantially dependent on avinza royalties for our revenues 
king is obligated to pay us royalties in the future based on sales of avinza by king 
specifically  king is required to pay us a royalty on avinza net sales during the first months after the closing of the sale of the avinza product line in february beginning in october  royalty payments will be based upon calendar year net sales of avinza 
if calendar year net sales are less than million  the royalty payment will be of all net sales 
if calendar year net sales are greater than million  the royalty payment will be of all net sales less than million  plus of net sales greater than million 
in addition  beginning in  we will no longer be entitled to receive royalties on a quarterly basis  but will collect royalties on an annual basis  which may adversely impact our cash flows 
these royalties represent and will for some time represent substantially all of our ongoing revenue 
although we may also receive royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations  the amount of revenue from these royalties and milestones is unknown and highly uncertain 
as a result  any setback that may occur with respect to avinza could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price for our stock 
setbacks could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 
on september   king reported that actavis  a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products headquartered in iceland  had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with a 
table of contents paragraph iv certification pertaining to avinza  the rights to which were acquired by king from us in february according to the report  actavis s paragraph iv certification sets forth allegations that us patent no 
 the patent  which pertains to avinza which is listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  will not be infringed by actavis s manufacture  use  or sale of the product for which the anda was submitted 
the expiration date for this patent is november king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan corporation  plc and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey on october  against actavis  inc and actavis elizabeth llc for patent infringement under the patent 
the lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent actavis from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 
avinza was licensed from elan corporation which is its sole manufacturer 
any problems with elan s manufacturing operations or capacity could reduce sales of avinza  as could any licensing or other contract disputes with elan  raw materials suppliers  or others 
similarly  king s avinza sales efforts could be affected by a number of factors and decisions regarding its organization  operations  and activities as well as events both related and unrelated to avinza  including sales force reorganizations and lower than expected sales call and prescription volumes 
avinza could also face stiffer competition from existing or future pain products 
the negative impact on the avinza s sales growth in turn may negatively affect our royalties  revenues and earnings 
avinza sales may also be negatively impacted by higher than expected discounts especially pbm gpo rebates and medicaid rebates  which can be substantial  returns and chargebacks and or slower than expected market penetration 
other setbacks that avinza could face in the sustained release opioid market include product safety and abuse issues  regulatory action  and the inability to obtain sufficient quotas of morphine from the drug enforcement agency to support production requirements 
with respect to regulatory action and product safety issues  the fda previously requested expanded warnings on the avinza label to alert doctors and patients to the dangers of using avinza with alcohol 
changes were made to the label 
the fda also requested clinical studies to investigate the risks associated with taking avinza with alcohol 
any additional warnings  studies and any further regulatory action could have significant adverse effects on avinza sales 
we may not be able to hire and or retain key employees 
if we are unable to hire and or retain key employees  we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage our assets or our business  and we may not be able to perform our obligations under various contracts and commitments 
either of these could have substantial negative impacts on our business and our stock price 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
as a result  you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
many factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including  but not limited to  the following factors results of or delays in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the success of our collaboration agreements  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 
the national association of securities dealers  inc  or nasd  and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  have adopted certain new rules 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new 
table of contents rules  we could be delisted from trading on the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the nasd 
as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 
in march  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  of up to million of shares of our common stock in the open market and negotiated purchases over a period of months 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock in open market transactions at varying prices for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the existence of such a program may contribute to the volatility of the price of our common stock and impact the liquidity of our common stock 
our product development involves a number of uncertainties  and we may never generate sufficient collaborative payments and royalties from the development of products to become profitable 
we were founded in we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
most of our products in development will require extensive additional development  including preclinical testing and human studies  as well as regulatory approvals  before they can be marketed 
we cannot predict if or when any of the products we are developing or those being developed with our partners will be approved for marketing 
there are many reasons why we or our collaborative partners may fail in our efforts to develop our potential products  including the possibility that preclinical testing or human studies may show that our potential products are ineffective or cause harmful side effects  the products may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the fda or foreign authorities in a timely manner  or at all  the products  if approved  may not be produced in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs  the products  if approved  may not achieve commercial acceptance  regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to our products  which could adversely affect their commercial success  or the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our partners from marketing the products 
any product development failures for these or other reasons  whether with our products or our partners products  may reduce our expected revenues  profits  and stock price 
the past restatement of our consolidated financial statements increased the possibility of legal or administrative proceedings 
any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting  our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business 
we determined that our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  and for the first three quarters of  as described in more detail in our annual report on form k  should be restated 
as a result of these events  we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties 
we expect to continue to incur unanticipated accounting and legal costs as noted below 
in addition  the sec has instituted a formal investigation into our restated consolidated financial statements identified above 
this investigation will likely divert more of our management s time and attention and cause us to incur substantial costs 
such investigations can also lead to fines or injunctions or orders with respect to future activities  as well as further substantial costs and diversion of management time and attention 
while no material weaknesses were identified as of december   we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods 
the existence of one or more material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements 
substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that 
table of contents we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  our business and financial condition could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  or the market price of our stock could decline significantly 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  or obtain additional financing on favorable terms  could be materially and adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
moreover  our reputation with customers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others may be adversely affected 
challenges to or failure to secure patents and other proprietary rights may significantly hurt our business 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patents and proprietary rights for our potential products both in the united states and in foreign countries 
patents may not be issued from any of these applications currently on file  or  if issued  may not provide sufficient protection 
our patent position  like that of many biotech and pharmaceutical companies  is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed 
in addition  others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
we have had and will continue to have discussions with our current and potential collaborative partners regarding the scope and validity of our patents and other proprietary rights 
if a collaborative partner or other party successfully establishes that our patent rights are invalid  we may not be able to continue our existing collaborations beyond their expiration 
any determination that our patent rights are invalid also could encourage our collaborative partners to seek early termination of our agreements 
such an invalidation could adversely affect our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we may also need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation occurs  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
in addition  if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others to sign confidentiality agreements when they begin their relationship with us 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets 
our legacy commercial product lines expose us to product liability risks and we may not have sufficient insurance to cover any claims 
we completed the sale of our commercial product lines in february nevertheless  products we sold prior to divesting these product lines expose us to potential product liability risks 
for example  such products may need to be recalled to address regulatory issues 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could result in payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running our business 
in addition  some of the compounds we are investigating may be harmful to humans 
we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for product liability claims 
however  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on commercially reasonable terms  or our insurance may not provide adequate protection in the case of 
table of contents a product liability claim 
to the extent that product liability insurance  if available  does not cover potential claims  we will be required to self insure the risks associated with such claims 
we will have continuing obligations to indemnify the buyers of our commercial product lines  and may be subject to other liabilities related to the sale of our commercial product lines 
in connection with the sale of our avinza product line  we have agreed to indemnify king for a period of months after the closing of the sale of the avinza product line in february for a number of specified matters  including any breach of our representations  warranties or covenants contained in the asset purchase agreement 
in certain defined cases  our obligation to indemnify king extends for a period of months following the closing of the asset sale 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify eisai  the purchaser of our oncology product line  for damages suffered by eisai arising from any breach of our representations  warranties  covenants or obligations in the asset purchase agreement 
our obligation to indemnify eisai extends beyond the closing of the sale of our oncology product line in october up to  in some cases  months or months and  in other cases  until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
in a few instances  our obligation to indemnify eisai survives in perpetuity 
under our agreement with king  million of the total upfront cash payment was deposited into an escrow account to secure our indemnification obligations to king 
as of december   million remained in the king escrow account and million has been released to us 
similarly  our agreement with eisai required that million of the total upfront cash payment be deposited into an escrow account to secure our indemnification obligations to eisai 
as of december   all amounts in the eisai escrow account had been released to us 
under certain circumstances  our liability to king or eisai under the indemnification obligations of the applicable asset purchase agreement may be in excess of the amounts in the applicable escrow accounts 
the asset purchase agreement for the avinza product line also allows king  under certain circumstances  to set off indemnification claims against the royalty payments payable to us  including avinza royalty payments 
under the asset purchase agreements  our exposure for any indemnification claim brought by king or eisai is limited to million and million  respectively 
however  in certain matters  our indemnification obligation is not subject to the foregoing limits on liability 
for example  we are obligated to indemnify king  without limitation  for all liabilities arising under certain agreements with catalent pharma solutions related to the manufacture of avinza 
similarly  we are obligated to indemnify eisai  without limitation  for all liabilities related to certain claims regarding promotional materials for the ontak and targretin drug products 
we cannot predict the liabilities that may arise as a result of these matters 
any claims related to our indemnification obligations to king or eisai could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
we may also be subject to liability for products we recently sold 
for example  in march we received a letter from counsel to salk alleging that we owe salk royalties on prior sales of targretin as well as a percentage of the amounts received from eisai 
salk alleges that it is owed at least of the consideration paid by eisai for the portion of our oncology product line and associated assets attributable to targretin 
in an april  request for mediation  salk repeated these claims and asserted additional claims that increase the amount of royalty buy out payments allegedly owed to salk 
a mediation hearing in june attended by representatives from ligand and salk left the matter unresolved 
in july  salk filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association seeking at least million for alleged breach of contract based on salk s theory that it is entitled to a portion of the money paid by eisai to ligand for targretin related assets 
we do not believe that salk has a valid basis for its claims and intend to vigorously oppose any claim that salk may bring for payment related to these matters 
as previously disclosed  in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which was million as of december  
as organon did not consent to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event king defaults on this obligation 
any successful claim brought against us by salk or others  or any requirement to pay a material amount to organon  could adversely affect our business and the price of our securities 

table of contents if we do not reach the market with our products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses  or if we are not effective in marketing our products  our revenues from product sales  if any  will be reduced 
we face intense competition in our development activities 
many of our competitors are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies  which have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and human resources than we do 
these companies might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products 
in addition  competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us  which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete 
we use hazardous materials  which requires us to incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations 
in connection with our research and development activities  we handle hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
to properly dispose of these hazardous materials in compliance with environmental regulations  we are required to contract with third parties at a substantial cost 
our annual cost of compliance with these regulations is approximately million 
in addition  we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for toxic tort claims 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk or predict the exposure of accidental contamination or injury from the handling and disposing of hazardous materials  whether by us or by our third party contractors 
any accident in the handling and disposing of hazardous materials may expose us to significant liability 
our shareholder rights plan and charter documents may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by the stockholders 
such restrictions and issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you or our other stockholders believe that such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we may lose some or all of the value of some of our short term investments 
we engage one or more third parties to manage some of our cash consistent with an investment policy that allows a range of investments and maturities 
the investments are intended to maintain safety of principal while providing liquidity adequate to meet projected cash requirements 
risks of principal loss is to be minimized through diversified short and medium term investments of high quality  but the investments are not in every case guaranteed or fully insured 
in light of the recent changes in the credit market  one of our short term investments in commercial paper is now in default 
we intend to pursue collection efforts  but we might not recoup some or all of our investment in the commercial paper 
in addition  from time to time we may suffer other losses on our short term investment portfolio 
we may require additional money to run our business and may be required to raise this money on terms which are not favorable or which reduce our stock price 
we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings to fund our operations 
our inability to obtain additional financing could adversely affect our business 
financings may not be available at all or on favorable terms 
in addition  these financings  if completed  may not meet our capital needs and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or drug development programs 
we may also be required to liquidate our business or file for 
table of contents bankruptcy protection 
alternatively  we may be forced to attempt to continue development by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish some or all of our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our drug development programs will require substantial additional future funding which could hurt our operational and financial condition 
our drug development programs require substantial additional capital to successfully complete them  arising from costs to conduct research  preclinical testing and human studies  establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities  and establish and develop quality control  regulatory  marketing  sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs 
our future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors  including the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and human studies  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish additional collaborations  changes in our existing collaborations  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of our commercialization activities 
we expect our research and development expenditures over the next three years to continue to be significant 
however  we base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables 
such uncertainties include regulatory approvals  the timing of events outside our direct control such as product launches by partners and the success of such product launches  negotiations with potential strategic partners  possible sale of assets or other transactions and other factors 
any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements 
while we expect to fund our research and development activities primarily from cash generated from avinza royalties to the extent possible  if we are unable to do so we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings or seek other external means of financing 
these financings could depress our stock price 
if additional funds are required to support our operations and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further development or commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
significant returns of products we sold prior to selling our commercial businesses could harm our operating results 
under our agreements to sell our commercial businesses  we remain financially responsible for returns of our products sold before those businesses were transferred to their respective buyers 
consequently  if returns of those products are higher than expected  we could incur substantial expenses for processing and issuing refunds for those returns which  in turn  could negatively impact our financial results 
the amount of returns could be affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  ongoing product demand  product rotation at distributors and wholesalers  and product stability issues

overview we are an early stage biotech company that focuses on discovering and developing new drugs that address critical unmet medical needs in the areas of thrombocytopenia  anemia  cancer  hormone related diseases  osteoporosis and inflammatory diseases 
we strive to develop drugs that are more effective and or safer than existing therapies  that are more convenient to administer and that are cost effective 
we plan to build a profitable company by generating income from research  milestone and royalty and co promotion revenues resulting from our collaborations with pharmaceutical partners 
on september   we announced the sale of ontak  targretin capsules  targretin gel  and panretin gel to eisai  inc  or eisai  and the sale of avinza to king pharmaceuticals  inc  or king 
the eisai sales transaction subsequently closed on october  the avinza sale transaction subsequently closed on february  accordingly  the results for the oncology and avinza product lines have been presented in our consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
we are a party to a number of collaboration arrangements that are in the development phase  including collaborations with glaxosmithkline  pfizer  tap  and wyeth 
we received funding during the research phase of the arrangements  and milestone and royalty payments as products are developed and marketed by our corporate partners 
see potential future revenue sources below 
in addition  in connection with some of these collaborations  we received non refundable up front payments 
we have been unprofitable since our inception on an annual basis and expect to incur net losses in the future 
to be profitable  we must successfully develop  clinically test  market and sell our products 
even if we achieve profitability  we cannot predict the level of that profitability or whether we will be able to sustain profitability 
we expect that our operating results will fluctuate from period to period as a result of differences in the timing and amounts of revenues  including royalties expected to be earned in the future from king on sales of avinza  expenses incurred  collaborative arrangements and other sources 
some of these fluctuations may be significant 

table of contents potential future revenue sources we may receive royalties on product candidates resulting from our research and development collaboration arrangements with third party pharmaceutical companies if and to the extent any such product candidate is ultimately approved by the fda and successfully marketed 
the company s current product candidates are discussed below 
glaxosmithkline collaboration eltrombopag eltrombopag is an oral  small molecule drug that mimics the activity of thrombopoietin  a protein factor that promotes growth and production of blood platelets 
eltrombopag is a product candidate that resulted from our collaboration with smithkline beecham now glaxosmithkline 
at the european hematology association meeting on june   glaxosmithkline announced positive phase iii data showing increased platelet count and significantly lower incidence of bleeding in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura itp 
glaxosmithkline submitted a new drug application  or nda  for approval to market eltrombopag promacta tm revolade tm on december  two pivotal trials  one phase iii trial and one phase ii trial  were submitted to support the nda submission 
on march   the fda accepted for filing and review glaxosmithkline s nda and granted a priority review status for promacta eltrombopag for treatment of chronic short term itp 
priority review is granted by the fda for a treatment that addresses significant unmet medical needs or has the potential to provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products  and results in a review period of six months from the date of nda submission 
if approved  promacta would be the first oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist therapy for the short term treatment of previously treated patients with chronic itp to increase platelet counts and reduce or prevent bleeding 
eltrombopag is currently in a phase iii trial for the long term treatment of itp 
glaxosmithkline reported positive phase ii data in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with hepatitis c and initiated two phase iii trials in patients with hepatitis c in the fourth quarter of a phase ii study in patients with chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia has been completed and a phase i study is ongoing in patients with sarcoma receiving the adriamycin and ifosfamide regimen 
if annual net sales of eltrombopag are less than million  we will earn a royalty of on such net sales 
if eltrombopag s annual net sales are between million and million  we will earn a royalty of on the portion of net sales between million and million  and if annual net sales are between million and million  we will earn a royalty of on the portion of net sales between million and million 
if annual sales exceed million  we will earn a royalty of on the portion of net sales exceeding million

to date we have received million of milestone payments from glaxosmithkline for these compounds 
in the letter  rockefeller also stated its rejection of the our notice sent to rockefeller on august  to terminate the september  license agreement between us and rockefeller 
on march   we filed a declaratory judgment action against rockefeller in the united states district court for the southern district of california seeking  among other things  a judicial determination that i eltrombopag and the backup compound sb including the use of such compounds do not embody any invention s described or claimed in certain licensed patent rights under the september  license agreement between us and rockefeller  ii rockefeller technical information was not essential to the discovery or development of eltrombopag and the backup compound sb  iii we are not liable for any additional payments under its september  license agreement with rockefeller beyond any payments that we ve already made  and iv the september  license agreement between us and rockefeller was terminated in november  and that subsequent to the termination of such agreement  we are not liable for future payments under such agreement

wyeth collaboration bazedoxifene and bazedoxifene in combination with premarin bazedoxifene viviant is a product candidate that resulted from our collaboration with wyeth 
bazedoxifene is a synthetic drug that was specifically designed to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures while at the same time protecting breast and uterine tissue 
in june  wyeth submitted an nda for bazedoxifene to the fda for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis 
the fda issued an approvable letter for bazedoxifene for this indication in april wyeth received a second approvable letter in december and plans to have further discussions with the fda to discuss the issues raised for the prevention indication 
wyeth also submitted a second nda for bazedoxifene in the us in july for the treatment of osteoporosis and an maa to emea in september for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis 
wyeth announced in january that the fda expects to convene an advisory committee in july to review both the treatment and prevention indications for osteoporosis 
the fda action date for the treatment nda is at the end of may  which is expected to change given the timing of the advisory committee 
wyeth is also developing bazedoxifene in combination with premarin aprela as a progesterone free treatment for menopausal symptoms 
two phase iii studies with bazedoxifene conjugated estrogens aprela  showed reduced number and severity of hot flashes in symptomatic postmenopausal women by up to percent  when compared with placebo 
we previously sold to royalty pharma ag  or royalty pharma  the rights to a total of of net sales of bazedoxifene for a period of ten years following the first commercial sale of each product 
after giving effect to the royalty sale  we will receive of the first million in net annual sales 
if net annual sales are between million and billion  we will receive a royalty of on the portion of net sales between million and billion  and if annual sales exceed billion  we will receive a royalty of on the portion of net sales exceeding billion 
additionally  the royalty owed to royalty pharma may be reduced by one third if net product sales exceed certain thresholds across all indications 
in august and september  we paid salk million and million  respectively  to exercise an option to buy out milestone payments  other payment sharing obligations and royalty payments due on future sales of bazedoxifene 
the submission of aprela nda will trigger an additional option for us to buy out our royalty obligation on future sales of bazedoxifene in combination with premarin to salk 
in april  salk made a claim that there are additional patents issued to salk that increase the amount of royalty buy out payments 
based on the context of the claim  we believe that salk is not raising this claim with respect to the bazedoxifene royalty buy out payment 
pfizer collaboration lasofoxifene lasofoxifene is a product candidate that resulted from our collaboration with pfizer 
in august  pfizer submitted an nda to the fda for lasofoxifene for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women

in february  pfizer announced the receipt of a non approvable letter from the fda for 
table of contents vaginal atrophy 
pfizer has also announced that lasofoxifene is being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis 
in april  pfizer announced completion of the postmenopausal evaluation and risk reduction with lasofoxifene pearl phase iii study with favorable efficacy and safety 
pfizer submitted an nda for osteoporosis treatment on december  under the terms of the agreement between ligand and pfizer  we are entitled to receive royalty payments equal to of net sales of lasofoxifene worldwide for any indication 
we previously sold to royalty pharma the rights to a total of of net sales of lasofoxifene for a period of ten years following the first commercial sale 
accordingly  we will receive approximately of worldwide net annual sales of lasofoxifene 
in march  we paid salk approximately million to buy out royalty payments due on total sales of lasofoxifene for the prevention of osteoporosis 
in connection with pfizer s filing of the supplemental nda in december for the use of lasofoxifene for the treatment of vaginal atrophy  we exercised our option to pay salk million to buy out royalty payments due on sales in this additional indication 
in april  salk made a claim that there are additional patents issued to salk that increase the amount of royalty buy out payments 
based on the context of the claim  we believe that salk is not raising this claim with respect to the lasofoxifene royalty buy out payment 
we have raised a counterclaim in the arbitration with salk seeking either a refund of the two million payments or an offset against any award that may be granted to salk 
tap collaboration lgd lgd  a selective androgen receptor modulator  or sarm  was selected as a clinical candidate during ligand s collaboration with tap

uncertainties include our inability to predict the outcome of complex research  our inability to predict the results of clinical studies  regulatory requirements placed upon us by regulatory authorities such as the fda and emea  our inability to predict the decisions of our collaborative partners  our ability to fund research and development programs  competition from other entities of which we may become aware of in future periods  predictions of market potential from products that may be derived from our research and development efforts  and our ability to recruit and retain personnel or third party research organizations with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform certain research

gain on sale leaseback on october   we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary nexus  entered into an agreement with slough for the sale of our real property located in san diego  california for a purchase price of million 
this property  with a net book value of million  includes one building totaling approximately  square feet  the land on which the building is situated  and two adjacent vacant lots 
as part of the sale transaction  we agreed to lease back the building for a period of years 
the sale transaction subsequently closed on november  in accordance with sfas  accounting for leases  we recognized an immediate pre tax gain on the sale transaction of million in the fourth quarter of and deferred a gain of million on the sale of the building 
the deferred gain is recognized as an offset to operating expense on a straight line basis over the year term of the lease at a rate of approximately million per year 
interest income interest income was million for compared to million for and million for the increases are primarily due to higher cash and investment balances as a result of the proceeds from the sale of the oncology product line in october  the sale and leaseback of the corporate headquarters in november and the sale of the avinza product line in february income taxes we had losses from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations for  and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the income tax benefit generated by the loss from continuing operations in  and was million  and million and million  respectively 
this income tax benefit captures the deemed use of losses from continuing operations used to offset the income and gain from our avinza product line and oncology product line that were sold in and  respectively 
net income tax expense combining both continuing and discontinued operations was million and million for and  respectively 
this expense reflects the net tax due on taxable income for the respective years that was not fully offset by net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards resulting from alternative minimum tax for federal and state tax reporting purposes  and from state income taxes for certain states incurred after full utilization of state net operating loss and research and development credits 
net income tax expense combining both continuing and discontinued operations was million for 
table of contents federal net operating loss carryforwards of million are available to be utilized against future taxable income 
we have no state net operating loss carryforwards 
we have million of federal research and development credit carryforwards 
federal research and development credit carryforwards of million expired at the beginning of with the remainder expiring through  and we have million million net of federal tax of california research and development credits that have no expiration date 
in addition  we have alternative minimum tax carryforwards of million 
due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards have been fully reserved 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited if there were changes in ownership of more than 
we completed a section study for ligand  excluding glycomed  and have determined that ligand had an ownership change in and as a result of these ownership changes  utilization of ligand s net operating losses and credits are subject to limitations under internal revenue code sections and the information necessary to determine if an ownership change related to glycomed occurred prior to its acquisition by ligand is not currently available 
accordingly  such tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards are not reflected in our deferred tax assets 
if information becomes available in the future to substantiate the amount of these nols and credits  we will record the deferred tax assets at such time 
future changes in ownership could result in additional limitations on the utilization of our net operating losses and tax credits under internal revenue code sections and our research and development tax credits pertain to federal and california jurisdictions 
these jurisdictions require that we maintain documentation and support 
we recently completed a formal study and believe that we maintain sufficient documentation to support the amounts of the research and development tax credits discussed above

thereafter  royalties will be paid on a calendar year basis 
royalties on sales of avinza due from king are recognized in the quarter reported by king 
since there is a one quarter lag from when king recognizes avinza net sales to when king reports those sales and the corresponding royalties to the company  the company recognized avinza royalty revenues beginning in the second quarter of the company also generates revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements  and other activities such as distribution agreements  other product royalties  and sales of technology rights

table of contents medicaid rebates the products related to the commercial operations we have sold were subject to state government managed medicaid programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state governments 
we are still obligated to pay for these rebates for products in the distribution channel  which had not sold through at the time of the sale of our commercial operations 
we account for medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of medicaid rebate claims 
we determine our estimate of the medicaid rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding medicaid rebates  as well as current and historical prescription activity provided by external sources  current contract prices and any expected contract changes 
we additionally consider any legal interpretations of the applicable laws related to medicaid and qualifying federal and state government programs and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates 
we adjust the accrual periodically throughout each period to reflect actual experience  expected changes in future prescription volumes and any changes in business circumstances or trends 
in addition  because of the inherent difficulties of predicting the impact on our estimates and assumptions of rapidly evolving state medicaid programs and regulations  we are unable to quantify an estimate of the reasonably likely effect of any such changes on our results of operations or financial position 
for reference purposes  a to variance to our estimated allowance for state medicaid rebates as of december  would result in an approximate million to million adjustment to discontinued operations 
government chargebacks the products related to the commercial operations we have sold were subject to certain programs with federal government entities and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities 
we are still obligated to pay for these chargebacks for products in the distribution channel  which had not sold through at the time of the sale of our commercial operations 
these entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower vendor price  and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower vendor price back to us 
we account for chargebacks by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of chargeback claims 
we determine our estimate of the chargebacks primarily based on historical experience regarding chargebacks and current contract prices under the vendor programs 
we consider vendor payments and our claim processing time lag and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each period to reflect actual experience and any changes in business circumstances or trends 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of government chargebacks  the actual amount of claims for chargebacks may be materially different from our estimates 
for reference purposes  a to variance to our estimated allowance for chargebacks as of december  would result in an approximate million to million adjustment to discontinued operations 
managed health care rebates and other contract discounts we previously offered rebates and discounts on certain products related to the commercial operations we have sold to managed health care organizations and to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations in the us we are still obligated to pay for these rebates and discounts for products in the distribution channel  which had not sold through at the time of the sale of our commercial operations 
we account for managed health care rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of managed health care rebates and other contract discounts 
we determine our estimate of the managed health care rebates and other contract discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices 
we also consider the current and historical prescription activity provided by external sources  current contract prices and any expected contract changes and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each period to reflect actual experience and any changes in business circumstances or trends 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of rebates and contract discounts  the actual amount of claims for rebates and discounts may be materially different from our estimates

table of contents assumptions of rapidly evolving managed care programs  we are unable to quantify an estimate of the reasonably likely effect of any such changes on our results of operations or financial position

product returns in connection with the sale of the company s product lines  the company retained the obligation for returns of product that were shipped to wholesalers prior to the close of the transactions 
the accruals for product returns  which were recorded as part of the accounting for the sales transactions  are based on historical experience 
due to the estimates and assumptions inherent in determining the amount of product returns  we are unable to quantify an estimate of the reasonably likely effect of any such changes on our results of operations or financial position 
for reference purposes  a to variance to our estimated allowance for product returns would result in an approximate million to million adjustment to discontinued operations 
co promote termination accounting as part of the termination and return of co promotion rights agreement that we entered into with organon in january  we agreed to make quarterly payments to organon  effective for the fourth quarter of  equal to of avinza net sales through december  and thereafter through patent expiration  currently anticipated to be november the estimated fair value of the amounts to be paid to organon after the termination million as of january  based on the future estimated net sales of the product  was recognized as a liability and expensed as a cost of the termination as of the effective date of the agreement  january in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which approximated million as of december  
as organon has not consented to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event of king s default of this obligation 
therefore  we recorded an asset on february  to recognize king s assumption of the obligation  while continuing to carry the co promote termination liability in our consolidated financial statements to recognize our legal obligation as primary obligor to organon as required under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this asset represents a non interest bearing receivable for future payments to be made by king and is recorded at its fair value 
as of december  and thereafter  the receivable and liability will remain equal and adjusted each quarter for changes in the fair value of the obligation 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value and assesses the co promote termination receivable for impairment eg in the event king defaults on the assumed obligation to pay organon 
on a quarterly basis  management also reviews the carrying value of the co promote termination liability 
due to assumptions and judgments inherent in determining the estimates of future net avinza sales through november  the actual amount of net avinza sales used to determine the amount of the asset and liability for a particular period may be materially different from current estimates 
any resulting changes to the co promote termination liability will have a corresponding impact on the co promote termination payments receivable 
as of december   the fair value of the co promote termination liability and the corresponding receivable was determined using a discount rate of 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured 
table of contents as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value of our long lived assets is determined using the expected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of december   we believe that the future undiscounted cash flows to be received from our long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate  forfeiture rates and the expected life of the equity instrument 
expected volatility utilized in the model is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock price and other factors 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
the model incorporates forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data 
the expected lives of the and grants are derived in accordance with the safe harbor expected term assumptions under sab no 
prior to january   we accounted for options granted to employees in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we also have certain equipment financing arrangements with variable rates of interest 
due to the relative insignificance of such arrangements  however  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
we do not have a significant level of transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have very limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
