item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all amounts are expressed in canadian dollars unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that are not historical facts but reflect our current expectation regarding future results 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the matters discussed below 
please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchise and company operated restaurants 
as of december    or of our restaurants were franchised  representing in canada and in the united states 
the amount of systemwide sales affects our franchisee royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants 
average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide throughout the relevant period and provides a useful comparison between periods 
we believe systemwide sales and average same store sales provide meaningful information to investors concerning the size of our system  the overall health of the system  and the strength of our brand 
franchise restaurant sales generally are not included in our consolidated financial statements except for restaurants consolidated in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb revised december fin r  however  franchise restaurant sales result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  and also impact distribution revenues 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain certain non gaap financial measures to assist readers in understanding the company s performance 
non gaap financial measures are measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
where non gaap financial measures are used  we have provided the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and a reconciliation to gaap measures 
references herein to tim hortons  the company  we  our  or us refer to tim hortons inc and its subsidiaries  unless specifically noted otherwise 
executive overview we franchise and operate tim hortons restaurants in canada and the us as the franchisor  we collect royalty income on our franchised restaurant sales 
our business model also includes controlling the real estate for most of our franchised restaurants 
as of december   we leased or owned the real estate for approximately of our system restaurants  which generates a recurring stream of rental income 
real estate not controlled by us is generally for non standard restaurants  including  for example  kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  and airports  as well as our more recent self serve kiosks located in gas and convenience locations 
we distribute coffee and other drinks  non perishable food  supplies  packaging and equipment to system restaurants in canada through our five distribution centres 
in the third quarter of  we completed the roll out of distribution of frozen and refrigerated products from our guelph facility  which now services approximately of our ontario restaurants see below 
in the us  we supply similar products to system restaurants through third party distributors 
systemwide sales growth was in fiscal as a result of continued same store sales growth and new restaurant expansion in both canada and the us systemwide sales include restaurant level sales at both franchised and company operated restaurants 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  canadian same store sales growth was  which was lower than our year to date trends mainly due to a combination of factors including strong comparables from  considerable snowfall in key markets during the month of december  as well as the weighting of promotional focus on timcards instead of holiday merchandise 
our successful breakfast sandwich was launched in canada in  and was a contributor to our same store sales growth in in the fourth quarter  we lapped  and in future periods we will be continuing to lap  these significant same store sales numbers 
also  the majority of the timcard holiday orientated sales during the quarter were not reflected in sales performance  which is demonstrated by the million of restricted cash on hand balance as at december  on our consolidated balance sheet 
pricing accounted for approximately of canadian same store sales growth in the fourth quarter of in  our fourth quarter canadian same store sales growth was 
in the us segment  same store sales increased during the fourth quarter of  building upon an increase of in the comparable period of pricing contributed less than a half percent to same store sales growth in the us segment during the quarter 
we were pleased with sales performance in the us given the challenging economic environment and severe winter weather conditions that also affected most of our us market in the fourth quarter of fiscal same store sales increased in canada in fiscal and increased in the us in fiscal 
pricing impacted the full year growth rates by approximately in canada and in the us restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as labour  coffee  and other supplies 
in  we expect our restaurants to have some price increases in certain key canadian markets due to continued minimum wage increases and potentially other cost pressures 
same store sales growth was driven by our promotional calendar  new product offerings  continuous improvement at restaurant level operations  and price increases in some regions of canada and the us  as outlined above 
product innovation continues to be one of our focused strategies to drive same store sales growth  including innovation at breakfast as well as other day parts 
this may include innovation in our lunch offerings  with a planned first half of launch of a hot sandwich  which we see as a natural expansion of our hot breakfast sandwich and other hot lunch offerings 
other planned product launches include a homestyle hash brown  and in the us  combo meal offerings 
we opened a total of restaurants in fiscal compared to restaurants in fiscal our restaurant development program is typically highest in the fourth quarter each year 
we execute our development activities prudently and only with what we believe to be the right opportunities 
this includes our selective development of targeted us markets  including our newest us market  lansing  michigan 
we also continue to pursue strategic alliances with third parties for restaurant development opportunities in the us and canada 
in this regard  we entered into a strategic alliance with operators of a national gasoline retailer in the us to open self serve kiosks in the fourth quarter of these self serve kiosks leverage a tim hortons platform in place in locations in the convenience channel in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  and provide a new avenue for growth while increasing brand exposure 
we anticipate that we will continue to test this new platform in the us market in in addition  we announced a restaurant development arrangement with wal mart canada corp  in canada in the third quarter of under this relationship  we will have restaurants in wal mart canada supercentres with approximately outlets opened by the end of as previously disclosed  future escalation of real estate and construction costs and labour availability in some regions  especially western canada may slow our projected new restaurant growth  and our mix between standard and non standard restaurants may shift toward non standard depending upon real estate availability and market needs  among other factors 
our us self serve kiosk units are included in our us restaurant count  but are not expected to produce the same level of rents and royalties and distribution revenues as other non standard restaurants  and the financial arrangements with our strategic business partners for these ventures may differ from our other typical franchise models 
in fiscal  our revenues increased million  or  over fiscal these increases were primarily a result of continued average same store sales gains and growth in the number of systemwide restaurants  resulting in higher royalty  rental and distribution revenues 
distribution represents the largest 
table of contents portion of our revenues 
distribution sales increased as we completed our implementation of frozen and refrigerated distribution from our guelph  ontario facility in the third quarter of see below 
franchise fees  which are based primarily on restaurant openings  also increased  primarily reflecting a higher number of restaurant resales  renovations and replacements  compared to fiscal the guelph distribution facility commenced operations in the first quarter of in april   we started the transition to three channel delivery from this distribution centre 
three channel delivery has shelf stable  refrigerated and frozen product on the same truck 
this facility now services approximately of our ontario restaurants for shelf stable  refrigerated and frozen products 
during the phase in period for refrigerated and frozen distribution in and the first half of  we faced higher distribution costs without the full benefit of the new distribution revenues 
sales margins on frozen and refrigerated products are typically lower than for some of our other products but have contributed positively to our net income in fiscal distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to control costs to our franchisees and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
operating income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher year over year revenues  discussed above 
operating income gains in fiscal were also realized from higher equity income 
partially offsetting these operating gains were increased operating expenses arising primarily from a higher number of properties that we own or lease and then sublease to franchisees  higher franchise fee costs primarily related to increased franchisee support costs generally associated with establishing and or developing our franchised restaurants  higher general and administrative expenses  higher other expense  which was primarily related to foreign exchange losses  and  lower contribution from our us operating segment 
in fiscal  our net income increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in net income was primarily a result of the higher operating income  partially offset by higher income tax expense 
our net income growth rate of was lower than operating income growth of  due primarily to the higher effective tax rate in fiscal versus fiscal net income in benefited from lower interest expense  primarily as a result of the us million note to wendy s being outstanding for part of fiscal fully repaid in april  but partially offset by lower interest income 
earnings per share increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in fiscal was million  which was higher than the diluted weighted average share count in fiscal  primarily as a result of the company s ipo in march  partially offset by our share repurchase program 
in the fourth quarter of  we substantially completed the installation of electronic payment systems in canada to allow for payment by credit card at approximately  participating restaurant locations 
the company entered into an exclusive arrangement with mastercard for a limited period of time 
in late october  the reloadable timcard was introduced in canada  using the same technology platform as the mastercard payment system 
both initiatives are designed to provide customer convenience and increased speed of service 
we anticipate that the timcard program will be rolled out in the us in the first quarter of the company fully completed its first million share repurchase program in september a total of million shares were repurchased under this program 
in october  our board of directors approved a new twelve month  million share repurchase program as part of our ongoing focus on creating value for shareholders 
we commenced purchasing under this program in november under these two programs  we purchased a total of million shares at an average cost of  for a total cost of million  in fiscal since becoming a public company in march  we have declared and paid six consecutive quarterly dividends of per share  payable in canadian dollars 
in fiscal  we paid million in dividends to our stockholders 
our board of directors has approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per share 
the first payment of a dividend at this new rate is payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  
table of contents commencing in december of  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of wendy s international inc wendy s  and our financial results were consolidated with those of wendy s and its other operating segments 
for our historical financial information  you should refer to the periodic and annual reports filed by wendy s 
in march  we completed an initial public offering ipo pursuant to which public stockholders purchased million shares  or  of our common stock 
wendy s continued to own of our outstanding shares after the ipo and  therefore  our financial results continued to be consolidated with wendy s until september  on september   wendy s completed a spin off of its remaining controlling stake in us  representing approximately million shares of our common stock  by a special pro rata distribution of such shares to its stockholders of record on september  with the completion of this distribution  we have operated as a widely held  standalone public company since september in february  we entered into a senior bank facility borrowing million 
we also entered into revolving credit facilities a million canadian facility and a us million us facility 
these facilities collectively are referred to herein as our credit facilities 
the proceeds from the credit facilities and the ipo were used to repay borrowings from wendy s of us million in two payments in march and april also  in february  we entered into a bridge loan facility that we repaid in may with ipo proceeds and available cash from operations 
the bridge facility terminated upon repayment 
targets and outlook in fiscal  we are targeting same store sales growth of in canada and in the us we have established these growth targets in a climate of challenging macro economic circumstances and competitive activities that might create variability quarter to quarter or potentially impede our ability to achieve these targets 
we continue to focus on growth strategies that have been successful in the past  including menu innovation and operational initiatives  such as our new cashless payment systems and other activities which we believe will help offset the impact of these challenges 
while the us economy has shown signs of a slowdown and the canadian economy may follow  historically  we have proven to be fairly resilient in challenging economic circumstances 
although we are not immune to recessionary impacts  we believe we are well positioned to support customers looking for value without trading off quality 
we do expect  overall  to see more volatility quarter to quarter in the quick service restaurant market sector  which may include reductions in customer visits 
also  we will more likely have a stronger back half of than first half  particularly given the severe winter weather conditions that persisted into january and early february and economic concerns 
in  in certain areas of canada  such as alberta and some of western canada  our franchisees faced and continue to face substantial labour shortages 
we expect the tight labour market to continue to exist in these areas through in addition  in certain regions of canada  minimum wage increases are slated to continue through  increasing pressure on the businesses of our franchisees 
both the labour shortages and wage increases could negatively impact our franchisees operations and ultimately  our revenues 
in  we expect to open to new restaurants in canada and to new restaurants in the us for  us restaurant opening targets reflect a higher number of targeted openings of non standard locations  including potential additional self serve kiosks that we are testing in certain markets 
as stated above  future escalation of real estate and construction costs  labour shortages in some regions  particularly in western canada  and other factors outside of our control  such as local zoning and licensing requirements  may slow this growth see risk factors 
on a systemwide basis  we expect to close to restaurants in the normal course of our business 
we anticipate our total capital expenditures will be between million and million  including capital expenditures for new restaurant development  remodelling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
we anticipate being able to fund these capital expenditures through free cash flow 

table of contents we are targeting operating income growth of in over we estimate that our effective tax rate will be between  subject to some quarterly variations 
these financial targets are annual targets only  which replace and supersede all previous targets established by the company  including our previously announced long term same store sales growth targets for the us and canada 
however  our previously announced us and canadian long term restaurant development targets remain in place 
these long term development targets are for restaurants in the us by year end  and  to  restaurants in canada over the longer term 
these targets are forward looking and are based on our expectations and outlook and shall be effective only as of the date the targets were originally issued 
except as required by applicable securities laws  we do not intend to update our annual financial targets 
these targets and our performance generally is subject to various risks and uncertainties risk factors which may impact future performance and our achievement of these targets

this change will align same store calculation methodologies between canada and the us  and with industry practices 
we do not expect this adjustment to have a significant impact on reported canadian same store sales 
systemwide sales growth our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchised and company operated restaurants  although approximately of our system is franchised 
systemwide sales impact our franchise royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution sales 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants 
average same store sales growth average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide ie  includes both franchised and company operated 
table of contents restaurants throughout the relevant period and provides a useful comparison between periods 
our average same store sales growth is typically attributable to several key factors  including new product introductions  improvements in restaurant speed of service or other operational efficiencies  more frequent customer visits  expansion into broader menu offerings  and pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as coffee  labour  and other supplies

such adjustments will be provided in our form q for the first quarter of for us restaurants  a restaurant is included in our average same store calculation beginning in the th month following the restaurant s opening 
our canadian fourth quarter same store sales growth rates were lower than our year to date trends due to a combination of factors described above under executive overview 
our historical average same store sales trends are not necessarily indicative of future results 

table of contents new restaurant development opening restaurants in new and existing markets in canada and the us has been a significant contributor to our growth 
below is a summary of restaurant openings and closures for our   and fiscal years fiscal year end canada restaurants opened restaurants closed net change us restaurants opened restaurants closed net change total company restaurants opened restaurants closed net change from the beginning of to the end of fiscal  we opened system restaurants including both franchised and company operated restaurants  net of restaurant closures 
typically  to system restaurants are closed annually  the majority of which are in canada 
restaurant closures typically result from an opportunity to acquire a better location  which will permit us to upgrade size and layout or add a drive thru 
we have also closed  and may continue to close  restaurants for which the restaurant location has performed below our expectations for an extended period of time  and or we believe that sales from the restaurant can be absorbed by surrounding restaurants 

table of contents the following table shows our restaurant count as of the end of fiscal  and and provides a breakdown of our company operated and franchised restaurants 
our system includes over  restaurants across canada and the us at december    restaurants  or  were franchised restaurants representing in canada and in the us systemwide restaurant count fiscal year end canada company operated franchise total franchised us company operated franchise total franchised total system company operated franchise total franchised segment operating income loss systemwide sales and average same store sales growth are affected by a variety of factors  including the business and economic environments in canada and the us we manage and review financial results from canadian and us operations separately 
we  therefore  have determined the reportable segments for our business to be the geographic locations of canada and the us each segment includes all manufacturing and distribution operations that are located in their respective geographic locations

fiscal compared to fiscal segment operating income increased million  or  for fiscal over our canadian segment operating income increased by million  or 
canadian average same store sales increased over the prior year  of which pricing contributed of this increase 
we opened new system restaurants in and closed restaurants 
in  our us operating segment had an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million 
the decrease in the us segment operating income was primarily due to the following factors increased relief given to franchisees  particularly as we transition more company operated restaurants to franchisees or operator agreements  higher general and administrative expenses  as resources have been added to replace services previously provided by wendy s  lower income from coffee roasting operations  due primarily to foreign exchange fluctuations in the first quarter that are not expected to recur  lower franchise fee income  due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition from our franchise incentive program  and higher company operated restaurant losses 
us average same store sales growth was in  of which pricing contributed of this increase 
we are targeting to have restaurants in the us by the end of fiscal  of which we had at the end of fiscal in fiscal  we opened restaurants in the us and closed restaurants 
our restaurant openings included self serve kiosks  which were part of a strategic alliance with an operator of a national gasoline retailer in the us in  we continued to reduce our us company operated restaurant base from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal this shift is part of our longer term strategy of having a primarily franchised system model  similar to our canadian operations 
particularly in our newer markets in the us  the progression to our franchise based model has initially resulted in higher franchise support costs  primarily in the area of rents  royalties and other relief and may increase the number of restaurants that we are required to consolidate in accordance with fin r 
we anticipate that us segment operating income will continue to show volatility  quarter to quarter and year to year  as we continue our growth and expansion into new and existing markets 
as we enter new markets  average unit sales volumes for our franchisees may be lower than sales levels in our more established markets 
in addition  based on our past experience  as we add new restaurants in these developing markets  average unit sales growth for existing restaurants may be affected for a period of time until awareness of the brand improves and the market adjusts to the added convenience that new locations provide 
in certain situations  we provide relief in the areas of rents and royalties  and in some cases  relief on other operating costs  for a period of time to support these franchisees 
the relief offsets our rents and royalties revenue 
also  when we transition a restaurant from a 
table of contents company owned restaurant to either a full franchised restaurant or a restaurant governed by an operator agreement  we generally provide relief to the franchisee for an initial period 
we are generally able to identify franchisees for new restaurants  but in certain developing markets  it may be more challenging  however  it has not historically been a major impediment to our growth 
in  we do not believe that the us segment will be a significant contributor to our consolidated operating income 
corporate charges primarily include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units and the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase reflects a year over year change in foreign exchange expense due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  higher costs associated with our franchisee convention  higher standalone company costs and general growth in our business  partially offset by lower restricted stock unit expenses  and lower costs because the spin off from wendy s in did not recur in  including the costs of a run off directors and officers liability insurance policy 
overall  our total segment operating income from our reportable segments was and as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the overall margin decline was driven primarily by reduced profitability in our us business 
the company  through a wholly owned irish subsidiary  in partnership with cuisine de france and spar ratoath  co meath  ireland has launched coffee and donut self serve kiosks in spar convenience stores in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom 
the self serve kiosks  which feature our premium coffee  tea  specialty hot beverages and a selection of donuts and muffins  were tested and introduced in the first half of as of december   there were self serve kiosk locations in spar locations in the republic of ireland and in the united kingdom 
the roll out is being managed by cuisine de france  under license from tim hortons  and the kiosks are operated by independent spar retailers 
at present  the distribution of coffee and donuts through spar with respect to these self serve kiosks is not expected to be a material contributor to our net income  although it will result in incremental warehouse sales and royalties 
in addition  we are engaging in certain other international test market activities 
see international operations in part i of this annual report 
the operating income from these combined international operations was trivial in fiscal nil  and was netted in corporate charges because  at this time  these ventures are being managed corporately 
our financial arrangements for these self serve kiosks are different than our traditional franchise models  and we may not  therefore  collect similar data or include these locations in certain of our metrics  including same store sales 
compared to segment operating income increased million  or  for fiscal over our canadian segment operating income increased by million  or 
canadian average same store sales increased over the prior year  and we opened new system restaurants in and closed restaurants 
in  our us operating segment had operating income of million  compared to a operating loss of million 
we believe this was attributable to stronger same store sales growth and stronger operational performance in in addition  in fiscal  we had million in store closure costs relating to the new england market that negatively impacted the us operating segment results 
also  same store growth was in  of which pricing contributed of this increase 
in fiscal  we opened stores in the us and closed restaurants 
overall  our total segment operating income from our reportable segments as a percent of total revenues was  for fiscal and  respectively 
our relationship with wendy s in march  we entered into various agreements with wendy s that defined our relationship in the interim period between our ipo and our separation from wendy s  as well as with respect to various post separation matters 
these agreements included a master separation agreement  a shared services agreement  a tax sharing agreement and a registration rights agreement  the latter of which effectively expired upon the spin off from wendy s 

table of contents in  we used information technology services from wendy s relating to our general ledger and us fixed asset repository system 
charges for these services totalled million in and were based on the charges outlined in the shared services agreement  which reduced as the required service levels declined 
we terminated all services from wendy s under the agreement in december  after the implementation of our own standalone general ledger and us fixed asset repository system  although selected provisions of the agreement survive termination  including certain indemnification and limitation of liability clauses 
commencing with the implementation of our new systems  our general and administrative costs include depreciation and other costs for hosting and support services for our new general ledger and fixed asset repository 
in  we incurred million of expense allocations based on the provisions of the shared services agreement with wendy s  excluding costs related to wendy s restricted stock units 
we were a wholly owned subsidiary of wendy s for many years  and as such  we and wendy s historically shared many internal administrative resources 
the shared services agreement was designed to help us and wendy s transition to being two separate public companies  each with its own administrative resources 
under the shared services agreement  prior to september  wendy s provided us services relating to corporate functions such as executive oversight  risk management  internal audit  information technology  accounting  legal  investor relations  human resources  tax  employee benefits and incentives and other services 
consistent with the terms of the shared services agreement  the charges in fiscal and were reduced to reflect the increasing independence of the company and  therefore  the decreased level of services being provided by wendy s  primarily in the areas of executive oversight  investor relations  treasury  financial reporting and information systems 
we considered these general corporate expense allocations  as adjusted pursuant to agreement by wendy s and us as just described  to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided 
the allocations may not  however  reflect the expense we would have incurred as a standalone public company for the same or similar services 
prior to entering into the shared services agreement with wendy s in  estimates of the benefits of similar services received in were carved out for comparative financial reporting purposes 
in fiscal  we incurred million of carve out costs from wendy s  excluding costs related to wendy s restricted stock units and options 
in preparation for the spin off on september   we added most of the infrastructure necessary to be a standalone public company 
we added resources in the financial reporting  treasury  corporate governance and securities law areas 
during  we continued to add resources as required  particularly in the areas of taxation  legal  internal audit  investor relations  and information technology  among others 
our independence from wendy s did not materially harm our relationships with our customers or suppliers or otherwise cause significant changes in our results of operations and business trends when compared to prior years  except for higher costs associated with our ipo and spin off  costs associated with being a public company  and costs incurred as we added resources to perform services provided by wendy s under the shared services agreement  offset in part by lower shared services costs from wendy s 
wendy s received a favourable tax ruling from the canada revenue agency under section of the income tax act canada in connection with the tax impact of the distribution of our shares to wendy s canadian stockholders 
wendy s also received a ruling from the internal revenue service  for us federal income tax purposes  confirming that no gain or loss will be recognized by wendy s and that the distribution of our common stock would be tax free to wendy s us stockholders  except in respect of cash received in lieu of fractional share interests 
we also continue to have some interdependencies with wendy s with respect to income taxes see income taxes

rents and royalties revenues consist of i royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales and ii rents  which consist of base and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us  and typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales 
franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and restaurants on average in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to fin r 
franchise restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues 
the reported franchise restaurant sales were fiscal years franchise restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars 
table of contents revenues sales in fiscal  sales were  million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal our sales include warehouse sales  sales from company operated restaurants  and sales from restaurants required to be consolidated under fin r 
warehouse sales increased million  or  driven primarily by a million increase due to a higher number of restaurants opened and same store sales increases 
the distribution of frozen and refrigerated products increased warehouse sales by million in as compared to product mix and price increases also contributed to the higher distribution revenues 
the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of our us business partially offset these increases see below 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal this change in revenues mix has an impact on overall margins since margins on frozen and refrigerated products are lower than some of the other products we distribute  but contribute positively to our operating income 
company operated restaurant sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants in in  on average  we operated company restaurants compared to company operated restaurants in on occasion  we may open more company operated restaurants when we enter new markets  and we may also repurchase restaurants from existing franchisees and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is impacted by the type of restaurant standard or non standard and the timing of these events throughout the year 
during fiscal  we have transitioned many of our us company operated restaurants to either franchise or operator agreements 
while this may have the effect of lowering our sales from company operated restaurants  many of these restaurants meet the criteria set out in fin r  thus requiring us to consolidate some of these restaurants under these rules 
as a result  we have increased the number of restaurants consolidated under fin r see below 
in addition  restaurants operating under operator agreements often qualify for increased support  primarily in the area of rent and royalties relief see franchise revenues below 
the consolidation under fin r of and restaurants  on average  during fiscal and resulted in sales of million and million  respectively 
sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during fiscal reduced the value of reported sales by approximately compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement 
franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  in fiscal over and are consistent with the systemwide sales growth of 
our net growth in both rental income and royalty income is driven primarily by a million increase due to the positive average same store sales growth over this time period and an increase of million from the addition of a net of system restaurants 
as mentioned previously  stronger same store sales growth was driven by new product offerings  our promotional calendar  continuous improvement in store level operations and some price increases 
price increases are typically used to offset higher costs at the restaurant level  typically for labour and food costs 
as new restaurants open and average same store sales at existing restaurants increase  both our royalty and rental income from franchisees increase because these are typically both based on a percentage of sales 
higher rent and royalty relief provided to certain us and canadian franchisees impacted rents and royalties revenues during the year 
franchise fees 
franchise fees during fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the year over year increase is primarily attributable to franchise fees generated from higher resales  replacements and renovations of million 
a replacement refers to a site change that results in a rebuild within a one 
table of contents kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
in addition  in the us  we have a franchise incentive program whereby franchise fee revenues are deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognition of franchise fees and impacted franchise fee revenues in we opened restaurants in as compared to restaurants in we opened a higher number of non standard restaurants in the us in  including self serve kiosks 
in  we opened a higher number of non standard restaurants in canada 
non standard restaurants include kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  universities and office buildings and typically have lower initial franchise fees

total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or compared to fiscal our cost of sales includes warehouse cost of sales  cost of sales from company operated restaurants  and cost of sales from restaurants required to be consolidated under fin r 
this increase was primarily driven by an increase in warehouse cost of sales of million  or  during the year 
of this increase  million was due to the increased cost of product and operating costs from frozen and some refrigerated product distribution and our dry goods distribution from the guelph facility  and million resulted from an increase in the number of restaurants opened and same store sales increases 
product mix and cost increases also contributed to increased cost of sales 
these increases were partially offset by foreign exchange impacts from the translation of expenses of our us operations from us dollars to canadian dollars see below 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as mentioned above  this shift in business mix is primarily attributable to the distribution of frozen and some refrigerated products from our guelph distribution facility 
now that our transition to three channel delivery is complete  warehouse sales as a percentage of revenues  for that portion related to frozen and refrigerated distribution  is expected to stabilize 
our distribution business will continue to be subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  sugar  etc 
these cost changes can impact warehouse revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
company operated restaurant cost of sales  which includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  varies with the average number and mix eg  size  standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a decrease of  on average  in the number of company operated restaurants open during the year 
the consolidation of and restaurants  on average  under fin r during fiscal and  respectively  resulted in cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
cost of sales of fin r restaurants were impacted by restaurant mix eg size  location  type and foreign exchange 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during fiscal over reduced the value of reported cost of sales by approximately 

table of contents operating expenses total operating expenses  representing primarily rent expense  depreciation and property costs  increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which was an increase of 
our canadian operations contributed the majority of the change with an increase of million in rent expense  depreciation and other property costs during the year 
rent expense increased million due to higher percentage rent costs on certain properties resulting from increased systemwide sales and an increase of properties being leased and then subleased to franchisees in canada in as at december   there were  properties leased by us in canada and then subleased to franchisees  compared to  such properties in fiscal operating expenses will increase in the future as the number of properties we lease from third parties for restaurant sites grows for existing and new leased properties where we pay percentage rent to third parties 
operating expenses will also increase as a result of higher depreciation expense from a higher number of system restaurants 
systemwide sales increases will also increase future operating expenses 
in addition  higher research and development costs in the area of new store design and higher store closure costs contributed to the year over year increase 
operating expenses from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar between fiscal and reduced the value of operating expenses by approximately compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement 
franchise fee costs franchise fee costs increased million  or  from fiscal  of which the majority of this increase was a result of higher resales  replacements and renovations of restaurants  which is consistent with the increase in franchise revenues noted above 
our non standard restaurants including self serve kiosks typically have lower franchise fee costs than standard locations 
in addition  increased support costs and expenses to support a franchisee s business  generally associated with establishing and or developing our franchised restaurants  increased year over year franchise fee costs 
franchise fee costs from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
this expense category also includes charges from wendy s for the periods in which we received services from them  in accordance with the shared services agreement 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed revenue growth 
we do  however  anticipate continuing to add resources throughout  as required to support growth in our business and to support further requirements associated with being a standalone public company 
there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to timing or certain other events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal shared services costs from wendy s were lower in by million 
these lower costs were offset by higher salaries and benefits as we added resources to be a standalone public company  notwithstanding lower equity based compensation rsu costs in in addition to higher salaries and benefits  we incurred higher costs related to new information technology systems  insurance  legal costs  investor relations and shareholder costs  all of which were incurred as a result of us being a standalone public company 
in  we also incurred costs related to our franchisee convention and incurred higher costs related to us advertising and marketing 
costs related to stock based compensation were million lower than in the stock based compensation costs included the accelerated vesting of the wendy s restricted stock units to our executives and certain other employees as a result of our spin off from wendy s 

table of contents our human resources and compensation committee committee has recently advised that there will be some changes to the long term incentive or equity compensation program in for our executive officers  as follows i we will continue to issue restricted stock units  but they will be conditional on the achievement of performance objectives over the prior fiscal year p rsus  and ii we will commence an option program with linked or tandem stock appreciation rights sars 
awards of p rsus  subject to the achievement of performance objectives  and options sars are expected to be granted in may of each year  subject in each case to the discretion of the committee 
as a result  we expect that these changes to the long term equity incentive program will impact compensation expense commencing in the second quarter of we will provide additional details regarding the expected extent of the impact  when available

equity income equity income relates to income from equity investments in joint ventures and other investments over which we exercise significant influence 
our two most significant equity investments are our joint venture with iaws group plc which provides our system with par baked donuts  timbits and some bread products  and our timwen partnership  which leases canadian tim hortons wendy s combination restaurants to both tim hortons and wendy s restaurants of canada inc in fiscal  equity income was million  an increase of million from fiscal  primarily as a result of discrete tax benefits at one of our joint ventures  operating gains at both of our key joint ventures and  a gain on the sale of excess land 
from time to time  our joint venture partners may sell properties that may result in gains or losses 
we do not expect tax benefits of a similar nature in as we have previously disclosed  we do not expect that our equity income will necessarily grow at the same rate as our systemwide sales 
our bakery joint venture provides bakery products which do not necessarily have the same growth rate as total systemwide sales 
our timwen partnership is expected to grow at a slower rate as we are unlikely to add a significant number of new properties to this venture in the future 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  includes amounts that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
this includes gains and losses on asset sales  expenses related to restaurant closures  other asset write offs  foreign exchange gains and losses and minority interest of variable interest entities consolidated in accordance with fin r 
in fiscal  other expense  net  was million versus million of other expense  net in fiscal the million net increase was a result of foreign exchange losses primarily related to us dollar cash and other net assets held in some of our canadian functional currency entities

the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar between fiscal and reduced the value of other expense  net  by approximately compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement 
interest expense including affiliated interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million is primarily due to higher interest rates on our term debt which was outstanding for all of and higher interest on capital leases 

table of contents affiliated interest expense was million in  as a result of the us million note to wendy s that was repaid in march and april the us million note to wendy s had a per annum interest rate 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  resulting in a decrease of million  primarily due to lower average cash balances on hand in and the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar between fiscal and  which reduced interest income by approximately 
in  our cash balances were higher because we had ipo proceeds on hand in investment accounts pending their full utilization 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes provisions for us and canadian taxes 
prior to the period ended september   the date of the spin off  our us entities were included in the filing of a consolidated us tax return with wendy s and its other subsidiaries 
our us entities now file a separate consolidated us federal income tax return commencing for all periods ending after september  our and us income tax provision and related deferred income tax amounts were determined as if we filed tax returns on a standalone basis and were adjusted in accordance with the tax sharing agreement with wendy s 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in in  our effective tax rate was higher as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin and a related provision for uncertain tax positions of million recorded during the year 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was lower as a result of the favourable resolution of tax audits and the benefit of lower taxes on non us earnings and related tax credits 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to in  although some volatility may be experienced between quarters 
the determination of income tax expense takes into consideration amounts that may be needed to cover exposure for open tax years 
the canada revenue agency is currently conducting an examination of various canadian subsidiaries of the company for and subsequent taxation years 
the internal revenue service has concluded its examination of the wendy s consolidated tax group for the year which includes the company up to september  we do not currently expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years  however  actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of approximately million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
additional amounts recognized in fiscal for tax positions related to the current and prior years  net of reductions for tax positions of prior years and settlements made for the year was approximately million

affiliated interest expense was million in  which was million lower than fiscal as a result of affiliate debt outstanding during and net settled in the fourth quarter of along with the us million note to wendy s entered into at the end of the third quarter of the us note to wendy s had a per annum interest rate

we used the net proceeds from our ipo to repay the remainder of that note 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  resulting in an increase of million  primarily due to changes in average cash balances in part resulting from the proceeds from our ipo that remained on hand prior to it being used ie  higher cash on hand balances and higher interest rates earned on cash on hand

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity has historically been  and continues to be  cash generated from canadian operations which has self funded our operations  growth in new restaurants  capital expenditures  dividends  share repurchases  acquisitions and investments during the last five years 
our us operations have historically been a net user of cash  and we expect this trend to continue in our canadian and us revolving credit facilities provide additional sources of liquidity  if needed 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new store construction  renovations of existing restaurants  and general corporate needs 
in addition  we utilize cash to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 
historically  our annual working capital needs have not been significant because of our focused management of accounts receivable and inventory 
in each of the last five fiscal years  operating cash flows have fully funded our capital expenditure requirements for new restaurant development  remodelling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
in fiscal  we expect to open to new restaurants in canada and to new restaurants in the us in  however  the cost and availability of real estate and construction costs  including the cost and availability of labour required for construction of our restaurants in certain areas where we sought to develop restaurants  such as alberta and other areas of western canada  were limiting factors to our growth in these regions 
we anticipate that these conditions are likely to persist through in selective regions of canada 
in the fiscal year  we generated million of cash from operations  as compared to cash generated from operations of million in fiscal  for a net change of million see comparative cash flows below 
we believe that we will continue to generate adequate operating cash flows to fund both our capital expenditures and expected debt service requirements over the next twelve months 
if additional funds are needed for strategic initiatives or other corporate purposes  we believe we could borrow additional funds while maintaining a strong capital structure 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited by our financial and other covenants under our credit facilities  as described below under credit facilities 
any such borrowings may result in an increase in our borrowing costs 
if such additional borrowings are significant  our capital structure could be weakened  and it is possible that we would not be able to borrow on terms which are acceptable 
additionally  our ability to issue additional equity is constrained for some time because our issuance of additional shares is a factor that could be considered relevant to a determination related to the wendy s spin off transaction under section of the internal revenue code and  under the tax sharing agreement  we would be required to indemnify wendy s against the taxes payable if our issuance of shares resulted in a gain being recognized 
when evaluating our leverage position  we look at metrics that consider the impact of long term operating and capital leases as well as other long term debt obligations 
we believe this provides a more meaningful measure of our leverage position given our significant investments in real estate 
at december   included in long term obligations  we had approximately million in term debt and capital leases on our balance sheet 
we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet provides us with opportunity and flexibility for future growth while still enabling us to return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of our share repurchase program and dividends 
in fiscal  we fully completed our million stock repurchase program 
in october  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to purchase up to million of common stock  not to exceed  or  of our outstanding shares as at the time of regulatory approval 
we authorized the commencement of the program on october   after receipt of all regulatory approvals 
the program is expected to be in place until october   but may terminate earlier if the million maximum or the of outstanding common shares limit is reached  or  at the discretion of the board of directors  subject to the company s compliance with regulatory requirements 
the company may make such repurchases on the new york stock exchange nyse and or the toronto stock exchange tsx 
on october   we announced that a notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid ncib would 
table of contents be filed with the tsx for the program  as described above 
regulatory approval from the tsx for the ncib was received on october  for a significant portion of the repurchase program  we entered into a rule b repurchase plan  which allows us to purchase stock at times when we may not otherwise do so due to regulatory or company restrictions 
purchases are based on the parameters of the rule b plan 
at present  we also intend to make repurchases at management s discretion under this program from time to time  subject to market conditions  share price  cash position  and compliance with regulatory requirements 
we spent million to repurchase million shares under these two programs in fiscal since initiation of the share repurchase programs  we have purchased million shares for a total cost of million 
we have funded all of these repurchases to date from our free cash flow  and we expect that all future purchases made under the program will be funded from cash from operations as well 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totalling million 
in fiscal  we paid two quarterly dividends of per share  totalling million 
as disclosed earlier  our board of directors has approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per share  and the first payment of a dividend at this new rate is payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  we have historically paid for all dividends from free cash flow generated from our operations  and we expect to continue to do so in  if additional dividends are  in fact  declared by our board of directors 
our payout ratio range is of prior year  normalized net income  which is net income adjusted for non recurring items  such as tax impacts not expected to recur  that affect our net income based on our year end results 
notwithstanding our payout ratio range and the recent increase in our dividend  the declaration and payment of all future dividends remains subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the company s continued financial performance  debt covenant compliance and other risk factors 
our payout ratio considers our free cash flow and has been benchmarked against companies in the north american quick serve restaurant sector and premier canadian retail companies 
this dividend increase brings the dividend to the high end of our payout ratio range 
in the third quarter of  we distributed a note denominated in us dollars to wendy s in the principal amount of us million billion  which bore interest at an annual rate of and was due on demand 
in early march  we paid wendy s approximately us million of accrued interest  and us million of principal  with proceeds from the million term loan component of our credit facilities  the million bridge loan facility  and from available cash 
the net proceeds of our ipo were used to repay the remaining portion of the us million note to wendy s in april we further used the remaining ipo proceeds and available cash from operations to repay the million bridge loan  which resulted in a termination of the facility 
in  we established an employee benefit trust 
this trust holds shares of our common stock that will be used to satisfy our obligation to settle rsus granted to certain canadian employees 
by establishing this trust  we are able to fix the amount of cash required to satisfy rsu obligations that vest in a future period at approximately the same dollar value at which the rsus were originally granted 
in fiscal and  the trust purchased million shares and million shares  respectively  of our common stock on the open market for a total cost of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the trust settled rsu obligations with the majority of the company s canadian employees by disbursing million shares from the trust  with a total value of million  after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements 
in fiscal  rsu obligations to us employees and directors were settled with treasury shares  after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements 
total borrowings  as well as cash and cash equivalents  as presented in our consolidated financial statements  are not representative of the debt or cash and cash equivalents that have followed our separation from wendy s 
historically  wendy s centrally managed its capital structure in order to optimize its costs of funding and financial flexibility at the corporate level 
consequently  the debt being carried in our historical consolidated financial statements does not necessarily reflect our debt capacity and financing requirements 

table of contents since until our ipo on march   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of wendy s 
accordingly  we did not seek significant external financing as we received funding in various forms from wendy s 
wendy s primarily used a worldwide centralized approach to cash management and the financing of operations 
types of transactions between us and wendy s included i transfers of cash from our us operations to wendy s bank account on a regular basis  ii net cash borrowings from wendy s used to fund us operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and for other purposes  iii payment of related party dividends and interest to wendy s on a regular basis generated from our canadian operations  and iv allocations of corporate expenses 
credit facilities on february  as amended on april   effective february   we entered into unsecured credit facility agreements referred to herein as our credit facilities  which are guaranteed by us and certain of our other subsidiaries and which may be drawn by us or one of our principal subsidiaries 
our credit facilities entered into on such date consisted of the following a five year senior bank facility referred to herein as the senior bank facility that consists of a million term loan  a million canadian revolving credit facility which includes million overdraft availability  and a us million us revolving credit facility  and a million fourteen month bridge loan facility referred to herein as the bridge loan facility 
the bridge loan facility was repaid in april as of december   the million term debt was outstanding and the revolvers were undrawn  except for approximately million being used to support standby letters of credit 
the senior bank facility  consisting of the term loan and two revolvers  matures on february  the term loan bears interest at bankers acceptances plus a margin 
the senior bank facility as amended on april   effective february  contains various covenants which  among other things  require the maintenance of two financial ratios a consolidated maximum total debt to earnings before interest expenses  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants on december  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated maximum debt coverage ratio is computed as consolidated total debt divided by net income before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and net of extraordinary non cash losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business 
consolidated total debt the numerator primarily includes all liabilities for borrowed money  capital lease obligations  letters of credit whether or not related to borrowed money  the net marked to market under swap agreements and guarantee liabilities 
the minimum fixed charge coverage is computed as net income before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  rent expense  and net of extraordinary non cash losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business  collectively as the numerator  divided by consolidated fixed charges 
consolidated fixed charges includes interest and rent expense 
in connection with the term loan facility  we entered into million of interest rate swaps in march  and june with multiple financial institutions to help manage our exposure to interest rate volatility see item a interest rate risk 
the senior bank facility contains certain covenants that will limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  create liens  merge with other entities  sell assets  make restricted payments  make

we will use the borrowings under the revolving portions  if drawn  of the senior bank facility for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions and other business initiatives 
comparative cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in operating cash flows in fiscal increased by million due primarily to higher earnings  lower tax payments  lower payments to wendy s  and  the cash settlement of outstanding hedges that did not recur in tax payments in connection with the resolution of canadian tax audits and interest payments  excluding amounts paid to or received from wendy s  were lower by million in in addition  in fiscal  we paid million to settle certain hedging arrangements 
other factors contributing to higher cash generated from operations included an increase in depreciation and amortization and differences in working capital relating to timing and growth in accounts payables  commensurate with the growth in the business 
the higher depreciation expense primarily reflects depreciation expense from new restaurant development in late  and  accelerated depreciation related to planned restaurant closures and to research and development of new restaurant design  and  depreciation related to new information technology systems 
net cash provided from operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in operating cash flows in fiscal declined by million due primarily to timing differences in working capital driven by tax payments  interest payments  payments to wendy s and the cash settlement of outstanding hedges

other factors contributing to lower cash generated from operations was lower net receipts from wendy s of million  as well as differences in working capital relating to growth in accounts receivable  commensurate with the growth in the business  payments of accrued taxes  discussed above  and inventory 
inventory has increased  in part  as a result of the addition of frozen distribution from our guelph facility 
partially offsetting these operating cash flow declines was net income  net of amortization and depreciation expense and goodwill and asset impairment  which was higher in fiscal compared to investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
we spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal and had other net investing activities of approximately million  primarily comprised of the issuance of new notes receivables  offset by the principal repayments of notes receivable

in  we began to contribute up to of the funding required for certain renovation costs on property that we own or lease  not including equipment replacements  upgrades  and certain other improvements and fixtures  with the franchisee paying the remaining portion of the renovation costs 
this is an increase from approximately one third of the percentage of total costs which we contributed in the past several years

we purchase certain products in the normal course of business  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices 
included in the purchase obligations outlined above are commitments relating to the following commodities green coffee  sugar  palm soybean oil and wheat 
some of these purchase commitments are made on behalf of third party suppliers and one of our joint venture partners 
we generally purchase six to twelve months forward in these commodities 
we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including setting fixed prices with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
in general  we do not have contracts with our suppliers of commodities that extend greater than twelve months 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we have guaranteed certain leases and debt payments of franchisees amounting to million 
in the event of default by a franchisee  we generally retain the right to acquire possession of the related restaurants 
we are also the guarantor on million in letters of credit and surety bonds with various 
table of contents parties  however  we do not expect any significant loss to result from these instruments because we do not believe performance will be required 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
at december   our reserves for doubtful receivables and possible losses on notes receivable totalled million 
these reserves are included in accounts receivable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december  as that term is described by the sec

franchise fee costs includes costs of equipment sold to franchisees as part of the commencement of their restaurant business  as well as training and other costs necessary to ensure a successful restaurant opening 
general and administrative expenses includes costs that cannot be directly related to generating revenue  including expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions  allocation of expenses related to corporate functions and services historically provided to us by wendy s and depreciation of office equipment  the majority of our information technology systems  and head office real estate 

table of contents equity income includes income from equity investments in joint ventures and other minority investments over which we exercise significant influence 
equity income from these investments is considered to be an integrated part of our business operations and is  therefore  included in operating income 
income amounts are shown as reductions to total costs and expenses 
goodwill and asset impairment represents non cash charges relating to the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
other income and expense includes expenses income that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
expenses include restaurant closure costs  currency adjustments  real estate sales  minority interest related to the consolidation of restaurants pursuant to fin r  and other asset write offs 
comprehensive income represents the change in our net assets during the reporting period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
it includes net income and other comprehensive income such as foreign currency translation adjustments and the impact of cash flow hedges 
the application of critical accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies  including our critical accounting policies  in note of our audited historical consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and may require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of our operations 
these assumptions and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates and judgments are inherent in  but not limited to the following the estimation of the collectibility of royalty and other franchise related revenue  legal obligations  income taxes  insurance liabilities  various other commitments and contingencies  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  inventory valuation  gift certificate and cash card breakage  and  property and equipment including the estimation of the useful lives of property and equipment and other long lived assets 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time  actual results could vary from these assumptions or had different assumptions been used 
the company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates based on new events occurring  additional information being obtained or more experience being acquired 
in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which also requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
we may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
basis of presentation in fiscal and  we received charges from wendy s based on the terms of the shared services agreement 
these charges were consistent with the basis of charges received in fiscal  but under the shared services agreement  they declined over and  reflective of our increasing independence from wendy s over this period 
in fiscal  the services we received from wendy s were limited to information technology 
table of contents services only 
we terminated these services from wendy s in december  after we transitioned to our own general ledger and us fixed asset repository system 
our consolidated financial statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of wendy s  principally from statements and records representing the tim hortons business segment 
our consolidated statements of operations also include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to us by wendy s  including general corporate expenses related to corporate functions such as executive oversight  risk management  information technology  accounting  legal  investor relations  human resources  tax  other services and employee benefits and incentives  including stock option compensation arrangements 
the allocations were primarily based on specific identification and the relative percentage of our revenues and headcount to the respective total wendy s costs 
these allocations were reflected in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we and wendy s considered these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided 
the allocations may not  however  reflect the expenses we would have incurred as a standalone company 
actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a standalone public company in fiscal would depend on a number of factors  including our chosen organizational structure  what functions were outsourced or performed by our employees and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology systems and infrastructure 
affiliated interest expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations reflected interest costs related to specific net borrowings by us  in the form of promissory notes  from wendy s 
no amount is included in affiliated interest expense  net for other amounts owed to wendy s by us which were not in the form of a promissory note and for which no interest rate was specified 
also  wendy s did not allocate a portion of its external debt interest cost to us 
as a result  interest expense recorded by us in fiscal did not reflect the expense we would have incurred as a standalone company 
we entered into new credit facilities which are guaranteed by us and certain of our other subsidiaries see liquidity and capital resources credit facilities above 
the functional currency of tim hortons inc has historically been the us dollar primarily because of its financial inter relatedness with wendy s 
tim hortons inc is essentially a holding company that holds investments and obligations that historically could have been carried on the books of wendy s and the functional currency of wendy s is the us dollar 
the completion of the ipo and the repayment of the note payable to wendy s in resulted in a change in the functional currency of tim hortons inc from the us dollar to the canadian dollar as the majority of the company s cash flows were  and continue to be in canadian dollars  in accordance with statement of accounting standards sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the functional currency of each of the company s subsidiaries and legal entities is the local currency in which each subsidiary operates  which is the canadian dollar  the us dollar or euros 
the majority of the company s operations  restaurants and cash flows are based in canada  and the company is primarily managed in canadian dollars 
as a result  the reporting currency is the canadian dollar 
the discussion below should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue at company operated restaurants is recognized upon tender of payment at the time of sale 
we operate warehouses in canada to distribute coffee and other dry goods and refrigerated and frozen products to an extensive franchise system 
revenues from these sales are recorded when the product is delivered to the franchisee 
royalties revenues are generally based upon a percentage of monthly sales and recognized in the month earned on a straight line basis 
we generally control  either through ownership or by leasing  a significant majority of the real estate on which the company s restaurants are located  and we lease the real estate to our franchisees 
rental income is recorded on the straight line basis 
most leases provide for fixed payments with 
table of contents contingent rent when sales exceed certain levels  while others provide for monthly rentals based on a percentage of sales 
fixed  or base  rental revenue is recorded on a straight line basis and contingent rental revenue is recognized when sales exceed certain levels 
franchise operations our restaurants are predominantly franchised 
we grant franchise licenses or operator agreements to independent operators who in turn pay franchise fees and other payments  which may include payments for equipment  royalties and  in most cases  rents for each restaurant opened 
franchise fees are collected at the time of sale or resale of the franchise 
franchise fees and equipment sales are generally recognized as income when each restaurant commences operations and payment is received from the franchisee  unless the franchisee is participating in our franchise incentive program see below 
royalties  based on a percent of monthly sales  are recognized as income on the accrual basis 
we have developed a franchise incentive program for some of our us franchisees  which provides financing for both the initial franchise fee and the purchase of certain restaurant equipment  furniture  trades fixtures  and interior signs 
the payment for those assets is deferred for a period of weeks from the date of opening  and the revenue is recognized after a sustained period of sales levels are achieved  or weeks  whichever is earlier 
the franchisee has the right to finance the initial franchise fee over a period of up to weeks from the opening of the restaurant 
the initial franchise fee revenues is recognized over a period of up to weeks 
during the initial week period  the royalty payments are typically reduced from to and rent is typically reduced from to of gross sales  respectively 
after the initial week period  the royalty rate and rental rate return to the standard rates of and  respectively 
franchisees may receive other financial assistance such as lower rents and royalties and certain other operating costs for restaurants in new and developing markets  and the amount of this assistance is an offset from rents and royalties revenues 
the timing of revenue recognition for sales  and franchise revenues rents and royalties and franchise fees does not involve significant estimates and assumptions 
we provide for estimated losses for revenues that are not likely to be collected 
although we generally enjoy a positive relationship with our franchisees  and collection rates are currently high  if average sales or the financial health of our franchisees were to deteriorate  we might have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
income taxes we have accounted for  and currently account for  income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
we record both canadian and us income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are expected to be realized  except for the amount of earnings related to our foreign operations where repatriation is not contemplated in the foreseeable future 
when considered necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflect the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim 
table of contents period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
as a subsidiary of wendy s  we were not a separate taxable entity for us federal and certain state income tax purposes prior to september  consequently  wendy s included our results of operations in its combined us federal and state income tax returns for the period until our separation from wendy s on september  for periods prior to september   our us tax provision was computed on a separate return basis 
effective january   we adopted fin  which provides guidance for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in accordance with fin  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of million  increasing our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  interest  and penalties and reducing the january  balance of retained earnings 
see note of the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes 
property and equipment depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method in amounts adequate to amortize costs over the following estimated useful lives depreciation periods buildings and leasehold improvements up to years or lease term restaurant and other equipment up to years capital leases lesser of useful life and lease term computer hardware and software up to years advertising fund property and equipment up to years other up to years construction in progress reclassified to above categories when put in use we estimate useful lives on buildings and equipment based on historical data and industry trends 
we monitor our capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
lease term as defined in sfas no 
accounting for leases  as amended 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are grouped into operating markets and tested for impairment whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
we test for impairment using the cash flows of the operating markets 
a significant deterioration in the cash flows of an operating market or other circumstances may trigger impairment testing 
if impairment is indicated  the fair value of the property and equipment is estimated using the discounted cash flows of the market or third party appraisals 
the interest rate used in preparing discounted cash flows is management s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital 
long lived assets were reviewed and tested for impairment  where applicable  as of year end and and it was concluded that there was no impairment 
in fiscal  the company concluded that the property and equipment related to two new england markets related to the new england acquisition  were impaired and recorded a million impairment charge 
goodwill goodwill resulted primarily from our acquisition of restaurants in new england in goodwill is not subject to amortization 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or in interim periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable by comparing the fair value of each reporting segment  as measured by discounted cash flows  to the carrying value  to determine if 
table of contents there is an indication that a potential impairment may exist 
we have determined our reporting segments to be canada and us  of which each reporting segment constitutes a business and has discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by management 
one of the most significant assumptions is the projection of future sales 
we review our assumptions each time goodwill is tested for impairment and make appropriate adjustments  if any  based on facts and circumstances available at that time 
we tested for goodwill impairment as of year end  and concluded that goodwill related to the us reporting segment was impaired 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the full value of the goodwill 
as at december  and december   the company had no goodwill 
gift certificates and cash cards in  we introduced a quick pay cash card program timcard 
customers can prepay for future purchases at participating tim hortons restaurants or over the internet by loading funds onto the timcard by cash or credit card when and as needed 
the timcards entitle the holder to use the value for purchasing product only and the amounts generally are nonrefundable and not redeemable for cash 
holders of the timcards are not entitled to any interest  dividends or returns on prepaid amounts 
there are no expiration dates on the cash cards  and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrease to customer balances 
cash collected from the loading of the timcard and interest earned thereon is recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet since these funds have been designated for use only by the cash card program to honour outstanding obligations  and changes in the restricted cash balances have been classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the restricted cash balance at december   represents the prepaid amounts not yet redeemed by customers 
it is our current intention that all interest on the restricted cash will be contributed to our advertising and promotion funds to help offset costs associated with this program 
while we will honour all cash cards presented for payment  we may  based on historical review after the program has been in place for some time  determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to  among other things  long periods of inactivity 
in these circumstances  to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws  the obligation for any such card balances may be transferred to our advertising and promotion funds 
no amounts were recognized in in addition to the timcard program  we continue to have gift certificates available in certain locations for a limited time 
the company will honour outstanding gift certificates 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or a timcard to purchase product at a company operated restaurant  we recognize the revenue from the sale of the product 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or timcard at a franchised restaurant  we recognize revenues  in the form of rents and royalties  arising from the sale of the goods and services 
we recognize income on unredeemed gift certificates gift certificate breakage when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificate value to relevant jurisdictions 
we determine gift certificate breakage based on historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined it is recognized over a seven year time period which is the estimated life of a gift certificate 
insignificant amounts have been recognized as a reduction in cost of sales in fiscal and no amounts were recognized in reserve contingencies for litigation and other matters in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 

table of contents variable interest entities we adopted fin r in we enter into flexible lease arrangements with certain operators that are not required to invest a significant amount of equity 
because the legal entity within which such an operator operates is considered to not be adequately capitalized  that entity is considered a variable interest entity vie 
based on our review of the financial statements received from these operators  our mathematical projections indicate we are the primary beneficiary of these vies and  accordingly  we have consolidated  and restaurants  or approximately  and of our total franchise restaurants  at year end   and  respectively 
the related minority interest is not considered material and is classified in other income expense  net on the consolidated statement of operations and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have no equity interest in any of our franchisees and have no off balance sheet exposures relative to any of our franchisees 
none of our assets serves as collateral for the consolidated restaurants  and creditors of these operators have no recourse to us 
the only exposure to us related to these vies relates to the collection of amounts due to us  which are collected weekly and which were recorded net of uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of fin r 
vies for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary have an inconsequential impact on our reported consolidated net income 
the impact of consolidating these vies to our consolidated balance sheets is also not significant 
there is a small percentage of restaurants considered to be vies in which we hold a significant variable interest  but for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this small percentage of franchise restaurants is also not material 
in connection with rsu awards to employees  the company established a trust that purchased and will retain shares to satisfy our contractual obligation to deliver stock to settle the awards for most canadian employees 
for accounting purposes  the cost of the purchase of shares held in trust has been accounted for as a reduction in outstanding shares of common stock and the trust has been consolidated in accordance with fin r since the company is the primary beneficiary 
stock based compensation we currently provide compensation to certain employees and directors in the form of restricted stock units and deferred stock units 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r share based payment 
our stock incentive plan is an omnibus plan  designed to allow for a broad range of equity based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units  stock options  stock appreciation rights  dividend equivalent rights  performance awards and share awards 
in addition  we may issue deferred stock units to our directors 
restricted stock units restricted stock units granted are measured at the fair value on grant day 
restricted stock units are generally expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses  consistent with the classification of the related employees compensation expense 
grants related to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately 
restricted stock units have dividend equivalent rights 
deferred stock units deferred stock units are granted to non employee members of the our board of directors and are expensed on the date of grant since they vest immediately 
deferred stock units are notional units which track the value of our common stock 
these units are settled in cash based on the value of our common stock on the toronto stock exchange tsx on the date of the director s separation of service from the company 
since the award is settled in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed 
deferred stock units have dividend equivalent rights  which are expensed as earned 

table of contents stock options the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions  including estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them the expected term  the expected volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
we have not issued any stock option awards in fiscal  and stock appreciation rights stock appreciation rights sars may be granted alone or in conjunction with a stock option 
a sar related to an option generally terminates upon the expiration  forfeiture or exercise of the related option  and is exercisable only to the extent that the related option is exercisable 
stock options with tandem sars enable the employee to exercise the stock option or receive a cash payment equal to the difference between the market price of the share on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option 
since the employee can request settlement in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed over the vesting period 
we have not issued any sars in fiscal  and segmented reporting we operate exclusively in the food service industry and have determined that our reportable segments are those that are based on methods of internal reporting and management structure and represent the manner in which our chief decision maker views and evaluates the various aspects of our business 
our reportable segments are the geographic locations of canada and the us recently issued accounting standards sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and inflation 
in accordance with our policies  we manage our exposure to various market based risks 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
our primary foreign exchange exposure to our cash flows results from purchases by canadian operations in us dollars and payments from canadian operations to us operations 
net cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were in excess of million for fiscal in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations when we translate our us operating results into canadian dollars for reporting purposes 
while these fluctuations are not significant to the consolidated operating results  the fluctuations in exchange rates do impact our us segment operating results  and can affect the comparability between quarters and year to year 
also  from time to time  we hold us dollars and other us dollar net positions in canadian dollar functional currency entities  to support our business needs and as a result of our cross border structure 
the holding of us dollar net positions in these entities can cause foreign exchange gains and losses which are included in other income expense  net  and can  therefore  affect our earnings 
we seek to manage significant cash flows and net income exposures related to exchange rate changes between these two currencies 
we may use derivative products to reduce the risk of a significant impact on our cash flows or net income 
forward currency contracts are entered into to reduce some of the risk related to purchases paid for by the canadian operations in us dollars  such as coffee  including certain intercompany purchases 
in addition  historically  we hedged wendy s investment in its canadian subsidiaries 
we do not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
we have a policy forbidding speculating in foreign currency 
by their nature  derivative financial instruments involve risk including the credit risk of non performance by counterparties  and our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
to minimize this risk  except in certain circumstances  we limit the notional amount per counterparty to a maximum of million 
forward currency contracts to sell canadian dollars and buy us million and us million were outstanding as of december  and december   respectively  primarily to hedge coffee purchases from third parties  including intercompany purchases 
the fair value unrealized loss on these forward contracts was million as of december  and as of december   there was an unrealized gain of million 
in  we entered into forward currency contracts that matured in march to sell million and buy us million to hedge the repayment of cross border intercompany notes being marked to market beginning in the third quarter of previously  the translation of these intercompany notes was recorded in comprehensive income  rather than in the consolidated statements of operations  in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts as of january  
table of contents was million  net of taxes of million 
on the maturity date of march   we received us million from the counterparties and disbursed to the counterparties million  resulting in a net cash flow of us million million to the counterparties representing the difference from the contract rate to spot rate on settlement 
these forward currency contracts remained highly effective cash flow hedges and qualified for hedge accounting treatment through their maturity 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the effective portion of these foreign currency contracts offset changes in the cross border intercompany notes  and a million gain was recognized as the ineffective portion of the foreign currency contracts in in  we entered into forward currency contracts to sell million canadian dollars and buy us million in order to hedge certain net investment positions in canadian subsidiaries 
under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities these forward currency contracts were designated as highly effective hedges 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts was million  net of taxes of million as of january  on the maturity dates in april   we received us million from the counterparties and disbursed to the counterparties million  resulting in a net cash flow of us million million to the counterparties representing the difference from the contract rate to spot rate on settlement 
these forward currency contracts remained highly effective cash flow hedges and qualified for hedge accounting treatment through their maturity 
the cumulative fair value realized loss on these contracts was million  net of taxes of million  on maturity in april changes in the fair value of these foreign currency net investment hedges are included in the translation adjustments line of other comprehensive income loss 
no amounts related to these net investment hedges impacted earnings 
at the current level of annual operating income generated from our us operations and current us dollar cash flow exposures  if the us currency rate changes by the entire year  the annual impact on our net income and annual cash flows would not be material 
commodity risk we purchase certain products such as coffee  wheat  oil and sugar in the normal course of business  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices 
therefore  we are exposed to some price volatility related to weather and more importantly  various other market conditions outside of our control 
however  we do employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally these techniques include setting fixed prices for periods of up to one year with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
we purchase a significant amount of green coffee and typically have purchase commitments fixing the price for a minimum of six months  and typically hedge against the risk of foreign exchange at the same time 
we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of these contract pricing techniques 
as we make purchases beyond our current commitments  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions 
while price volatility can occur  which would impact profit margins  we have some ability to increase selling prices to offset a rise in commodity prices  subject to consumer acceptance 
interest rate risk prior to february  we had insignificant external borrowings 
we are exposed to interest rate risk because our term debt of million bears a floating rate of interest  which is partially offset by cash that is primarily invested in floating rate instruments 
we seek to manage our net exposure to interest rate risk and our net borrowing costs by managing the mix of fixed and floating rate instruments based on capital markets and business conditions 
we will not enter into speculative swaps or other speculative financial contracts 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap for million of our million term loan facility to convert a portion of the variable rate debt from floating rate to fixed rate 
in the second quarter of  we entered into an additional million interest rate swap  resulting in a total of million in 
table of contents interest rate swaps outstanding in connection with our term loan 
the swaps convert a portion of the variable rate debt from floating rate to fixed rate 
the interest rate swaps essentially fix the interest rate on million of the million term loan at and mature on february  the weighted average interest rate on the term debt  including the swapped portion  was for fiscal 
the interest rate swaps are considered to be highly effective cash flow hedges according to criteria specified in sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fair value unrealized loss on these contracts as of december  was million  net of taxes of million 
if interest rates change by basis points  the impact on our annual net income which would be reduced due to our variable rate investments  would not be material 
inflation consolidated financial statements determined on an historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for our business inventories approximate current market prices  property holdings at fixed costs are substantial  there is some ability to adjust prices  and liabilities are repaid with dollars of reduced purchasing power 
however  if several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time  such as commodity price increases beyond our ability to control  and labour costs  we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand
