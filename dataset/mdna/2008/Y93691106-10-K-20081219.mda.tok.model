item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview basis of presentation the accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission sec 
for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes presented in this report on form k 
our fiscal year end is october  and our fiscal quarters end on january  april  and july unless otherwise stated  all dates refer to our fiscal years and fiscal periods 
amounts included in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars 
the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
certain amounts in the combined and consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and were reclassified to conform to the presentation used for fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million adjustment in interest income and other  related to foreign currency remeasurement gains 
these gains relate to a failure to remeasure certain foreign currency assets and liabilities  primarily value added tax receivables  arising in fiscal years  and the first two quarters of fiscal year approximately million relates to the unrecorded amounts arising from fiscal years and management has assessed the impact of this adjustment and does not believe the amounts are material  either individually or in the aggregate  to any of the prior years financial statements  and the impact of correcting these errors in the current year was not material to the full fiscal year financial statements 
certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states have been combined and or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations 
prior to june   we operated as part of agilent  and not as a stand alone company 
therefore  the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements  prior to june   were derived from the accounting records of agilent using the historical basis of assets and liabilities of verigy 
the expense and cost allocations  prior to june   have been determined on a basis we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided by agilent or the benefit received by us from agilent 
business summary prior to our initial public offering  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of agilent technologies  inc agilent 
we became an independent company on june   when we separated from agilent 
on june   we completed our initial public offering and became a separate stand alone publicly traded company focused on technology and innovation in semiconductor testing 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell advanced test systems and solutions for the semiconductor industry 
we offer a single platform for each of the two general categories of devices being tested our v series platform  designed to test system on a chip soc  system in a package sip and high speed memory devices and our v series platform  designed to test memory devices  including flash memory and multi chip packages 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we introduced our v series platform which is the successor to the v platform and was designed to test both flash memory and dynamic random access memory dram devices 
our test platforms are scalable across different frequency ranges  different pin counts and different numbers of devices under simultaneous test 
the test platforms flexibility also allows for a single test system to test a wide range 
table of contents of semiconductor device applications 
our single platform strategy allows us to maximize operational efficiencies such as relatively lower research and development costs  engineering headcount  support requirements and inventory risk 
this platform strategy also provides economic benefits to our customers by allowing them to move their complex  feature rich semiconductor devices to market quickly and to reduce their overall costs 
in addition to our test platforms  our product portfolio includes advanced analysis tools as well as consulting  service and support offerings such as start up assistance  application services and system calibration and repair 
as of october   we have installed more than  v series systems and nearly  v series systems worldwide 
we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers idms  test subcontractors  also referred to as subcontractors or osats outsourced sub assembly and test providers  which includes specialty assembly  package and test companies as well as wafer foundries  and companies that design  but contract with others for the manufacture of  integrated circuits ics known as fabless design companies 
overview of results our total net revenue for fiscal year  was million  down million  or  from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to lower revenue from sales of our memory test systems in fiscal year  partially offset by higher sales of our soc products and services 
the decline in our memory test revenues resulted from substantial declines in the capital spending patterns of our memory device manufacturer customers and of their subcontractor test partners to which we also sell systems 
the overall decline in the memory market capital spending reflects continued excess supply and price erosion for memory products  which has resulted in lower manufacturing output and excess test capacity 
these factors have caused our customers to delay test system orders and delay delivery of systems ordered 
in addition to the memory market downturn  uncertainties in the financial and credit markets  have caused our customers to postpone purchases which have negatively impacted our revenue particularly during our fourth quarter for our soc business 
notwithstanding the cyclical weakness in the memory test industry  our soc business showed considerable strength during fiscal year  with an increase of from fiscal year we experienced increased demand for our v platform for soc applications  in particular our port scale rf products  driven primarily by strong demand for our customers devices targeted at wireless  pc and consumer mixed signal device markets 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our soc business weakened  and we began to see an onset of a cyclical downturn 
in response to the overall deterioration in the global economy  customers are delaying purchases of capital equipment due to excess capacity as well as to ensure that they are able to sustain operations during this economic crisis 
our gross margin for fiscal year was down slightly compared to fiscal year we recorded net excess and obsolescence inventory charges of million for fiscal year  compared to million recorded for fiscal year  primarily related to our memory business as well as the impact of the introduction of our new v series system which was released during the first quarter of fiscal year this was offset by a stronger mix of soc systems  which generally have a higher gross margin than our memory systems 
our total operating expenses  including restructuring charges of million  were million in fiscal year  up million  or  from fiscal year this increase in operating expenses from fiscal year was primarily due to increased spending on research and development initiatives for memory products that were introduced in the first quarter of fiscal year and soc products planned for release later in fiscal year  higher share based compensation  operating expenses associated with the acquisition of inovys and increases in field selling and governance costs 

table of contents net income for fiscal year was million  a decrease of from the million achieved in fiscal year the decrease for fiscal year was primarily due to the overall decline in our memory business  other than temporary impairments of million related to write downs of our investments and net excess and obsolescence inventory charges of million in cost of sales 
in fiscal year  we generated operating cash flows of million and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of october  was million 
we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside of north america 
net revenue from customers located outside of north america represented  and of total net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net revenue in north america was lower by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the continuing outsourcing by our north american customers to contract manufacturers in asia 
net revenue in asia including japan was higher by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we expect this trend of increasing sales in asia to continue as semiconductor manufacturing activities continue to concentrate in that region 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
these cyclical periods have had  and will continue to have a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry 
historically  these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 
this was particularly relevant during the second and third quarters of fiscal year where we saw a significant decrease in revenue from our memory platform and experienced some order postponements 
due to our product diversification  however  we were able to partially offset the effect of this downturn in demand for flash memory systems with increased demand for our soc products fueled by the wireless  pc and consumer mixed signal device markets 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also began to see the soc business weaken due to the deteriorating global economy  which has negatively impacted the entire semiconductor industry 
the sharp swings in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 
furthermore  we sell to a variety of customers  including subcontractors 
because we sell to subcontractors  which during market troughs tend to decrease or postpone orders for new test systems and test services more quickly and dramatically than other customers  downturns may cause a quicker and more significant adverse effect on our business than on the broader semiconductor industry 
in addition  although a decline in orders for semiconductor capital equipment may accompany or precede the timing of a decline in the semiconductor market as a whole  recovery in semiconductor capital equipment spending may lag the recovery by the semiconductor industry 
although our visibility into when the semiconductor industry will recover remains poor  we will continue to invest in products in anticipation of a cyclical recovery in the market  and are working on initiatives to expand our customer base 
we remain committed to projects and programs which we believe will allow us to increase our market share and expand into higher growth segments 
in addition  in response to the weakened economic conditions  we have commenced actions targeted at reducing our quarterly operating cost structure to enable us to achieve break even results at revenue levels of million a quarter 
in order to achieve this objective  we announced in the first quarter of fiscal year  that we are implementing a restructuring program to streamline our organizations and further reduce our operating costs 
as part of this restructuring program  we plan to reduce our global workforce through a combination of attrition  voluntary and involuntary terminations and other workforce reduction programs consistent with local legal requirements 
we estimate that we will incur restructuring charges in the range of million to million for employee terminations costs  asset impairments  costs of consolidating facilities  and other related costs in fiscal year we anticipate quarterly costs savings of between million and million when this restructuring program is 
table of contents substantially completed in fiscal year  of which million to million relate to restructuring activities as described above and the remaining amounts relate to other cost saving initiatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and of actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies include revenue recognition  restructuring charges  inventory valuation  warranty  separation costs  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of marketable securities  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
net revenue is derived from the sale of products and services and is adjusted for estimated returns and allowances  which historically have been insignificant 
consistent with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor test equipment when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  for products  or when service has been performed 
we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments 
at the time we take an order  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
for sales or arrangements that include customer specified acceptance criteria  including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones or fulfillment of other future obligations  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
if the criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
to the extent that a contingent payment exceeds the fair value of the undelivered element  we defer the portion of revenue related to the contingent payment 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment 
software is embedded in many of our test equipment products  but the software component is considered to be incidental 
for revenue arrangements that include multiple elements  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf for products that include installation  if we have previously successfully installed similar equipment  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services includes extended warranty  customer support  consulting  training  and education services 
service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered to the customer 
for example  customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period  while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer 
in addition  all of the revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized 
we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
in the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element  we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
restructuring 
we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these 
table of contents estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
the three main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions  consolidating facilities and asset impairments 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to eliminate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment associated with excess facilities being eliminated  and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the property  plant and equipment 
the charges associated with consolidating facilities and asset impairment charges incurred by agilent prior to our separation were allocated to verigy to the extent the underlying benefits related to our business 
these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges sab  emerging issues task force  liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and lastly  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which was effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
in order to address the cyclical downturn and the negative impact on our results driven by the deteriorating global economy  we announced in the first quarter of fiscal year  that we are implementing a restructuring program to streamline our organizations and further reduce our operating costs 
as part of this restructuring program  we plan to reduce our global workforce through a combination of attrition  voluntary and involuntary terminations and other workforce reduction programs consistent with local legal requirements 
we estimate that we will incur restructuring charges in the range of million to million for employee terminations costs  asset impairments  costs of consolidating facilities  and other related costs in fiscal year we anticipate quarterly costs savings of between million and million when this restructuring program is substantially completed in fiscal year  of which million to million relates to restructuring activities as described above and the remaining amounts relate to other cost saving initiatives 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory  including demonstration inventory  on a quarterly basis based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
to the extent that we determine that we are holding excess or obsolete inventory  we write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
such write downs are reflected in cost of products and can be material in amount 
we recorded net inventory charges of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our inventory assessment involves difficult estimates of future events and  as a result  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of products and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
excess and obsolete inventory resulting from shifts in demand or changes in market conditions for raw materials and components can result in significant volatility in our costs of products 
in our inventory valuation analysis  we also include inventory that we could be obligated to purchase from our suppliers based on our production forecasts 
to the extent that our committed inventory purchases exceed our forecasted productions needs  we write down the value of those inventories by taking a charge to our cost of products and increasing our supplier liability 

table of contents warranty 
we generally provide a one year warranty on products commencing upon installation or delivery 
we accrue for warranty costs in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percent of gross product shipments 
estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time revenue is recognized and the liability is reported in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates 
for some products  we also offer extended warranties beyond one year 
costs associated with our extended warranty contracts beyond one year are expensed as incurred 
share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payment sfas no 
r  which was effective november  for verigy 
under this standard  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis for awards granted after november  over the vesting period of the award 
for awards issued prior to november   we recognize share based compensation expense based on fasb interpretation  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
we incurred million  million  and million in share based compensation expense during fiscal years   and  respectively 
also see note share based compensation for additional information 
retirement and post retirement plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of us gaap 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover and retiree mortality rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at each measurement date october for us plans and september for non us plans 
the discount rate for non us plans was determined based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally determined in a similar manner 
differences between the expected future cash flows of our plans and the maturities of the high quality corporate bonds are not expected to have a material impact on the selection of discount rates 
as discount rates decrease  we would expect our net plan costs to increase and as discount rates increase we would expect our net plan costs to decrease 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 became effective for us as of october  and requires recognition of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position reflecting the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans such as retiree health and life  with current year changes recognized in shareholders equity 
in fiscal year  in order to recognize the funded status of its 
table of contents pension and post retirement benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recorded additional liabilities by a cumulative amount of million  of which million net of tax of million was recorded as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants 
also see note retirement plans and post retirement benefits 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns 
declining rate of return assumptions generally result in increased pension expense while increasing rate of return assumptions generally result in lower pension expense 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on our pension plan assets would result in a million impact on pension expense for our fiscal year there are no plan assets related to our post retirement health care plans 
workforce related events such as restructurings or divestitures can result in curtailment and settlement gains or losses to the extent they have an impact on the average future working lifetime or total number of participants in our retirement and postretirement plans 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
based on our fiscal year impairment assessment  we concluded that we did not have any impairment as of october  our accounting for goodwill and purchased intangible assets complies with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time that impairment indicators arise 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to significant decrease in market price of an asset  significant adverse changes in the extent or use or physical condition of an asset  significant adverse change in legal or regulatory factors affecting an asset  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of expected costs to acquire or construct an asset  operating or cash flow losses or projections of losses that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  or a current expectation that more likely than not  an asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed using the straight line method over the economic lives of the respective assets  generally three to five years 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
valuation of marketable securities 
we account for our short term marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain 
table of contents investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

we classify our marketable securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each consolidated balance sheet date 
we amortize premiums and discounts against interest income over the life of the investment 
our marketable securities are classified as cash equivalents if the original maturity  from the date of purchase  is ninety days or less 
our marketable securities are classified as short term investments if the original maturity  from the date of purchase  is in excess of ninety days since we intend to convert them into cash as necessary to meet our liquidity requirements 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities and auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with interest rate reset periods of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each interest rate reset period  investors can buy  sell  or continue to hold the securities at par 
as of october   all of our auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
the funds associated with these auctions will not be accessible to us until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the underlying securities have matured or are called by the issuer 
given the ongoing disruptions in the credit markets and the fact that the liquidity for these types of securities remains uncertain  we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of october   as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
our auction rate securities primarily consist of investments that are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and other asset backed securities 
our marketable securities portfolio as of october  has a carrying value of million  of which approximately million consists of illiquid auction rate securities 
given the ongoing disruption in the market for auction rate securities  there is no longer an actively quoted market price for these securities 
accordingly  we utilized a model to estimate the fair value of these auction rate securities based on  among other items i the underlying structure of each security and the underlying collateral quality  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure  or repurchase at par for each period  and iv estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each security 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions 
we evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and insurance guarantor  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  at october   we have recorded an other than temporary impairment within the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  of million of which million was recorded during our fourth quarter related to a number of our auction rate securities 
we have also recorded a temporary impairment within accumulated other comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended october  of approximately million net of tax of million primarily for our auction rate securities that are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education 
investments in money market funds include investments in the reserve primary fund and the reserve international liquidity fund collectively referred to as the reserve funds 
the net asset value for the reserve funds fell below because the funds had holdings of commercial paper and other notes with a major investment bank which filed for bankruptcy on september  as a result of this event  the reserve funds wrote down their holdings in this bank to zero 
we estimated our loss on the reserve funds to be approximately million based on  among other things  the net asset value that was last published by the reserve funds before the funds suspended redemptions and our expected realization 
as a result of these events  these funds are no longer classified as cash and cash equivalents 
we have reclassified this investment as short term marketable securities as we believe 
table of contents that it will take up to one year to redeem this investment based on the maximum maturity date of the underlying securities as well as the proposed liquidation plan and distribution updates received for the funds 
this reclassification is reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a cash outflow from investing activities 
accounting for income taxes 
on november   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we first determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is that we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also required us to reclassify the majority of our uncertain tax positions from current to non current in fiscal year fin does not allow for retroactive treatment or presentation 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we are required to assess the realization of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
this assessment requires that our management make judgments about benefits that could be realized from future taxable income  as well as other positive and negative factors influencing the realization of deferred tax assets 
we had a valuation allowance of million as of october   compared to no such allowances as of october  the net increase of valuation allowance is attributable to deferred taxes related to capital losses which can only be realized through the generation of future capital gains 
undistributed earnings of our domestic us and foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested in the respective operations 
no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings  nor is it practicable to determine the amount of this liability 
our effective tax rate varies based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  restructuring and other one time charges  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
we are subject to audits and examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the internal revenue service 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

net revenue is derived from the sale of products and services and is adjusted for estimated returns and allowances  which historically have been insignificant 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of our test equipment products 
revenue from services includes extended warranty  customer support  consulting  training and education activities 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered to the customer 
net revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal year net product revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in fiscal year these decreases were due to lower revenue from sales of our memory test systems  partially offset by increases in soc and services revenue 
as noted in the overview above  our memory customers continue to delay memory tester purchases and have significantly cut their capital budgets due to excess supply and capacity 
despite the cyclical weakness in the memory test industry  our soc business showed strength during the first three quarters of fiscal year  reflecting a increase from fiscal year during fiscal year  we experienced increased demand for our v platform in soc testers  in particular our port scale rf products driven by wireless  pc and consumer mixed signal device markets 
however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the soc business also began to experience a cyclical downturn 
we are uncertain as to when the market will recover and expect revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year to be below the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal year net revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from the million achieved in fiscal year net product revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million achieved in fiscal year the decrease in product revenue was primarily due to lower sales volume of our soc sip test systems  partially offset by higher revenue from sales of our memory test systems  spurred by continued strong demand for hand held consumer products as well as the expansion of the markets that we serve into nand flash and flash final test 
we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside of north america 
net revenue from customers located outside of north america represented  and of total net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net revenue in north america was lower by in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  due to the continuing outsourcing by our north american customers to contract manufacturers in asia 
net revenue in asia was higher by in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year we expect this trend of increasing sales in asia to continue as semiconductor manufacturing activities continue to concentrate in that region 
service revenue for fiscal year accounted for million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in fiscal year unlike product revenue  service 
table of contents revenue tends not to experience significant cyclical fluctuations due to the fact that service contracts generally extend for one to two years and revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered 
service revenue in fiscal year accounted for million  an increase of million  or  compared to the million achieved in fiscal year the increase in service revenue is primarily attributable to our growing installed base

cost of products consists primarily of manufacturing materials  outsourced manufacturing costs  direct labor  manufacturing and administrative overhead  warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  partially offset  when applicable  by benefits from sales of previously written down inventory 
the decrease in cost of products of approximately million in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to the decrease in memory product shipments as well as decreases of separation costs and restructuring charges in fiscal year this was partially offset by a million increase in excess and obsolete inventory charges primarily driven by the significant drop in memory tester demand in general as well as the impact of the introduction of our new v series which was released in the first quarter of fiscal year our cost of products included million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expense in fiscal year  compared to million of such charges in fiscal year cost of products as a percent of net product revenue decreased by percentage points in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the shift in product mix toward higher gross margin soc products  as well as decreases of separation costs and restructuring charges in the current year period 
excluding the impact of the million incremental increase in inventory charges compared to fiscal year  cost of products as a percentage of revenue would have decreased by percentage points 
gross excess and obsolete inventory related charges in fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
we also sold previously written down inventory of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the sales of previously written down inventory improved our gross margins on product sales by approximately percentage points in fiscal year and percentage points in fiscal year the decrease in cost of products of approximately million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to a decrease in product shipments  cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs  million lower restructuring and separation costs and million lower excess and obsolete inventory related charges 
these decreases were partially offset by million higher freight and duty expenses and million higher warranty costs 
cost of products as a percent of net product revenue increased by percentage points in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of a decrease in product shipments and product mix  partially offset by less inventory write downs for discontinued products and cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs

cost of services year ended october  over change over change in millions cost of services as a percent of service revenue cost of services 
cost of services includes cost of field service and support personnel  spare parts consumed in service activities and administrative overhead allocations 
cost of services for fiscal year was million higher compared to fiscal year cost of services as a percent of service revenue increased by percentage points  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this margin deterioration is primarily due to the fact that we are putting more service capability in place for our upcoming product introductions and have experienced slight erosion in our average selling price of our extended service and support contracts 
in addition  we had higher material costs and experienced higher consumption  and had an unfavorable currency impact during the period 
our cost of services included million and million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expense fiscal years and  respectively 
cost of services increased by million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the million increase in services revenue and our increased costs needed to support a higher installed base  partially offset by cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs 
cost of services as a percent of service revenue decreased by percentage points  from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  reflecting better utilization of our service personnel as our installed base has increased as well as the benefit of the improved reliability and quality of our current product offering 
our cost of services also included approximately million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expense in fiscal year  compared to approximately million in fiscal year as a percent of service revenue  cost of services will vary depending on a variety of factors  including the effect of price erosion  the reliability and quality of our products and our need to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide

table of contents above  and share based compensation 
research and development costs have generally been expensed as incurred 
research and development expense increased by million in absolute dollars in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to higher expenses to support product development activities for memory products released in the first quarter of fiscal year and soc products planned for release during fiscal year research and development expense also included million and million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expense for fiscal years and  respectively 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase in research and development expense as a percent of revenue reflected the higher level of absolute spending combined with the lower revenue in the current year period 
research and development expense declined by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to lower expenses for project materials as well as cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs  partially offset by million higher share based compensation expenses 
research and development expenses included approximately million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expenses in fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year we believe that we need to maintain a significant level of research and development spending in order to remain competitive and  as a result  we expect our research and development expenses to only vary modestly in dollar amount from period to period  and to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue based on revenue levels

table of contents restructuring charges in fiscal year  we offered an early retirement plan to a number of eligible employees 
the total net charges incurred in fiscal year for this early retirement plan were approximately million  which was recorded within operating expenses 
for fiscal year  we recorded million of restructuring charges in our cost of sales and approximately million in our operating expenses  in each case relating to headcount reductions as we moved our operations to lower cost regions 
as of october   we had approximately million of accrued restructuring liability 
in order to address the cyclical downturn and the negative impact on our results driven by the deteriorating global economy  we announced in the first quarter of fiscal year that we are implementing a restructuring program to streamline our organizations and further reduce our operating costs 
as part of this restructuring program  we plan to reduce our global workforce through a combination of attrition  voluntary and involuntary terminations and other workforce reduction programs consistent with local legal requirements 
we estimate that we will incur restructuring charges in the range of million to million for employee terminations costs  asset impairments  costs of consolidating facilities  and other related costs in fiscal year we anticipate quarterly costs savings of between million and million when this restructuring program is substantially completed in fiscal year  of which million to million relates to restructuring activities as discussed above and the remaining amounts relate to other cost saving initiatives 
other income and expense the following table presents the components of interest income and other for fiscal years   and year ended october  in millions interest and other income net foreign currency gain other interest income and other interest income and other consists primarily of interest on cash  cash equivalents and investments  gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency as well as gains and losses on foreign exchange balance sheet hedge transactions 
these contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains and losses from remeasurement  which are generally for a period of days or less and settled by the end of the month 
in addition  approximately million of other income relates to foreign currency remeasurement gains 
these gains relate to a failure to remeasure certain foreign currency assets and liabilities  primarily value added tax receivables  arising in fiscal years and see note summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents the following table presents the components of impairment of investments for fiscal years   and year ended october  in millions impairment of cost based equity investments impairment of auction rate securities and money market funds impairment of investments during fiscal year  we incurred an million charge related to the write off of cost based equity investment that were determined to be impaired on an other than temporary basis 
additionally  we have recorded other than temporary impairments within the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  of million related to auction rate securities and million related to our money market funds 
see note marketable securities 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
through june   verigy s income tax provision reflected amounts based on agilent s consolidated tax profile  thus our income tax provision for the first seven months of fiscal year consisted of allocated expense from agilent 
since our separation from agilent on june   our tax provision is fundamentally based on our new business model and tax status in the countries where we do business 
as of october  and  we had million and million of net deferred tax assets  respectively  due to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the net assets  most of which were acquired upon our separation from agilent 
upon our separation from agilent  we did not retain any pre separation deferred tax assets or liabilities which had resulted from historical temporary differences  net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
our effective tax rate varies based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  restructuring and other one time charges  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
we are subject to audits and examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the internal revenue service 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
on november   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we first determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is that we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also required us to reclassify the majority of our uncertain tax positions from current to non current in fiscal year fin does not allow for retroactive treatment or presentation 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations 
the impact of our adoption of fin is more fully discussed in note provision for income taxes 
over the next twelve months  we do not expect to have a material change in our unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of october  this decrease in cash was primarily due to the repurchase of ordinary shares and investments in other private companies made during fiscal year  including the acquisition of inovys 
this was offset by cash generated from our operations and net cash proceeds from our available for sale securities 
we have also reclassified approximately million of money market fund investments from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments as we believe that they will be redeemed within one year 
prior to june   agilent used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations 
as such  transactions relating to our business prior to june  were accounted for through the agilent net invested equity account for our business 
accordingly  none of the cash  cash equivalents or debt at the agilent corporate level had been assigned to our business in the historical combined and consolidated financial statements prior to june  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operating activities  compared to million in fiscal year the million cash generation during fiscal year was a result of million of net income  a million reduction in receivables as a result of customer payments  and a change in net assets of million 
also during fiscal year  we had non cash charges of million from depreciation and amortization expense  million from inventory write downs  million of net share based compensation costs  a million impairment loss on marketable securities and cost based equity investments  and a million loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment 
these impacts were partially offset by an increase of million in inventory primarily due the purchase of raw materials relating to our service and support business and the introduction of our new v which was released in the first quarter of fiscal year  and decreases of million in income tax and other taxes payable  million in employee compensation and benefits  million in payables  and million in deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the million cash generated during fiscal year was primarily due to million of net income  a million decrease in our receivables  a million increase in employee compensation and benefits  and a million increase in deferred revenue 
these were partially offset by a decrease of million in payables to agilent  a decrease in income taxes and other taxes payable of million and a decrease in other current and long term assets and liabilities of approximately million 
also  in fiscal year  we had non cash charges of million from depreciation and amortization  million of inventory write downs  and million of net share based compensation costs 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million  compared to million used in fiscal year the net cash used was primarily related to the cash paid for the acquisition of inovys and other investments of million  net of cash acquired  as well as the investments made in our property  plant and equipment of million 
this was partially offset by the net proceeds from the purchase  sale and maturities of available for sale marketable securities of million 
in addition  as further discussed below  we reclassified approximately million of cash and cash equivalents to short term marketable securities 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities and auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with interest rate reset periods of generally less than ninety days but with contractual 
table of contents maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each interest rate reset period  investors can buy  sell  or continue to hold the securities at par 
as of october   all of our auction rate securities experienced failed auctions 
the funds associated with these auctions will not be accessible to us until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the underlying securities have matured or are called by the issuer 
given the ongoing disruptions in the credit markets and the fact that the liquidity for these types of securities remains uncertain  we have classified all of our auction rate securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of october   as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next months is uncertain 
our auction rate securities primarily consist of investments that are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education and other asset backed securities 
our marketable securities portfolio as of october  has a carrying value of million  of which approximately million consists of illiquid auction rate securities 
given the ongoing disruption in the market for auction rate securities  there is no longer an actively quoted market price for these securities 
accordingly  we utilized a model to estimate the fair value of these auction rate securities based on  among other items i the underlying structure of each security and the underlying collateral quality  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii consideration of the probabilities of default  auction failure  or repurchase at par for each period  and iv estimates of the recovery rates in the event of default for each security 
these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions 
we evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and insurance guarantor  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  at october   we have recorded an other than temporary impairment within the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  of million of which million was recorded during our fourth quarter related to a number of our auction rate securities 
we have also recorded a temporary impairment within accumulated other comprehensive loss for the fiscal year ended october  of approximately million net of tax of million primarily for our auction rate securities that are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the us department of education 
investments in money market funds include investments in the reserve primary fund and the reserve international liquidity fund collectively referred to as the reserve funds 
the net asset value for the reserve funds fell below because the funds had holdings of commercial paper and other notes with a major investment bank which filed for bankruptcy on september  as a result of this event  the reserve funds wrote down their holdings in this bank to zero 
we estimated our loss on the reserve funds to be approximately million based on  among other things  the net asset value that was last published by the reserve funds before the funds suspended redemptions and our expected realization 
as a result of these events  these funds are no longer classified as cash and cash equivalents 
we have reclassified this investment as short term marketable securities as we believe that it will take up to one year to redeem this investment based on the maximum maturity date of the underlying securities as well as the proposed liquidation plan and distribution updates received for the funds 
this reclassification is reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a cash outflow from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the million of net investment was primarily related to million invested in available for sale securities and million of cash payments for site set ups and leasehold improvements  partially offset by million of proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale marketable securities 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities and auction rate securities  and reported at fair value with the related unrealized 
table of contents gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  certain auction rate securities failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  we recorded a temporary impairment within other comprehensive loss of approximately million net of tax of million at october  related to these auction rate securities 
our marketable securities portfolio as of october  was million 
the portfolio includes million at cost invested in auction rate securities of which  million at cost are currently associated with failed auctions  all of which have been in a loss position for less than months 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  we classified our auction rate securities with failed auctions as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was million  compared to million provided in fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  our shareholders approved the share repurchase program  which provides our directors authority to acquire up to percent  or approximately million shares  of our outstanding ordinary shares 
the million net cash used in fiscal year was comprised of approximately million of repurchase and retirement of ordinary shares  offset by million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation  million from the exercise of employee stock options  and approximately million from contributions by participants to our employee shares purchase plan  pursuant to which  shares and  shares were issued in the first and third quarter of fiscal year  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the million of net cash proceeds was comprised of approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options  million from contributions by participants in our employee shares purchase plan  and approximately million for excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
other our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of approximately million  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs at least through the next twelve months 
we may require or choose to obtain debt or equity financing in the future 
we cannot assure you that additional financing  if needed  will be available on favorable terms or at all 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at october  in millions total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments long term liabilities total the contractual obligation table excludes our fin liabilities because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
as of october   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  of which million is recorded as long term liabilities  and an additional million have been netted against related deferred tax assets 
operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
following our separation  we have entered into long term lease arrangements for our corporate headquarters in singapore  our principal us facility in cupertino  california  and our boeblingen  germany facility  the site of our v series platform development 
we have also entered into long term lease arrangements for our asic development office in colorado  as well as other sales and support facilities around the world 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and historically we have used several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  or adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately of our purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill the purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts 
such liabilities were million as of october   and million as of october  these amounts are included in other current liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance sheets at october  and october  other purchase commitments 
these commitments relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers  which include third party consultants for legal  finance  engineering and other administrative services 
with the exception of our it service providers  our purchase commitments from professional service providers are typically cancelable with a notice of days or less without significant penalties 
the agreement with our primary it service provider requires a notification period of days and includes a termination charge of up to approximately million in order to cancel our long term contract 
long term liabilities 
long term liabilities relate primarily to million of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement obligations  and million of extended warranty and deferred revenue obligations 
upon our separation from agilent  the defined benefit plans for our employees located in germany  korea  taiwan  france and italy were transferred to us 
with the exception of italy and france  which involve relatively insignificant amounts  agilent completed the funding of these transferred plans  based on of the accumulated benefit obligation level as of the separation date 

table of contents we made approximately million of contributions to the retirement plans for both periods presented 
we expect expenses of approximately of million in fiscal year for the retirement plans  and we plan on making cash contributions of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in a number of major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in japanese yen 
services and support sales are denominated primarily in local currency after the initial product sale 
a significant amount of expenses are denominated in euro for certain expenses such as employee payroll and benefits as well as other expenses that are paid in local currency 
in addition  other expenses related to our non us and non european offices are denominated in the countries local currency 
as such  we enter into cash flow and balance sheet hedges to mitigate our foreign currency risk 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on euro denominated cash flows where the us dollar is the functional currency and japanese yen denominated cash flows and forecasted japanese yen denominated revenue 
we currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation 
we have implemented a cash flow hedging strategy that is intended to mitigate our currency exposures by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that have maturities in excess of one month 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues  costs and eventual cash flows 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the foreign exchange gain loss being reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity and later reclassified into the statement of operations as part of income from operations when the hedged transaction affects earnings 
if the underlying foreign currency requirement being hedged fails to occur  or if a portion of any derivative is deemed to be ineffective  we will recognize the gain loss on the associated financial instrument in operating income in the statement of operations 
as of october   the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges is approximately million 
this amount is included within current liabilities and the related loss of million net of tax of million is included within unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
these contracts are generally for a period of days or less and settled by the end of the month 
the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of interest income and other and offsets the change in fair value of the remeasured assets and liabilities 
see note other income and expense 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market 
table of contents movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
investment and interest rate risk we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for investments in debt and equity securities 
all of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bond and government securities  money market funds which we believe will be redeemed within one year and auction rate securities 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
should interest rates fluctuate by percent  the value of our marketable securities would not have a significant impact as of october   and our interest income would have changed by approximately million for fiscal year auction rate securities are securities that are structured with interest rate reset periods of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years
