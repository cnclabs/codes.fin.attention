item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of this annual report on form k 
overview of performance and company and industry trends 
in  the company continued to execute its strategy of developing and managing high quality real estate 
the company also improved the performance and enhanced the value of its operating assets through strong leasing activities at several of its office and retail properties 
in addition  the company strengthened its balance sheet by recasting its credit facility and closing three mortgage loans in addition to placing an asset under development into a joint venture with an institutional investor 
management believes that these changes position the company to be opportunistic in the coming period of uncertain real estate markets 
the company commenced construction of three new office multi family development projects in these projects included terminus  a  square foot office building  terminus place  a unit condominium tower  and glenmore garden villas  a unit townhome project in charlotte 
the office multi family division continued the development of its palisades west project in austin which is scheduled for a third quarter completion 
in  the office multi family division completed the construction of terminus in atlanta and biscayne in miami 
upon opening  terminus was leased and at year end was leased 
at year end  condominium units over within the biscayne condominium project closed 
as a result of the pace of unit closings  the venture that owns biscayne repaid its construction loan in early january while management expects that approximately to of the original contracts will not close  it is encouraged by the number of closings to date in light of the overall weakness in the condominium market in the miami area 
the company commenced construction of two retail projects in the avenue forsyth  the company s largest avenue project in metropolitan atlanta  and tiffany springs marketcenter  a  square foot power center in kansas city 
the retail division also opened the avenue murfreesboro  the largest avenue project to date 
the industrial division closed on the purchase of acres of land in lancaster  texas  a dallas suburb  for future development 
the division was also selected  along with two other partners  as the master developer for the redevelopment of fort gillem  a  acre military base in suburban atlanta 
in  the industrial division continued the site preparation and leasing activities on its three existing projects king mill distribution park  jefferson mill business park and lakeside ranch business park 
during  the company also made progress in leasing its existing assets 
the most notable progress was the execution of a lease with the georgia department of transportation at one georgia center 
this lease took this building from leased to leased 
in addition  leasing at the company s peachtree building is proceeding better than management s initial expectations 
at the beginning of the year  this building was leased and was leased by year end although wachovia has a lease for approximately  square feet that will expire at the end of  which will reduce the percentage leased at that time 
subsequent to year end  the company executed a  square foot lease with deloitte touche at peachtree that brought the building to leased 
the company also has made progress with the lease up of its two most recently completed retail projects 
san jose marketcenter improved from leased at the beginning of the year to leased at year end  and the avenue webb gin improved from leased at the beginning of the year to leased at year end 
the company did not sell as many assets in as it did in prior years  and it did not pay a special dividend to stockholders as a result 
in  the company generated gross proceeds of million from the sale of one office building and five ground leased outparcels compared to over million in such proceeds in the company took steps in to improve its capital structure by recasting its credit facility and entering into new or renewed fixed rate mortgage loans 
the company s credit facility was modified to increase the size by million to million  extend the maturity date  decrease the interest rate by reducing the spread over libor  and increase the borrowing base and borrowing capacity 
as a part of this facility  the company entered into 
table of contents a five year  million term loan whose underlying libor rate is effectively fixed through an interest rate swap 
in addition  the company closed three fixed rate mortgage loans with maturity dates ranging from three to years 
interest rates on these loans range from to  which management believes is favorable given the state of the markets during the time when these loans were being negotiated and closed 
the aggregate proceeds from these loans were approximately million which were used initially to reduce indebtedness under the credit facility but ultimately provides capacity to fund existing developments and to position the company to act on new development opportunities or other strategic purposes 
the company also entered into a joint venture with prudential to develop terminus upon formation  the company contributed land and predevelopment assets  prudential contributed cash  and the venture closed a construction loan to provide additional funding for the project 
while management is optimistic about the success of this project given the success of terminus  it believes this venture appropriately mitigates the risk of overexposure to class a office product in the buckhead district of the atlanta submarket 
this venture is expected to be a venture with respect to funding  however  the company is entitled to receive more than of the economics if the project s returns meet or exceed certain performance metrics 
the construction loan is expected to fund of the anticipated costs of terminus  is priced at libor plus and matures in the combination of the venture and the construction loan will substantially reduce the future funding requirements of the company 
the company s land business continued to decline in lot sales steadily fell throughout the year reflecting the overall weakness in the residential markets 
within the company s markets  new home sales have slowed and builders hold lot inventories that will more than meet the anticipated demand for the foreseeable future 
until these inventories fall  management does not expect much improvement in the volume of its residential lot sales 
the company has slowed the development of additional lots and will work to continue to reduce its lot inventory until the markets begin to recover 
while management is optimistic about the long term profitability of its land business  it is unable to determine when market conditions will turn more favorable for the company 
likewise  the condominium market continues to be unfavorable overall and within the company s core markets 
while closings at its biscayne project are occurring in an unfavorable miami condominium environment  management expects that the units that do not close will need to be held for a period of time and re sold when market conditions improve 
management  however  believes that there are niches within its markets  particularly in atlanta and charlotte  where supply and demand are in better balance 
management believes that the condominium project it has undertaken in atlanta is of a particular price and quality that are not currently in over supply 
however  given the state of the markets overall  there is no guarantee that this project will be successful 
the company intends to continue to pursue condominium development projects but intends to be cautious in these pursuits 
as a result  management expects the number of opportunities that meet its underwriting standards to be limited in in  management believes that opportunities for traditional office and retail development projects will be lower than in previous years  and the actual number of these development starts for the company will be down 
with respect to retail projects  the company generally moves forward with a development project when management is comfortable with the level of commitment received from key retailers 
as a result of various factors  including those impacting the residential market as described above  there are a significant number of retailers experiencing lower than expected sales levels  holiday sales in particular  and management expects this trend to continue until the overall market improves 
these trends are expected to impact the willingness of retailers to commit to new projects and their willingness to maintain current stores 
the inability of retailers to commit to new or existing projects could adversely impact the growth of the company s development pipeline and or the leasing prospects at current centers 
however  management expects other  more non traditional  opportunities for creating stockholder value will emerge as various macroeconomic factors  such as changes in the credit markets  make it difficult for less capitalized developers or owners to commence or sustain projects 
if these opportunities present themselves  management believes the company is well positioned to act upon them as a result of its relatively conservative capital structure and the capacity generated by the recent debt restructurings and additions discussed above 

table of contents for the foreseeable future  the company will continue to pursue development projects that meet its underwriting criteria and execute the strategy that has proven successful over its year history through multiple real estate cycles 
critical accounting policies 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and the notes to consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties  developing multi family residential units  and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to its long lived assets  including cost capitalization  acquisition of operating property  depreciation and amortization  and impairment of long lived assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and goodwill  revenue recognition  including residential lot sales  land tract sales  multi family residential unit sales and valuation of receivables  and accounting for investments in non wholly owned entities 
long lived assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate development 
the company expenses predevelopment expenses incurred on a potential project until it becomes probable more likely than not at the point the decision is made that the project will go forward 
after the company determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
if the probability of a project comes into question  a reserve may be placed on the assets 
if the decision is made to abandon development of a project that had earlier been deemed probable  all previously capitalized costs are expensed or charged against the reserve  if one was established 
therefore  a change in the probability of a project could result in the expensing of significant costs incurred for predevelopment activity 
the company had approximately million of capitalized predevelopment assets as of december  at the time the company determines that a development project is probable  the company estimates the time and cost of construction to complete the project 
a change in the estimated time and cost of construction could adversely impact the return on the project and the amount of value created from the development of the project 
additionally  determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
in accordance with sfas nos 
and  the company capitalizes direct and related indirect project costs associated with development projects during the construction period 
once a project is deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  subsequent carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
the company considers projects and or project phases substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the phase reached occupancy of or one year from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
acquisition of operating property 
in addition to developing properties for investment purposes  the company also occasionally acquires completed and operating properties 
the company allocates the purchase price of operating properties acquired to land  building  tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based upon relative fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  which requires considerable judgment 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of assumptions including hypothetical expected lease up periods  known and anticipated trends  and local market and economic conditions  including probability of lease renewal and estimated lease terms 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired operating property  including land  building and tenant improvements  considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
intangible assets can consist of above or below market tenant and ground leases  customer relationships and the value of in place leases 
tangible and 
table of contents intangible assets are amortized over their respective expected lives 
if management uses incorrect assumptions  thereby incorrectly allocating acquisition cost to the different components or assigns an incorrect amortization period to any asset  then net income may not be reflected properly 
depreciation and amortization 
real estate assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses its judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating development project costs 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in the carrying values of its held for use assets and records impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the evaluation of real estate assets involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
for example  future cash flows from properties are estimated using expected market rental rates  anticipated leasing results and potential sales results 
a change in assumptions concerning future economic events could result in an adverse change in the value of a property and cause an impairment to be recorded 
the company has analyzed all real estate assets that had indicators of impairment and has determined that the carrying value of all real estate assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets does not exceed undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets 
based on this analysis  no impairment losses were required to be recorded 
unconsolidated joint ventures follow the same impairment assessment of their properties as the company 
additionally  the company evaluates its investments in joint ventures  if indicators warrant the need for a review  and determines whether the impairment is other than temporary 
if management determines that the impairment is other than temporary  a discounted cash flow calculation is prepared and an adjustment recorded  if needed 
the company also evaluates its goodwill annually  which requires certain estimates and judgments  specifically related to the fair value of its reporting units 
based on the company s analysis  no significant impairment losses were recorded 
revenue recognition residential lot and land tract sales 
in its determination of the gross profit recognized on its residential lot and land tract sales  the company utilizes several estimates 
gross profit percentages are calculated based on the estimated lot sales prices and the estimated costs of the development or on the estimated total land tract sales and any estimated development or improvement costs 
the company must estimate the prices of the lots or land tracts to be sold  the costs to complete the development of the residential community or the land improvements and the time period over which the lots or land tracts will ultimately be sold 
if the company s estimated lot or land tract sales  timing or costs of development  or the assumptions underlying all  were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the overall profit recognized on these sales 
multi family residential unit sales 
if a certain threshold of non refundable deposits are obtained upon sale of a multi family residential unit and other factors are met  the company recognizes profits of multi family residential units on the percentage of completion method 
therefore  revenues on these units are recognized before the contract actually closes and before the entire sales price is obtained 
if the company determines that the remaining sales price of certain units may not be collectible  percentage of completion accounting may cease for those units 
the company assesses the collectibility of the full sales price at closing by reviewing the overall market conditions in the specific area of each project as well as the market for re sales of individual units at each project 
these factors  combined with the amount of the non refundable deposits and an assessment of the buyer s financial condition  assist the company in assessing the likelihood that the buyer will ultimately pay the contractual purchase price at closing 
if the level of continuing involvement on the buyer s side is uncertain  the company estimates the percentage of units under contract that it anticipates ultimately may not close 
additionally  cost of sales are recognized using the estimated profit percentage during construction of the project  which percentage could change significantly during the course of development 
the percentage of completion method involves significant estimates  particularly in determining the profit percentage to be realized on the overall project  the percentage 
table of contents that construction is complete at reporting periods during the project  and judgments as to the collectibility of unit purchase prices upon completion 
if the company inaccurately estimates costs to construct the project  the estimated profit percentage is ultimately incorrect or if its judgments regarding collectibility are incorrect  actual final results could differ from previously estimated results 
in november  the fasb ratified the consensus in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of the assessment of a buyer s continuing investment under fasb statement no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  for sales of condominiums  which provides guidance for determining the adequacy of a buyer s continuing investment and the appropriate profit recognition in the sale of individual units in a condominium project 
this issue requires that companies evaluate the adequacy of a buyer s continuing investment in recognizing condominium revenues on the percentage of completion method by applying paragraph of sfas no 
to the level and timing of deposits received on contracts for condominium sales 
the company will adopt eitf on january  the company is currently analyzing in detail the effects of adoption of this standard on future results of operations 
management believes that some of its existing condominium contracts would not meet the requirements for percentage of completion accounting at the same time as under the existing standards and could  under the new standard  be accounted for on the completed contract method 
this would result in later recognition of revenues than the company has historically presented 
valuation of receivables 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against its receivables 
this review process requires the company to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
accounting for non wholly owned entities the company holds ownership interests in a number of ventures with varying structures 
the company evaluates all of its partnership interests and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r 
if the venture is a vie and if the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
for entities that are not determined to be vies  the company evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
entities under the company s control are consolidated and entities over which the company can exert significant influence  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the company recognizes minority interest on its consolidated balance sheets for non wholly owned entities which the company consolidates 
the minority partner s share of current operations is reflected in minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of income 
contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for income from unconsolidated joint ventures and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the company s balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets on the joint venture s balance sheet is amortized as an adjustment to income from unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
if the company s judgment as to the existence of a vie  the primary beneficiary of the vie  and the extent of influence and control over a non vie is incorrect  the presentation of the balance sheet and results of operations could be incorrect 
discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
in addition to eitf discussed in the multi family residential unit sales section  in september the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value 
table of contents measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated operating results or financial condition 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which amended sfas no 
 effective for business combinations that close after january  also in december and effective for the company on january   the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the company has not analyzed the effect of these statements on its financial position or results of operations 
results of operations for the three years ended december  general 
historically  the company s financial results have been significantly affected by sale transactions and the fees generated by  and start up operations of  major real estate developments 
these types of transactions and developments do not necessarily recur 
accordingly  the company s historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  in periods prior to  the company recorded reimbursements of salary and benefits of on site employees pursuant to management agreements with third parties and joint ventures as reductions of general and administrative expenses 
in  the company began recording these reimbursements in fee income on the consolidated statements of income and reclassified prior period amounts to conform to the presentation 
as a result  fee income and general and administrative expenses increased by million in when compared to the form k as filed

fee income 
fee income did not change significantly between  and fee income is comprised of management fees  development fees and leasing fees  which the company performs for joint ventures in which it has an ownership interest and third party property owners 
these amounts vary by years  due to the number of contracts with ventures and third party owners and the development and leasing needs at the underlying properties 
amounts could vary in future years based on volume and composition of activities at the underlying properties 
residential lot and outparcel sales and cost of sales 
residential lot and outparcel sales decreased million between and and decreased million between and residential lot and outparcel cost of sales decreased million between and and decreased million between and residential lot sales and cost of sales the company s residential lot business consists of projects that are consolidated  for which income is recorded in the residential lot and outparcel sales and cost of sales line items  and projects that are owned through joint ventures in which the company is a partner with temco and cl realty  for which income is recorded in income from unconsolidated joint ventures 
lot sales were as follows consolidated projects temco cl realty total as noted above  demand for residential lots is down significantly as a result of general market conditions and as a result of limited demand in the company s and its ventures principal markets in texas  florida and metropolitan atlanta 
builders  the company s and its ventures primary customers for residential lots  have a general oversupply of inventory in the company s markets and are working to reduce inventory levels before they consider buying additional lots 
in addition  the changes in credit availability for home buyers and homebuilders have made it more difficult obtain financing for purchases 
management is closely monitoring market developments but is currently unable to predict when markets will improve 
management expects these market conditions to continue to negatively impact residential lot sales and have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations until such time as the residential lot markets improve 
therefore  consistent with current market trends  the company anticipates residential lot sales for  like those in  will be lower than those the company experienced in and  both at consolidated projects and at temco and cl realty 
the company cannot currently quantify the effect of the current slowdown on its results of operations for and forward 
the change in residential lot cost of sales was also partially due to the number of lots sold during the periods and partially to fluctuations in gross profit percentages used to calculate the cost of sales for residential lot sales in certain of the residential developments

provision for income taxes from operations 
an income tax provision is recorded for the company s taxable subsidiary  crec  and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the income tax provision decreased million between and to a benefit of million  and the provision decreased million between and the decrease is due mainly to decreases in taxable income at crec caused by a reduction of lot and tract sales  
table of contents both at company owned projects and joint ventures  and a reduction in the company s share of income from trg columbus development venture  ltd 
trg  the venture that owns biscayne 
the decrease was a result of a decrease in taxable income at crec caused by a reduction in lot and tract sales and to an adjustment to current and deferred income tax liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income from unconsolidated joint ventures 
all amounts reflect the company s share of joint venture income 
income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million between and and increased million between and a detailed discussion by venture follows income from csc decreased approximately million in compared to and increased approximately million in compared to due to the sale of bank of america plaza  the single asset of this venture  in september the company recognized a gain of approximately million from this sale in the third quarter of income from trg decreased approximately million between and trg recognizes income on its condominium units under contract for sale using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in october  trg began closing units under contract and  as of december   of the units at the biscayne project have closed 
however  given the current market for condominium units in the miami area and the overall current condition of the credit markets for financing the purchase of condominiums  some of the contracts are in default and management believes that some of the units in default and potentially other units may not ultimately close

sfas no

funds from operations 
the table below shows funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo and the related reconciliation to net income available to common stockholders for the company 
the company calculated ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
in  the company included million in income from a real estate venture related to the sale of real estate in its nareit defined calculation of ffo 
the company included this amount in ffo because  based on the nature of the investment  the company believes this income should not be considered gain on the sale of depreciable property 
the company presented the nareit defined calculation and also presented an adjusted nareit defined calculation of ffo to add back the losses on extinguishment of debt recognized in in connection with the venture formation in june with prudential and the sale of bank of america plaza in september the company presented this additional measure of ffo because the losses on extinguishment of debt that the company recognized related to a sale or an exchange of depreciable real estate  and all other amounts related to a sale or an exchange of depreciable real estate are excluded from ffo 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates the operating performance of its reportable segments and of its divisions based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and key employees

cash flows from operating activities also increased as a result of net cash provided by recently developed income producing properties net of a reduction in such revenue as a result of the contribution of certain retail properties to cpv iv and the sale of other properties
