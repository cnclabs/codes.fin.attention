item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict and in recent years have become more volatile and shorter in duration 
becau se the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential periods of growth or declines in orders and net revenues during each cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  in recent years we have begun to market our thermostream temperature management systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace  medical and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
while the majority of our orders and net revenues are derived from the ate market  our operating results do not always follow the overall trend in the ate market in any given period 
we now believe that these anomalies may be driven by a variety of emerging changes within the ate market  including  for example  changing product requirements  longer time periods between new product offerings by oems and changes in customer buying patterns 
in particular  demand for our manipulator  docking hardware and tester interface products  which are sold exclusively within the ate industry  and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by recent shifts in the competitive landscape  including i customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs and ordering in smaller quantities which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing u nit costs  ii the increasing practice of oem manufacturers to specify other suppliers as primary vendors  with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations  iii the increased role of third party test and assembly houses in the ate market and their requirement of products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost  and iv customer supply line management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors 
these recently emerging shifts in market practices have had  and may continue to have  varying levels of impact on intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our operating results  but it is difficult to quantify the impact of these practices from period to period 
management has taken  and will continue to take  such actions it deems appropriate to adjust our strategies  products and operations to counter such shifts in market practices as they become evident 
net revenues and orders the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location of the selling entity 
years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers manipulator and docking hardware temperature management tester interface intersegment sales intersegment sales manipulator and docking hardware temperature management tester interface net revenues from unaffiliated customers net of intersegment sales manipulator and docking hardware temperature management tester interface net revenues from unaffiliated customers us europe asia pacific our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million or as compared to during  we experienced higher levels of demand than were present in  with our peak demand occurring during the second quarter of throughout  we experienced reduced levels of demand  particularly in our manipulator and docking hardware product segment  where our net revenues net of intersegment sales declined million or 
in our tester interface product segment  net revenues also declined  or in as compared to the net revenues of our temperature management product segment remained relatively unchanged in as compared to during  our net revenues from customers in the us and asia decreased and  respectively  while our net revenues from customers in europe increased over the comparable period in adjusted to eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the decrease in net revenues from customers in asia would have been and the increase from customers in europe would have been 
the higher percentage decrease for our customers in asia primarily reflects the decline in sales of third party products by our japanese subsidiary 
the increase for our european customers primarily reflects higher net revenues for our operation in northern germany which sells our temperature management products to customers in europe 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total orders for the year ended december  decreased to million on a consolidated basis as compared to million for for our manipulator and docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface product segments  total orders for were million  million and million  respectively compared to million  million and million  respectively  for we believe that the decline in our net revenues and orders in reflects many of the factors discussed in the overview 
both our manipulator and docking hardware and tester interface product segments continue to be significantly affected by the aforementioned shifts in the competitive landscape within the ate market  while our temperature management product segment has been less impacted by these changes in demand as a result of our ability to successfully market our thermostream products outside the semiconductor industry 
in  of our temperature management product segment s net revenues were attributable to customers in markets outside of semiconductor test 
the reduction in net revenues in our manipulator and docking hardware product segment during was compounded by the reduction in revenues from sales of certain third party manufactured products distributed by our japanese subsidiary  which were  in compared to million in in early  we were notified that the co ntract under which we sold these products would be ending  and  after the second quarter of  we had no additional sales of these products 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
business restructuring initiatives in response to the cyclical nature of the ate market in which we operate  we have taken various actions to restructure our operations in recent years 
the goal of these actions was to significantly reduce our fixed operating costs and position ourselves to more effectively meet the needs and expectations of the cyclical ate market 
in the past  these restructuring actions have included workforce reductions and facility closures which allowed us to eliminate excess manufacturing capacity at certain of our locations 
additional information regarding the various restructuring plans implemented in recent years  including the costs incurred  is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in early  we commenced a review of our operations to more aggressively streamline our cost structure in line with the current business environment 
as part of this process  we will also focus on methods to increase our profitability worldwide  including pursuing other types of revenue streams and additional growth opportunities 
as a result of this process  we will likely incur restructuring charges in future periods  however  we cannot predict the amount of such charges at this time 
impairment charges generally accepted accounting principles require us to perform at least an annual assessment for impairment of good will and other indefinite life intangible assets and to monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived asset may not be recoverable 
due to the significant operating losses experienced by our manipulator and docking hardware product segment during  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this segment  we determined that our goodwill for this segment which had resulted from prior acquisitions of our foreign subsidiaries in this segment was fully impaired  resulting in a charge of million  and that a charge of  for the impairment of certain property and equipment at our manufacturing facility in cherry hill was appropriate 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued excess and obsolete inventory charges on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the excess and obsolete inventory charges we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
we incurred charges for excess and obsolete inventory of   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of these charges was based upon a variety of factors  including changes in demand for our products and new product designs 
the increase in excess and obsolete inventory charges in reflects the reduced demand for certain of our products  primarily in our manipulator and docking hardware and tester interface product segments 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
during the years ended december   and we utilized   and  respectively  of material in production that had been written off as obsolete in prior periods 
when previously written off inventory material is used in production  it has a zero cost basis and as a result  has the impact of improving our gross margin in the period used 
for the years ended december   and  the use of previously obsoleted inventory materials did not materially change our gross margin 
product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges quarterly  based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  from time to time  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december   and  our product warranty charges recoveries were   and  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the downward trend in our product warranty charges has been driven by a number of factors including recent improvements in product quality 
in addition  warranty claims are typically highest when new products are introduced  and during these years there were no significant sales of newly introduced product families in our manipulator and docking hardware product segment 
the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products  the introduction of new product families which typically have higher levels of warranty claims than existing product families  and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contracted warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
see also critical accounting policies 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is impacted by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we sell most of our products to semiconductor manufacturers and third party test and assembly houses end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
our temperature management product segment also sells into a variety of other industries including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics  defense  and medical industries 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december   and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were  and  respectively 
oem sales generally have a lower gross margin than end user sales  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we have also continued to experience demands from our oem customers supply line managers to reduce our sales prices to them 
if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs  these pricing pressures will continue to reduce our gross and operating margins 
risk factors please see item a risk factors for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each segment 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense impairment of goodwill impairment of long lived assets restructuring and other charges operating income loss other income loss earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense net earnings loss intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
during  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our manipulator and docking hardware and tester interface product segments decreased and  respectively  as compared to  while the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our temperature management product segment remained relatively unchanged 
the decrease in our net revenues reflects lower levels of demand experienced in as compared to by our manipulator and docking hardware and tester interface product segments resulting from the factors previously discussed in the overview 
as previously discussed  sales of our temperature management products have not been as significantly affected as our other products by the changes in demand in the semiconductor industry  in part due to our ability to diversify sales 
gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues 
although the absolute dollar amount of these costs decreased  in as compared to  they were not as fully absorbed during due to the lower net revenue levels as compared to which resulted in these costs increasing to of net revenues in as compared to of net revenues in the  decrease in fixed operating costs was primarily driven by reductions in insurance premiums  lower levels of depreciation  lower salaries and benefits expense and a reduction in facilities costs 
the reduction in insurance premiums primarily reflects the reduction in the volume of business activity in as compared to the decrease in depreciation reflects a lower asset base as of december  compared to december  salaries and benefits expense declined in as compared to as a result of headcount reductions during  primarily in our tester interface product segment 
facilities costs were lower in as compared to primarily as a result of lower utilities and related facilities costs for our temperature management operation in sharon  massachusetts combined with lower rent expense due to a reduction in the size of our facility in cherry hill  new jersey  commencing in october these decreases were partially offset by fixed labor and overhead costs at our machine shops in cherry hill and silicon valley which were not as fully absorbed due to lower volume at these operations during as compared to to a lesser extent  both direct labor and charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased as a percentage of net revenues in as compared to in absolute dollar terms  direct labor declined  during as compared to reflecting reduced headcount 
however  similar to our fixed operating costs  as a result of the reduced revenue levels  these costs were not as fully absorbed in as compared to charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues during as compared to the  increase in the absolute dollar amount of these charges reflects that  as demand remains at reduced levels  more of our inventory is meeting the criteria we use to evaluate whether items in our inventory are excess or obsolete 
the increases in fixed operating costs  direct labor and excess and obsolete inventory charges as a percentage of net revenues were partially offset by a reduction in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues  reflecting changes in product and customer mix 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily driven by lower levels of warranty charges  reflecting favorable claims experience 
to a lesser extent  there was also a reduction in fees paid to third parties for installation of our products at customer sites  primarily in asia  and lower levels of commissions as a result of the lower sales levels 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits expense reflecting increased headcount  primarily at our temperature management and manipulator and docking hardware product segments 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
during  we received  in reimbursement payments for engineering services under a contract with one of the customers of our tester interface product segment 
this reimbursement offset  of salary and benefits expense and expenditures for research and development materials incurred during  as well as reimbursing  of development costs incurred in periods prior to the negotiation of this reimbursement contract 
the reduction in engineering and product development costs in as compared to after excluding the reimbursement of prior period costs from is primarily the result of lower salary and benefits expense  reflecting fewer staff  and a reduction in spending on research and development materials  reflecting fewer new product development projects in the prot otype phase which require increased spending on research and development materials 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in salary and benefits expense which reflects both a  severance payment in to the former managing director of our intestlogic operation as well as the restoration of salaries and benefits in the second and third quarters of that had been reduced in late and early as part of our cost containment initiatives during those years 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in performance based compensation as a result of our overall and segment performance for impairment of goodwill 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our manipulator and docking hardware product segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this product segment  we recorded a charge of million for the full impairment of goodwill related to prior acquisitions made in this product segment 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
there was no similar charge in impairment of long lived assets 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our manipulator and docking hardware product segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this product segment  we recorded a charge of  for the partial impairment of certain long lived assets 
these long lived assets consisted of property and equipment at our cherry hill manufacturing facility 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
there was no similar charge in restructuring and other charges 
there were no restructuring and other charges in restructuring and other charges were  for the restructuring and other charges recorded during related to finalizing the sub lease agreement for the facility where our uk manufacturing operation was located prior to its closure in mid in connection with our current review  we will likely incur restructuring charges in the future  however  we cannot predict the amount at this time 
other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange losses 
during  we recorded a  foreign currency translation adjustment related to the final dissolution of our uk operation which was completed during the fourth quarter of this  gain offset the foreign exchange losses we incurred in in the normal operation of our business 
there was no similar transaction in the increase in foreign exchange losses in as compared to was partially offset by an increase in interest income in as compared to the increase in interest income reflects higher average cash balances as well as an increase in the rate of interest being earned during by some of our operations 
income tax expense 
for  we recorded income tax expense of  compared to million for our effective tax rate was for compared to for due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
during  the income tax expense recorded primarily represents income tax expense on the taxable income of our foreign operations where we do not have a history of operating losses and therefore do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
the reduction in our effective tax rate for compared to reflects that the losses of our domestic operations and certain of our foreign operations represented a larg er proportion of our total results for than in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we believe the increase in our net revenues reflects the higher level of demand experienced in  particularly in the second quarter of the year  compared to weaker cyclical demand during most of during  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our manipulator and docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface product segments increased  and  respectively  as compared to we attribute the larger percentage increase in our manipulator and docking hardware product segment to the aforementioned strong demand for certain third party products in japan 
in addition  we attribute the lower percentage increase in the net revenues of our tester interface product segment to continued strong competition within this market as well as a more significant slowdown in the business of several of the major customers of this segment 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during  our net revenues from customers in the us and asia increased and  respectively  while our net revenues from customers in europe declined over the comparable period in as previously mentioned  during  we closed our uk manufacturing operation 
when adjusted to exclude the sales of our uk operation in  net revenues from customers in europe increased during as compared to the smaller percentage increase for our european customers reflects the fact that sales of temperature management products represent a higher percentage of our total european sales than of our domestic sales  and  as previously discussed  sales of our temperature management products have not been as significantly impacted by the changes in demand in the semiconductor industry 
in addition  the lower percentage increase in sales to european customers can also be attributed to the fact that the sales of our intestlogic operation in southern germany increased only in as compare d to sales of this subsidiary have also been less impacted by the changes in demand within the industry  decreasing only in as compared to we believe this reflects strong customer acceptance of the products manufactured by this subsidiary 
the higher percentage increase for our customers in asia primarily reflects an increase in sales of third party products by our japanese subsidiary as well as increases in sales of temperature management products by our subsidiary in singapore 
in addition  some of the sales which would have historically been generated by our uk manufacturing operation were shifted to the operation in singapore during gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a reduction in our fixed operating costs both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of net revenues 
to a lesser extent  we also had a reduction in charges for excess and obsolete inventory in as compared to in absolute dollar terms  our fixed operating costs decreased  during as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation expense as a result of our lower fixed asset base as of december  compared to december  in addition  there was also a decrease in our insurance premiums which was a result of several factors including the lower fixed asset base  lower total average headcount for certain operations and the closure of our uk manufacturing operation 
the decrease in our fixed operating costs in absolute dollar terms combined with the higher net revenue levels in as compared to led to the overall decrease in fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues from in to in our excess and obsolete inventory charges totaled  or less than of net revenues  for as compared to million  or of net revenues  for we attribute the reduction in excess and obsolete inventory charges primarily to our continued efforts to more closely manage our inventory levels and purchasing policies to minimize our risk in this area 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or less than 
during  there were increases in travel costs  fees paid to third parties for installation of our products at customer sites  primarily in asia  and sales commissions 
the increase in travel costs primarily reflects more overseas trips to visit various customers in asia and europe 
the increase in installation costs primarily represents instances where our internal sales people were not available to perform an installation at a customer site 
in these situations  our practice is to hire a third party to perform the installation for us 
as our overseas business has grown  we have experienced more instances where we do not have internal sales personnel readily available to perform installations overseas 
the increase in sales commissions reflects the increase in the level of sales during as compared to these increases were offset primarily by decreases in e xpenditures related to certain limited duration marketing programs that were in place in early in our temperature management product segment  lower levels of product warranty expense  and a reduction in expenditures for demonstration equipment in as compared to engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to the receipt of reimbursement payments totaling  during the first half of for engineering services under a contract with one of the customers of our tester interface product segment 
under this contract we received payments based on achieving various milestones as defined in the contract related to specified product redesign activities 
this contract ended during the second quarter of in addition  expenditures for third party consultants decreased during as compared to these third party consultants had been retained to assist in new product development efforts during for our tester interface product segment 
these decreases were offset primarily by higher salary and benefits expense and increased spending on research and development materials during as compared to the increase in salary and benefits expense was due to hiring additional staff at our tester interface and temperature management product segments as well as the restoration of certain salaries and benefits 
the increase in staff at our tester interface product segment primarily related to the engineering services contract previously discussed 
when this contract ended  certain staff members were either terminated or  in some cases  re assigned to other projects 
the increase in spending on research and development materials was related to various new product development projects primarily in our temperature management and manipulator and docking hardware product segments 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in salary and benefits expense which reflects the restoration of salaries and benefits in the second and third quarters of  as previously mentioned  as well as the hiring of some additional staff 
to a lesser extent  we incurred additional professional fees related to audit  tax and other compliance work where we utilize the assistance of third party professionals 
the increase in these fees primarily reflects the growing number and complexity of the various accounting and other compliance matters that we encounter in the normal course of running our business 
finally  the amount of performance based compensation we accrued in increased as compared to which reflects our positive results for restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for compared to  for  a decrease of  the restructuring and other charges recorded during related to finalizing the sub lease agreement for the facility where our uk manufacturing operation was located prior to its closure in mid the restructuring and other charges recorded during consisted of  in severance and related costs and  in lease termination costs resulting from the closure of this same operation 
in addition  we incurred  in severance and related costs associated with a workforce reduction at our facility in san jose  california in other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  an increase of  the increase primarily reflects higher interest income  which was the result of both higher average cash balances and an increase in the rate of return earned on such balances  combined with a reduction in foreign exchange transaction losses 
the reduction in foreign exchange transaction losses was primarily the result of a  foreign currency translation adjustment related to the final dissolution of our uk operation which was completed during the fourth quarter of income tax expense 
for  we recorded income tax expense of million compared to  for our effective tax rate was for compared to for due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against all domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
during  the income tax expense recorded primarily represents income tax expense on the taxable income of our foreign operations where we do not have a history of operating losses and therefore do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
the increase in our effective tax rate during as compared to reflects that a higher proportion of our taxable income for was generated by our foreign operations where we do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
in addition  during we recorded an income tax benefit related to a domestic income tax refund we received during the year 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations was  for compared to net cash provided by operations of million for the shift to cash used in operations in from cash provided by operations in was primarily the result of our million net loss in as compared to net earnings of million in the net loss in included non cash charges of million related to the impairment of goodwill and  related to the impairment of long lived assets 
during  accounts receivable decreased million  inventories decreased million and accounts payable decreased million  primarily reflecting the lower level of business activity experienced in as compared to domestic and foreign income taxes payable decreased  compared to the amount at december  due to the payment during of income taxes on earnings generated in by certain of our foreign operations 
in addition  these operations had lower accruals for tax expense in due to lowe r net earnings generated by these operations in as compared to during  accrued warranty decreased  compared to the level at december  reflecting our favorable claims experience 
purchases of property and equipment were  for these purchases primarily consisted of demonstration and quality assurance testing equipment for our facilities in sharon  massachusetts and san jose  california and additional leasehold improvements for our facility in cherry hill  new jersey 
during  we also purchased additional computer and other office equipment for our intestlogic operation in germany and a new vehicle for our temptronic gmbh operation in germany 
during  we received  in proceeds from the sale of certain machine shop equipment by our operation in intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued san jose  california 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we may make such purchases as we deem necessary and appropriate 
net cash provided by financing activities for was  which represents  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  in payments made under capital lease obligations 
on october   we amended the lease for our cherry hill facility to reduce the square footage leased by approximately  square feet  which represented approximately of the total facility square footage 
the annual lease cost for this space would have been approximately  for and under the terms of the original lease would have escalated annually through the end of the lease on august  the average annual cost savings through the end of the original lease term is approximately we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not utilized this facility to borrow any funds 
our usage consists of the issuance of letters of credit in the face amount of  we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of the loan agreement require that we maintain a minimum level of  of domestic cash 
this credit facility expires on september  as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe our cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
should the current downturn be prolonged  or should we utilize significant amounts of cash to implement our acquisition strategy  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to raise such additional financing or upon what terms such financing would be available 
new or recently adopted accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ ma rkedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the charges for excess and obsolete inventory that we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long lived asset valuation we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of our projections  then we would measure the impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based on the e xcess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
at december   identifiable intangibles and long lived assets were million 
during  we recorded a  charge for the partial impairment of certain long lived assets at our cherry hill manufacturing facility 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
goodwill at least annually  we review our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result of this analysis is that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the full impairment of goodwill related to prior acquisitions made in our manipulator and docking hardware product reporting unit 
please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this charge 
as a result of this charge  we no longer have any goodwill on our balance sheet at december  income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
as of december   due to our history of operating losses  we have a valuation allowance aga inst all deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december   accrued warranty was  and we recorded recoveries related to product warranty of  for the year then ended
