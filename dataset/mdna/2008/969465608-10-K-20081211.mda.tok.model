for a discussion of factors affecting our business  see item business in this annual report on form k 
overview during fiscal  we saw our net sales decrease  or primarily due to the continued decline in the nafta market 
our nafta truck sales during fiscal decreased approximately from the prior year 
offsetting the reduction in sales for nafta trucks  we saw a significant increase in sales in fiscal to the asian market of over fiscal levels and an increase in european sales over the prior year 
for the year ended september   we sold approximately of our products in the united states  to canada and mexico for vehicles that are in part produced for the united states market and approximately to other international markets 
in fiscal  we sold approximately of our products in the united states  to canada and mexico for vehicles that are in part produced for the united states market and approximately to other international markets 
net income in fiscal was  compared to net income in fiscal of  as a result of increases in cash flows from operations  we paid down our remaining term loan debt of  in fiscal as we move forward into fiscal and beyond  we will continue to work closely with our existing and potential customers to design and develop new products and adapt existing products to new applications  and to improve the performance  reliability and cost effectiveness of our products

sales to nafta truck customers declined when compared to the same period in fiscal the company s share of this market and unit pricing remained essentially unchanged from the prior year 
sales to our asian and european truck customers increased approximately and  respectively  compared to the twelve months ended september  world wide sales in the off road market declined approximately 
the increases in sales to asian and european truck customers helped to offset a portion of the decline from the north american truck market and worldwide off road market 
we expect that electronic throttle control sales will increase or decrease in the future in line with changes in heavy truck  transit bus and off road production volumes in the various geographic markets in which we serve and increase or decrease when product applications change 
additionally  competitive pricing may continue to reduce per unit pricing 
the change in emissions regulations in the united states  effective january   had a negative impact on truck sales in north america beginning in our second quarter of fiscal and continued through the first half of fiscal in addition  higher fuel costs and other negative economic factors in the united states in negatively impacted the nafta heavy truck market 
in the first fiscal quarter of  we have begun to see a significant reduction in the number of units of trucks  and to a lesser degree off road vehicles  built world wide due to the significant recessionary pressures in the united states and portions of the rest of the world 
a number of our large truck oem customers have publicly announced reductions in build rates which will impact our sales to those customers 
it is uncertain how protracted or severe the current financial situation will be world wide and the impact it may have on the company 
net sales decreased  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   primarily due to an overall decrease of in sales volumes of electronic throttle control systems in the north american market 
overall  in the north american market  sales to truck customers were down approximately while increasing sales in the off road markets offset some of that decline 
decreases in north american sales volumes were partially offset by increases of in sales volumes in both the european and asian markets 
percent change to to for the year ended september gross profit    gross profit was  or  of net sales for the year ended september   a decrease of from the gross profit of  or  of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal is primarily driven by the net decrease in sales of electronic throttle control systems to north american heavy truck customers 
beginning in late fiscal  we began to see a decline in the order rates from some of our principal truck oem s due to recessionary pressures in the united states and other portions of the world 
that  combined with the public announcement of reduced truck  and to a lesser degree off road vehicle  build rates in early fiscal could negatively impact our sales and gross profit margins in fiscal during fiscal  we substantially completed our realignment of operations  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and as a result of this realignment we have experienced an overall reduction in labor costs and net material costs due to continued efforts in global sourcing and the production of our own internally developed contacting and non contacting sensors 
throughout fiscal and the majority of fiscal  gross profit was negatively impacted by higher purchase prices for certain raw materials 
overhead expenses decreased between periods  but increased slightly as a percentage of sales 
gross profit was  or  of net sales for the year ended september   a decrease of  from the gross profit of  or  of net sales in the comparable fiscal period 
the decrease in gross profit in fiscal is primarily driven by a decrease in sales of electronic throttle and pneumatic control systems to north american heavy truck customers offset by an increase in sales to transit bus and off road customers in north america and higher sales volumes in other foreign markets 
during fiscal  we substantially completed our realignment of operations  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  and as a result of this realignment we have experienced an overall reduction in labor costs and material costs due to continued efforts in global sourcing and the production of our own internally developed contacting and non contacting sensors 
offsetting these realignment and sourcing savings  gross profit was negatively impacted by significantly higher purchase prices for certain raw materials  an increase in freight costs resulting from our global sourcing efforts  and an overall increase in overhead expenses primarily due to the costs associated with our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
percent change to to for the year ended september research and development    research and development expenses increased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal the company s research and development expenditures will fluctuate based on the programs and products under development at any given point in time 
the increase in research and development expense is primarily attributable to operating our conceptual development center  which was completed in mid fiscal overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase over fiscal levels due to additional new product design projects and a full year of the conceptual development center 
research and development expenses decreased for the year ended september  compared to the same period in fiscal this decrease in research and development expense is primarily attributable to the timing of projects in development 
percent change to to for the year ended september selling    selling expenses increased for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in fiscal mainly due to higher overall salaries and expanded selling and marketing efforts  including expenses associated with sales and marketing related travel in the european  russian  chinese  south american and australian markets and increased emphasis in off road markets world wide

percent change to to for the year ended september income tax expense    in fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the overall tax rate was in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the united states domestic manufacturing credit and a larger percentage of the company s earnings being taxed at the lower chinese tax rate 
the increase in tax rate from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in our state tax rate and the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion at the end of calendar financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations was  for the year ended september   an increase of  from the cash generated from operations of  for the year ended september  current year cash flows from operations included net income of  and a non cash deferred tax provision of cash flows from operations for the year ended september  included net income of  and a non cash deferred tax provision of changes in working capital items used cash of for the year ended september  compared to a  use of cash in the corresponding prior year period 
timing of collections on receivables and higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal versus fiscal resulted in a use of cash of  in fiscal compared with an increase in cash of due to the timing of the collection of receivables in the same period of fiscal cash was used to increase inventory levels during fiscal and the first half of fiscal to facilitate switching of suppliers to lower cost suppliers  primarily in china  the realignment efforts and to support increasing operations in our suzhou  china manufacturing facility 
we feel that inventory levels reached their maximum levels in mid fiscal and continue to decline as supplier switching and the realignment efforts have been completed 
for the year ended september  changes in inventory generated cash of compared to a generation of cash of for the year ended september  cash flows for the years ended september  and included payments to fund our pension plans of  and  respectively 
although the recessionary pressures in the united states and world wide will have an uncertain impact on our future cash flow  we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from continuing operations 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended september  and included  of purchases of property  plant and equipment offset slightly by of proceeds from the sales of property  plant and equipment 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended september  and included  of purchases of property  plant and equipment offset slightly by of proceeds from the sales of property  plant and equipment 
we expect our cash use for investing activities to at least remain constant and potentially increase in the future as we continue to purchase capital equipment to expand and support our operations worldwide 
we currently anticipate spending approximately  in capital expenditures for the year ended september  cash used in financing activities was for the year ended september   compared to cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended september  the use of cash for financing activities for fiscal primarily relates to the payoff of our merrill lynch term loan of  partially offset by cash proceeds of from the exercise of stock options 
the use of cash for financing activities for fiscal primarily relates to the payment of  related to the fiscal excess cash flow requirement of our loan agreement with merrill lynch  scheduled quarterly debt payments on our merrill lynch term loan and an additional term loan payments of  additionally  we received cash proceeds of from the exercise of stock options 
at september   we had  available under our revolving credit facility plus cash and cash equivalents at september  of  we were not compliant with one financial covenant at september  and this non compliance could limit our ability to borrow against the  available under the revolving credit facility 
we have not obtained a waiver with our lender ge capital as of the filing of these financial statements  however  we believe when our cash on hand is combined with cash provided by operations  it will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs on a short term and long term basis as well as our capital expenditure needs 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized the purchase  from time to time  of up to  of shares of the company s common stock 
repurchases may be made in the open market or through block trades  in compliance with securities and exchange commission guidelines  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
the company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the repurchase program and the timing  actual number and price of shares to be purchased will depend on the performance of the company s stock price  general market conditions  and various other factors within the discretion of management 
as of the filing of these financial statements  we have repurchased approximately  shares of common stock at a total value of approximately contractual obligations as of september  at september   our contractual obligations consisted of operating lease obligations and a license agreement 
we do not have any material letters of credit  purchase commitments  or debt guarantees outstanding at september  maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases   mmt license minimum royalties certain liabilities  including those related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans  are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets but are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of stated maturities 
we have net obligations at september  related to our pension plans and post retirement medical plan of  and  respectively

in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a debtor can only relieve itself of a liability if it has been extinguished 
accordingly  a liability is considered extinguished if a the debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its obligation for the liability or b the debtor is legally released from being the primary obligor under the liability  either judicially or by the creditor 
during the years ended september  and  the company was judicially released from and reversed and  respectively  of old accounts payable resulting in a gain  which has been recorded in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
no amounts were released and reversed during fiscal the company expects to reverse amounts in future periods based on the recognition of the liabilities being judicially released in accordance with sfas no 
of in fiscal  and in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment  which is when title and risk of loss transfers to customers  and when all of the following have occurred a firm sales agreement is in place  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are reported net of estimated returns  rebates and customer discounts 
discounts and rebates are recorded during the period they are earned by the customer 
warranty we provide a warranty covering defects arising from products sold 
the product warranty liability is based on historical return rates of products and amounts for significant and specific warranty issues 
the warranty is limited to a specified time period  mileage or hours of use  and varies by product  application and customer 
the company has recorded a warranty liability  which in the opinion of management is adequate to cover such costs 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  they are subject to change and such change could be material 
legal we are involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings from time to time 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
in connection with such claims and lawsuits  we estimate the probability of losses based on advice of legal counsel  the outcomes of similar litigation  legislative development and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
we expense legal expenses related to claims in the period incurred 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental we estimate the costs of investigation and remediation for certain soil and groundwater contaminants at our portland  oregon facility 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of this site cannot be predicted with certainty due to the often unknown magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to accomplish such cleanups and the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations 
the company has recognized a liability for environmental remediation costs for this site in an amount that management believes is probable and reasonably estimable 
when the estimate of a probable loss is within a range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued when no estimate within the range is better than another 
in making these judgments and assumptions  the company considers  among other things  the activity to date at the site and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
the company regularly monitors its exposure to environmental loss contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimated liability accrual will occur in the near future 
pensions and post retirement benefit obligations pension and post retirement benefit obligations and net period benefit cost are calculated using actuarial models 
the most important assumptions that affect these computations are the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated at least annually and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
to determine our discount rate  we discounted the expected benefit payments using the citigroup pension discount liability index yield curve 
the equivalent level interest rate that produces the same present value of benefits was then determined 
our assumed rate does not differ significantly from this benchmark rate 
we assumed a discount rate of to determine our pension benefit obligations at september  and a rate of to determine our net periodic benefit cost in fiscal a decrease in these discount rates would have increased our pension benefit obligations at the end of fiscal by  and increased our net periodic benefit cost in by a increase in discount rates would have decreased our pension obligations at september  by  and decreased our net periodic benefit cost in by to determine the discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan  we also discounted the expected benefit payments using the citigroup pension discount liability index yield curve 
a decrease in discount rate for our post retirement benefit plan would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased our post retirement benefit expense in by a increase in discount rate would have decreased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and decreased our post retirement benefit expense in by to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current asset allocations and the historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets obtained from our investment portfolio manager 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have impacted net periodic benefit cost in fiscal by our post retirement plan does not contain any plan assets 
we assumed healthcare cost trend rates for our post retirement plan of in  decreasing gradually to in and remaining at thereafter 
a increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have increased our post retirement benefit obligation at september  by and increased post retirement benefit expense in by a decrease in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have decreased the post retirement benefit obligation by at the end of fiscal and decreased post retirement benefit expense in by stock based compensation expense we use sfas no 
r for computing share based compensation expense  which requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards  and awards we grant  modify  repurchase or cancel in the future  at fair value and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when calculating fair value including estimated stock price volatility  expected term and expected forfeitures 
factors considered in estimating forfeitures include the types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
income taxes for each jurisdiction that we operate in  we are required to estimate our annual effective tax rate together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and unless we believe that recovery is more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
our income tax provision on the consolidated statement of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
this process is complex and involves significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of investments 
the company s primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate risk the company has a revolving loan agreement with its primary lender merrill lynch  which expires on september  in october  ge capital assumed the loan as successor to merrill lynch 
interest rates under the agreement are variable and are based on the election of the company of either a libor rate or prime rate 
as of september   there was no balance outstanding on the term loan and the revolving loan 
the company does not believe that a hypothetical change in end of the period interest rates or changes in future interest rates on these variable rate obligations would have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company has not hedged its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
foreign currency risk we sell our products to customers in the heavy truck  transit bus and off road equipment industries 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  the company had foreign sales of approximately and of net sales  respectively 
all worldwide sales in fiscal and  with the exception of  and  respectively  were denominated in us dollars 
during fiscal  we established a manufacturing facility in suzhou  china and we opened sales offices in shanghai  china and ismaning munich  germany 
we purchase components internationally for use in both our products whose sales are denominated in us dollars and other currencies 
although the company is expanding its international exposure  it does not believe that changes in future exchange rates would have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows at this time 
as a result  the company has not entered into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions to hedge against foreign currency risk 
the company will continue to assess its foreign currency risk as its international operations  international purchases and sales increase 
investment risk the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable and long term obligations 
the company s cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are short term in nature  and  thus  the company believes they are not exposed to material investment risk
