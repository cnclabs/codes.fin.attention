general we reported revenues of billion in  including billion from our newly acquired subsidiary  advo  inc we experienced a significant shift in the share of revenue contributed by each segment of our business resulting from the acquisition of advo  inc in the first quarter of the fsi accounted for of total revenue in compared to in the prior year 
in  the fsi was the largest contributor to the company s revenue base 
in  it ranks third behind the shared mail segment advo  which accounts for approximately and the neighborhood targeted segment  which accounts for approximately 
year ended december  approximate share of revenue by segment shared mail advo neighborhood targeted fsi international services household targeted this shift reflects our strategy to further diversify our products and services 
the advo acquisition supports this strategy  and going forward we will blend shared mail distribution with newspaper delivery to further enhance our diversified distribution methods and offer clients delivery of our redplum branded product portfolio across an expanded multi media platform 
our efforts have been focused on the expansion of our us based business in the shared mail arena  opportunities to cross sell our portfolio of products and services to both current and prospective clients  blending of our distribution methods  and advancing targeting capabilities 
we expect to launch a proprietary targeting process in the marketplace during the second quarter of to further differentiate valassis in the marketplace 
the cooperative fsi industry experienced a unit page decline in performance in the fsi segment also continued to be negatively impacted by a decline in fsi pricing in management anticipates decreased fsi margin from price pressure resulting from an aggressive competitive environment and increased paper costs in due to the multi year nature of fsi contracts  the economic impact of the competitive pricing environment will continue into future periods even if the pricing environment were to improve in the near future 
paper represents a significant portion of the cost of our printed products 
we purchase a combination of coated and uncoated paper 
to protect us against the risk of price fluctuations  a significant portion of our paper requirements is purchased from three paper companies under long term contracts 
these contracts limit the amount of increases or decreases to approximately in any month period of our cost of paper purchased from these suppliers 
such cost can be adjusted quarterly 
the remainder of our paper requirements is bought pursuant to contracts that are typically three to six months in duration or on a spot basis 
we expect the cost of paper to increase in impacting the profitability of our fsi and shared mail products 
while we believe there continues to be growth opportunities in the u 
s  we are also expanding our geographic reach by testing new media products in europe and making investments in asia 
in  we continued to expand our new media products in france  germany and spain  while continuing to test in italy

revenue in was billion 
operating costs cost of sales was billion in compared to million in and million in  increasing as a percentage of revenue each year 
gross profit in was  compared to in and in the continued decrease in gross profit percentage in compared to and was primarily the result of competitive pricing issues in the fsi segment 
additionally  the gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by a change in mix resulting in a larger percentage of sales from lower margin products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in to million from million in  primarily as the result of the inclusion of advo operations which contributed million to sg a in the remaining increase in is due to million in charges related to european restructurings  million in costs related to the advo acquisition  million in software writeoffs and increased incentive compensation  offset by non recurring charges in of million described below 
sg a expenses increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily the result of million in legal and professional expenses related to the merger agreement and litigation between valassis and advo incurred during as well as million in expenses related to the close down of the french agency business and esettlement business unit of nch and million in stock option expense 
some of this increased expense was offset by declines in incentive compensation and headcount reductions made at the end of in  restructuring charges of million were recorded related to the full integration of the components of our household targeted business segment  which resulted in the elimination of prevision as a stand alone entity  right sizing of coupon clearing operations primarily in europe and other efficiency related headcount reductions 
non operating items interest expense was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in as compared to is the result of the financing of the advo acquisition resulting in billion of new debt 
the increase in expense in as compared to is due largely to million in charges related to the termination of a million interest rate swap contract and premiums paid for two separate million interest rate swaption contracts 
these contracts were entered into as a bridge hedge for a portion of the acquisition financing related to the advo acquisition 
income taxes income tax expense represents of earnings before income taxes in compared to in and in the decrease in effective tax rate in was the result of favorable settlements and additional deductions related to acquisition costs 
the increase in the effective tax rate in is the result of the majority of the million in legal and professional expenses incurred in related to the litigation between valassis and advo  which was settled in december  being considered non deductible 
net earnings net earnings were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase is primarily due to the inclusion of the operations of advo  since march  which contributed segment profit of million  offset by increased interest expense related to the debt incurred to finance the acquisition

segment results shared mail advo shared mail advo revenue from the acquisition date of march  to december  was billion 
these results were achieved despite the elimination of the detached label card and a reduction in packages due to business optimization efforts which negatively affected revenue 
during the second quarter  we eliminated the use of the detached label card to printing the consumer address on the redplum wrap formerly shopwise wrap 
although the business optimization efforts to reduce unprofitable packages negatively affected top line revenue growth  it conversely had a positive impact to gross profit by reducing over supply and delivering more profitable packages 
the business optimization efforts along with the reduction of fixed and variable costs  cost synergies  and reduced client credits and bad debt write offs resulted in shared mail segment profit of million from the acquisition date of march  to december  neighborhood targeted neighborhood targeted revenue increased in to million versus million in the primary cause of this increase was additional spending within the telecommunications  financial and retail client verticals 
the segment also experienced improved pricing and increased margins 
segment profit increased to million in versus million in neighborhood targeted revenue decreased in to million versus million in the major driver of this decrease was pull backs in spending due to consolidations within the telecommunications and appliance manufacturing sectors 
fsi in  fsi revenue decreased to million compared to the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of an approximate decline in fsi pricing  slightly offset by a small gain in market share 
cooperative fsi industry pages were flat in compared to fsi unit costs were down slightly from fsi segment profit was million in versus million in as a result of the price decline 
in  fsi revenue decreased to million compared to the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a decline in average pricing of approximately as the intense competitive pricing environment continued in this segment 
in addition  although industry volume was up approximately  a slight decline in our market share resulted in a reduction in our pages produced 
fsi unit costs were down approximately from as a result of reductions in the cost of paper  media insertion and printing 
fsi segment profit was million in versus million in due primarily to pricing 
international services the international services segment contributed revenues of million in  a increase over million in due to strong coupon clearing volumes in the united states and the united kingdom and increased media activity in france and germany 
segment profit for the year was million  after incurring million in non recurring costs related to restructurings in europe 
international services revenue increased in to million from million in this increase was primarily the result of increased revenues from new media products in france 
in addition  revenues from canada grew as more solo preprint programs were run in segment profit declined to million in from million in as the result of a million charge relating to the close down of the french agency business and the esettlement business unit of nch

financial condition  liquidity and sources of capital we consider such factors as current assets  current liabilities  revenues  operating income  cash flows from operations  investing activities and financing activities when assessing liquidity 
our liquidity requirements arise mainly from our working capital needs  primarily accounts receivable  inventory and debt service requirements 
our senior secured credit facility and operating cash flows are our primary source of liquidity and are expected to be used for among other things interest and principal payments on debt obligations and capital expenditures necessary to support growth and productivity improvement

for the period ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million versus million for the period ended december  a decrease of million in net income along with significant changes in working capital assets and liabilities accounted for this change 
the change in working capital items was primarily due to an increase in days outstanding in rop receivables that was not fully offset by an increase in the corresponding payables to the newspaper

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations  and which require them to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements included in item valassis does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets historically have been reviewed for impairment at least annually in december and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
revenue recognition shared mail advo revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists and when services are rendered 
shared mail services are considered rendered when all printing  sorting  labeling and ancillary services have been provided and the package has been shipped and accepted by the usps 
there is no risk pertaining to customer acceptance and the sales arrangement specifies a fixed and determinable price and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an allowance for sales adjustments to estimate claims resulting from billing and sales adjustments in the event of incorrect invoicing  pricing disputes or untimely mailings of customers advertising material 
the amount of this reserve is evaluated monthly taking into account historical trends  specific items and trended sales adjustments 
neighborhood targeted the majority of neighborhood targeted products are newspaper delivered  and revenue is recognized in the period that the product is distributed 
for non newspaper delivered products  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or distributed to the consumer via direct to door 
rop revenue is recognized on the date that the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
some customers have contracts whereby we earn a transaction fee and the media costs are pass through costs to the customer 
in such cases  we only recognize the transaction fee as revenue on the date the advertisement runs in the newspaper 
customer contracts can vary  which may lead to material changes in revenue recognized for this segment  while not materially affecting absolute gross margin dollars 
fsi revenue from fsis and custom cooperative fsis is recognized in the period that the product is distributed in the newspaper or shared mail 
in accordance with industry practice  we generally pre bill fsi customers except remnant space in advance of the related distribution date

provision for rebates or pricing adjustments is made at the time that the related revenue is recognized

accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure along with assessing the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of our future taxable income levels could result in the realization of deferred tax assets being materially different from amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item reserves for taxes are established for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
these tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect valassis potential liability for additional taxes  such as conclusion of tax audits  identification of new issues  changes in federal or state laws or interpretations of the law 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments  including forward foreign exchange and interest rate swap contracts  to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments mitigates exposure to these risks with the intent of reducing the risks and the variability of our operating results 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
under sfas  all derivatives are recorded at fair value and the changes in fair value are immediately included in earnings if the derivatives do not qualify as effective hedges 
if a derivative is a fair value hedge  then changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item 
if a derivative is a cash flow hedge  then changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
effective derivatives are recorded at fair value in other current and long term assets and other current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this process includes linking derivatives that are designated as hedges of specific assets  liabilities  firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether a derivative used in a hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
hedge ineffectiveness  determined in accordance with sfas no 
 did not have a material impact on operations for  or other matters we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities
