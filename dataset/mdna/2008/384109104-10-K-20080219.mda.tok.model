critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the company s most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual amounts will differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
sales returns 
an allowance is established for possible return of products 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
also  the company s written agreements with distributors typically limit the amount that may be returned 
from time to time  the company may choose to terminate a distributor relationship and may take back inventory 
these are considered period events and not included in the allowance for returns 
although management considers these balances adequate  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
excess and discontinued inventory 
the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for excess and discontinued product are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these balances adequate  changes in sales volumes due to unanticipated economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
product warranty 
a liability is established for estimated warranty claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales 
the company estimates these costs based on historical claim experience  changes in warranty programs and other factors  including evaluating specific product warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for goodwill  the company performs impairment reviews for the company s reporting units  which have been determined to be the company s divisions using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units by an allocation of market capitalization value  cross checked by a present value of future cash flows calculation 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
the company also performs a separate impairment test for each other intangible asset with indefinite life  based on estimated future use and discounting estimated future cash flows 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests 
though management considers its judgments and assumptions to be reasonable  changes in product offerings or marketing strategies could change the estimated fair values and result in impairment charges 
self insured retentions 
the company purchases insurance for products liability  workers compensation and employee medical benefits with high deductibles 
third party insurance is carried for what is believed to be the major portion of potential exposures that would exceed the company s self insured retentions 
the company has established liabilities for potential uninsured claims  including estimated costs and legal fees 
the company employs actuaries to assist in evaluating its potential ultimate exposure for uninsured claims and then considers factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  sales trends and other relevant factors in setting the liabilities 
though management considers these balances adequate  a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims would result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
liabilities for uncertain tax positions are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal  state and international issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that liabilities are properly stated 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits 
retirement obligations 
the measurements of the company s pension and postretirement medical obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions including estimates of the present value of projected future payments  taking into consideration future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an impact on the expense and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates for pension obligations include discount rates  inflation  salary increases  retirement rates  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates for postretirement medical obligations include discount rates  rate of future increase in medical costs and participation rates 
for us plans  the company establishes its discount rate assumption by reference to the citigroup pension liability index  a published index commonly used as a benchmark 
for plans outside of the us  the company establishes a rate by country by reference to highly rated corporate bonds 
these reference points have been determined to adequately match expected plan cash flows 
the company bases its inflation assumption on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary assumptions are based on actual historical experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement rates are based on experience 
the investment return assumption is based on the expected long term performance of plan assets 
in setting this number  the company considers the input of actuaries and investment advisors  its long term historical returns  the allocation of plan assets  and projected returns on plan assets 
mortality rates are based on a common group mortality table for males and females 
net pension credit in was million and was allocated to cost of products sold and operating expenses based on salaries and wages 
at december   a one half percentage point decrease in the indicated assumptions would have the following effects in millions assumption funded status expense discount rate expected return on assets recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures on fair market value measurements 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities in with respect to non financial assets and liabilities  the statement is effective for the company starting in fiscal the impact of the initial adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company has not determined the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement as it pertains to non financial assets and liabilities will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar and pays variable interest rates on borrowings under its primary credit facility 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange and interest rate movements 
the company may use a variety of financial and derivative instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company may use forward exchange contracts  options and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from anticipated currency transactions and net monetary asset and liability positions 
at december   the currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound and korean won 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of currency rate changes  however  the direct translation effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
when compared to results  the weaker us dollar versus other currencies helped to increase sales and net earnings 
for the year ended december  the impact of currency translation resulted in a calculated increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the calculated impact of currency translation resulted in an increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
in the company entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the rates paid on a total of million of variable rate borrowings under the company s primary credit facility 
the contracts fix the rates at approximately percent through outlook the company is expecting higher net sales and net earnings in management believes that economic conditions in the us will remain challenging in  particularly in markets related to the housing industry 
however  the company anticipates that sales activity outside of the americas will continue to be solid and that most of the company s major markets will continue to experience favorable economic conditions 
the company s backlog is typically small compared to annual sales and is not a good indicator of future business levels 
in addition to economic growth  the improved sales outlook is dependent upon many factors  including the successful launch of new products  expanding distribution coverage  realization of price increases and stable foreign currency exchange rates 
the earnings outlook assumes higher sales  continued improvements in manufacturing which help offset cost increases including higher material prices  the continued disciplined management of operating expenses and the successful management and integration of acquisitions 
the company expects its effective tax rate will be approximately percent 
the tax rate in any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by developments in the specific quarter 
forward looking statements a forward looking statement is any statement made in this report and other reports that the company files periodically with the securities and exchange commission  or in press or earnings releases  analyst briefings  conference calls and the company s annual report to shareholders which reflects the company s current thinking on market trends and the company s future financial performance at the time they are made 
all forecasts and projections are forward looking statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of by making cautionary statements concerning any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company cannot give any assurance that the results forecasted in any forward looking statement will actually be achieved 
future results could differ materially from those expressed  due to the impact of changes in various factors 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the united states and other major world economies  currency fluctuations  political instability  changes in laws and regulations  and changes in product demand 
please refer to item a of  and exhibit to  the company s annual report on form k for fiscal year for a more comprehensive discussion of these and other risk factors 
investors should realize that factors other than those identified above and in item a and exhibit might prove important to the company s future results 
it is not possible for management to identify each and every factor that may have an impact on the company s operations in the future as new factors can develop from time to time
