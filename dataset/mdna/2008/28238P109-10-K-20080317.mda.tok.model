item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading online source of health insurance for individuals  families and small businesses 
our ecommerce platform enables individuals  families and small businesses to research  analyze  compare and purchase health insurance products that best meet their needs 
our technology also enables us to communicate electronically with our insurance carrier partners and process consumers health insurance applications online 
as a result  we simplify and streamline the complex and traditionally paper intensive health insurance sales and purchasing process 
since our incorporation in november  we have spent a significant amount on technology and content related to our ecommerce platform 
we have also invested significant time and resources in obtaining licenses to sell health insurance in all states and the district of columbia  developing diverse and successful member acquisition programs and establishing relationships with over leading insurance carriers  enabling us to offer thousands of health insurance products online 
our first online transaction relating to the sale of a health insurance policy was completed during the fourth quarter of our financial model is characterized by recurring revenue  an average member product life that exceeds two years estimated on a revenue weighted average basis for all products purchased through us  including short term products that are on average held for less than four months and health insurance pricing that is set by each health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators 
we generate revenue primarily from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers whose policies are purchased through us by individuals  families and small businesses 
we typically receive commission payments on a monthly basis for as long as a policy remains active 
as a result  much of our revenue for a given financial reporting period relates to policies that we sold prior to the beginning of the period and is recurring in nature 
because health insurance pricing is set by the carrier and approved by state regulators  health insurance pricing is fixed 
we  therefore  are not generally subject to negotiation or discounting of prices by health insurance carriers or our competitors 
sources of revenue revenue we generate most of our revenue from commissions paid to us by health insurance carriers whose health insurance policies we have sold 
commission revenue represented  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the remainder of our revenue is primarily attributable to carrier sponsorship advertising on our website and licensing arrangements related to our technology 
our commission revenue has grown principally as a result of our penetration of the individual  family and small business health insurance markets and corresponding growth in our membership 
we estimate that as of december  we had approximately  members compared to an estimated  members at december  we define a member as an individual covered by an insurance product for which we are entitled to receive compensation 
we believe our revenue and business have been more significantly affected historically by the rate of growth in the number of consumers using the internet to research and purchase health insurance than by the rate at which the health insurance industry has grown 
we expect that the rate of online adoption will continue to be a primary driver of our revenue 
our commission revenue generally represents a percentage of the insurance premium a member has paid to his or her insurance carrier and  to a lesser extent  commission override payments that insurance carriers pay us for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives 
commission rates vary by carrier and by the type of plan purchased by a member 
commission rates also can vary based upon the amount of time that the policy has been active  with commission rates for individual and family policies typically being higher in the first twelve months of the policy 
after the first twelve months  commission rates generally decline significantly 
as a result  
table of contents if we do not add a sufficient number of members on new policies  our revenue growth may be negatively impacted 
individuals  families and small businesses purchasing health insurance through us typically pay their premiums on a monthly basis 
insurance carriers typically pay us our commissions monthly  after they receive the premium payment from the member 
we generally continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
as a result  the majority of our revenue is recurring in nature and grows in correlation with the growth we experience in our membership base 
we recognize commission revenue when our commission is reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an allowance for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we generally receive these communications simultaneously 
in instances when we receive the cash payment and commission statement separately and in different accounting periods  we recognize revenue in the period that we receive the earliest communication  provided we receive the second communication corroborating the amount reported in the first communication within ten business days 
if the second corroborating communication is not received within ten business days  we recognize revenue in the period the second communication is received 
we use the data in the commission statement to identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate our allowance for forfeitures 
insurance carriers typically pay us cash commission payments monthly  after they receive the premium payment from the member and we generally continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
commission override payments  which are recognized on the same basis as premium commissions  are generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenue for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override payments 
revenue attributable to individual and family product offerings in the years ended december  and represented approximately and of our commission revenue  respectively 
we define individual and family product offerings as major medical individual and family health insurance plans  which does not include small business  short term major medical  stand alone dental  life and student health insurance product offerings 
in addition to the commission revenue we derive from the sale of health insurance products  we derive revenue from our online sponsorship advertising program and from licensing the use of our ecommerce technology 
our sponsorship advertising program allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
specifically  carriers who have purchased advertising can choose to have specific health insurance plans displayed prominently after a consumer has entered certain census information 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee and a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted or approved health insurance applications 
our technology licensing business allows carriers to offer their own health insurance policies on their websites and agents to utilize our technology to power their online quoting  content and application submission processes 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party 
in addition  we typically generate revenue based on performance criteria that is either measured based on data that is tracked by us  or based on data that is tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
member acquisition an important factor in our revenue growth is the growth of our member base 
our marketing initiatives are an important component of our strategy to grow our member base and are focused on three primary member 
table of contents acquisition channels direct  marketing partners and online advertising 
our marketing initiatives are designed to attract consumers to complete an online application for health insurance on our ecommerce platform 
direct 
our direct member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website addresses www 
ehealth 
com and www 
ehealthinsurance 
com either directly or through algorithmic search listings on internet search engines and directories 
for each of the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance from our direct channel constituted of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
marketing partners 
our marketing partner member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website through a network of financial services and other companies 
growth in our marketing partner channel depends upon our expanding joint marketing programs with existing partners and adding new partners to our network 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance products for which we paid fees to our marketing partners constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
our marketing partner channel is the primary driver of our small business member acquisition 
online advertising 
our online advertising channel consists of consumers who access our website through paid keyword search advertising from search engines such as google  msn and yahoo  as well as various internet marketing programs such as banner advertising  email marketing and an integrated partnership with msn 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance products from our online advertising channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
operating costs and expenses cost of revenue sharing cost of revenue sharing consists primarily of payments related to health insurance policies sold to members who were referred to our website by marketing partners with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements 
in order to enter into a revenue sharing arrangement  these marketing partners must be licensed to sell health insurance in the state where the policy is sold 
costs related to revenue sharing arrangements are expensed as the related revenue is recognized 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expenses consist primarily of member acquisition expenses associated with our direct  marketing partner and online advertising channels  in addition to compensation and other expenses related to marketing  business development  public relations and carrier relations personnel who support our offerings 
our direct channel expenses primarily consist of print advertising  direct mail  email and other activities that drive consumers directly to our website 
we generally compensate our marketing partners by paying a one time fee each time a consumer referral from a partner results in a submitted health insurance application on our ecommerce platform  regardless of whether the consumer s application is approved by the health insurance carrier 
many of our marketing partners have tiered volume incentive arrangements in which the amount of the one time fee increases as the volume of submitted applications we receive from such marketing partners increases over a particular period 
we recognize these expenditures in the period when a marketing partner s referral results in the submission of a health insurance application on our website 
the number of health insurance applications submitted through our ecommerce platform has generally increased in our first quarter compared to our fourth quarter and in our third quarter compared to our second quarter 
conversely  we have generally experienced a decline or flattening in submitted applications in our second quarter compared to our first quarter and in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter 
since a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number 
table of contents of health insurance applications submitted on our website  those expenses generally have increased or decreased in conjunction with these seasonal patterns 
in addition  because the total volume of submitted applications that we receive from our marketing partners is largely outside of our control  particularly during any short term period  and because of our tiered volume incentive marketing partner arrangements  we could incur expenses in excess of the amounts we had planned in periods of rapid growth in the volume of submitted applications from marketing partner referrals 
accordingly  an unanticipated increase in submitted applications resulting from marketing partner referrals could cause our net income to be lower than our expectation since the revenue to be derived from submitted applications that are approved by health insurance carriers will not be recognized until future periods 
paid keyword search advertising on search engines represents the majority of expenses in our online advertising channel 
we incur expenses associated with search engine advertising in the period in which the consumer clicks on the advertisement 
we actively manage our paid keyword search advertising expense  taking into account the anticipated return from referrals 
we also take into account the productivity and relative cost of paid keyword search as compared to other marketing channels and the anticipated lifetime revenue from members acquired  to control the amount of expense incurred during a given period 
we expect the average cost of acquiring new members to increase in compared to as a result of several factors  including an increase in the amounts we spend on direct advertising and online marketing programs including paid keyword search advertising and an increase in stock based compensation costs from additional equity grants to marketing and advertising employees 
other factors that may impact the average cost of acquiring new members include the mix of health insurance applications submitted through our three marketing channels  the mix of marketing partners referring consumers to our website  the overall trend in costs of online marketing  seasonality patterns  the amounts we pay marketing partners to refer consumers to our website  our participation in cooperative advertising programs in which we receive reimbursements from certain health insurance carriers for a portion of our advertising costs and fluctuations in the percentage of consumers referred to our website who submit health insurance applications 
we also participate in cooperative advertising programs with some of our health insurance carrier partners whereby they reimburse us for a portion of our advertising costs related to carrier specific marketing activities 
the amount of the reimbursement is typically determined at the beginning of each year and we are able to choose when to advertise and receive the related reimbursement throughout the year 
as a result  our decision to use these amounts in a particular period could reduce our marketing and advertising expenses  as well as our cost of member acquisition  for that period 
although we are participating in cooperative advertising programs during  we may not be offered the opportunity to participate in future years 
additionally  we may explore new marketing initiatives that increase per member acquisition costs as part of our efforts to drive more consumers to our website 
due to the departure of an executive officer in may who was not replaced  we reorganized the responsibilities of certain personnel in the second half of as a result  certain compensation  benefit and related expenses that were previously included in marketing and advertising on our consolidated statements of operations were allocated to other functions starting in the second half of the net impact of the reorganization was to include million and million of compensation  benefit and related expense in our technology and content  customer care and enrollment and general and administrative expenses during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  that would have remained as marketing and advertising expenses had the responsibilities of these personnel not changed 
customer care and enrollment customer care and enrollment expenses primarily consist of compensation and related expenses for personnel engaged in pre sales assistance to applicants who call our customer care center and enrollment personnel who assist applicants during the underwriting process 

table of contents technology and content technology and content expenses consist primarily of compensation and related expenses for personnel associated with developing and enhancing our website technology as well as maintaining our website 
a portion of our technology and content group is located at our wholly owned subsidiary in china  where technology development costs are generally lower than in the united states 
our technology and content expenses incurred in china totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses for staff working in our finance  legal  human resources  internal audit  facilities and internal information technology departments 
these expenses also include fees paid for outside professional services  mainly for audit  tax  legal and information technology consulting

our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums that our members pay 
our carrier partners do not report to us the number of members that we have as of a given date 
the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier instead of by informing us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
given the number of months required to observe non payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations  we estimate the number of members who are active on insurance policies as of a given date 
we estimate the number of continuing members on individual and family insurance policies as of a specific date by taking the sum of i the number of members for whom we have received a commission payment for the month that is six months three months for short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation reduced using historical experience for assumed cancellations over the three month or six month period  and ii the number of approved members over the six month period three months for short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation reduced using historical experience for members who do not accept their approved policy and for estimated cancellations through the date of the estimate 
we estimate the number of small business group members using the number of initial members at the time the group is approved and we update this number for changes in membership to the extent that they are reported to us by the group or carrier 
however  groups generally notify the carrier directly of policy cancellations and increases or decreases in group size without informing us 
additionally  our carrier partners often do not communicate this information to us 
we often are made aware of policy cancellations at the time of annual renewal and update our membership accordingly 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the useful lives of long lived assets including property and equipment  fair value of investments  fair value of intangible assets  allowances for commission forfeitures payable to carriers  income taxes and the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation  which included estimating the value of our common stock prior to our ipo in october and our assessment whether internal use software and website development costs will result in additional functionality  among others 
we based our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize commission revenue when our commission is reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an allowance for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we use the data in the commission statements to help identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate our allowance for forfeitures payable to carriers 
we are not obligated with respect to the insurance coverage sold through our ecommerce platform 
as a result  we recognize the net amount of compensation earned as the agent in the transaction 
our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums that our members pay 
we rely on health insurance carriers to report accurately and in a timely manner the amount of commissions earned by us  and we calculate our commission revenues  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets  and direct our marketing and other operating efforts based on the reports we receive from them 
each month we analyze the reports we receive from our carriers by comparing such data to the database we maintain on our members 
it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not carriers are reporting all commissions due to us  primarily because the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier instead of by informing us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
this results in our having to identify underpayment or non payment of commissions on a policy and follow up with a carrier to obtain an explanation and or request correction of the amount of commissions paid to us 
to date  we have not had disputes of any significance with our carriers related to reported commissions 
to the extent that carriers understate or fail to timely and accurately report the amount of commissions due to us  we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled  which  if material in amount  would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
commission override revenue  which we recognize on the same basis as premium commissions  is generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenues for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override revenue to us 
certain commission amounts are subject to forfeiture in circumstances where a member has prepaid his or her premium for a future period of coverage and subsequently cancels his or her policy before the completion of 
table of contents that period 
we estimate and record an allowance for these forfeitures based on historical cancellation experience using data provided on commission statements 
the forfeitures are typically reported to us by health insurance carriers one to two months after the commission is reported and paid to us by the carrier 
our estimate of the allowance for forfeitures includes an estimate of both the reporting time lag and the forfeiture amount 
changes in our historical trends would result in changes to our estimated forfeitures in future periods 
there were no changes in our average forfeiture rates or reporting time lag during the years ended december   and  which had a material impact on our allowance for forfeitures 
in addition  we generate sponsorship revenue from carrier advertisements that appear on our website 
specifically  carriers who have purchased advertising can choose to have specific health insurance plans displayed prominently after a consumer has entered certain census information 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee  which is recognized over the period that advertising is displayed  and often a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
in instances where the performance criteria is measured based on data that is tracked by us  revenue is recognized in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria is measured based on data that is tracked by the carrier  revenue is recognized when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the carrier along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the carrier 
we also generate revenue from the licensing of our technology to third parties  such as carriers and agents 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party 
in addition  these license agreements generally include performance criteria that is either measured based on data that is tracked by us or based on data that is tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
deferred revenue consists of deferred technology licensing implementation fees as well as amounts collected from sponsorship or technology licensing customers in advance of our performing our service for such customers 
we also defer amounts that have been reported to us related to transactions where our services are complete  but where we cannot currently estimate the allowance for future forfeitures related to those amounts 
for example  at june   deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet included million related to a single health insurance carrier that  effective january  changed its basis for calculating and reporting commission amounts from a percentage of the premium it collected to a percentage of the premium it billed 
since this was the first carrier to calculate and report commission amounts on this basis  we did not have sufficient historical forfeiture experience to estimate and record an appropriate allowance for forfeitures as commission amounts were reported to us by the carrier 
accordingly  all commission amounts reported to us by the carrier since the beginning of were deferred 
during the third quarter ended september   we determined we had sufficient experience to estimate an allowance for forfeitures for this carrier  at which time all amounts previously deferred were recorded as revenue  net of an allowance for forfeitures 
internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs in accordance with the guidance set forth in statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for web site development costs 
we capitalize costs of materials  consultants and compensation and related expenses of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software  however  we usually expense as incurred website development costs for new features and functionalities because it is not probable that they will result in additional functionality until they are both developed and tested with confirmation that they are more effective than the current set of features and functionalities on our website 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter 
table of contents the states at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  which is generally three years 
to the extent that we change the manner in which we develop and test new features and functionalities related to our website  assess the ongoing value of capitalized assets or determine the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized  the amount of website development costs we capitalize and amortize in future periods would be impacted 
stock based compensation prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r on january   we accounted for stock option grants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and complied with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb  deferred stock based compensation expense is recorded for the intrinsic value of options the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the option exercise price at the grant date and is amortized ratably over the option s vesting period 
on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant  and to recognize the cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective method  which requires us to apply its provisions only to stock based awards to employees granted on or after january   and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january  in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r  we did not modify the terms of any previously granted stock options or restricted stock awards 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense totaling million and million  respectively  related to stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted to employees and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
at december   total unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted to employees under our stock plans and accounted for in accordance with sfas r was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of million 
this cost will be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining weighted average vesting term of the underlying equity awards  which was approximately years as of december  unrecognized stock based compensation will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures 
as of december   historical actual and estimated future forfeitures of our awards have been immaterial 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recorded as a cumulative catch up adjustment in the period when they occur 
we will continue to evaluate our forfeiture experience in the future 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the years ended december  and consisted of stock based compensation related to stock option and restricted stock awards granted prior to january   which was calculated in accordance with apb  and stock based compensation for all stock based awards granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r results in higher amounts of stock based compensation expense for awards granted after january  than would have been recorded if we had continued to apply the provisions of apb the grant date fair value of our stock based awards was determined using the black scholes merton pricing model and a single option award approach 
the weighted average expected term for stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  as we did not have sufficient historical option exercise behavior on which to estimate expected terms 
the simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option 
we have estimated the volatility used as an input to the model based on an analysis of our stock price since our ipo in october  as well as an analysis of similar public companies for which we have data 
we estimate our expected volatility using the weighted average of our implied volatility  our mean reversion volatility  and the mean reversion volatility of similar public companies 
table of contents for which we have data 
we have used judgment in selecting these companies  as well as evaluating the available historical and implied volatility data for these companies 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and volatility related to our own stock based awards on a prospective basis  and incorporating these factors into the model 
the accounting for and disclosure of employee and non employee equity instruments  primarily stock options  restricted common stock  restricted stock units and class a nonvoting common stock  requires judgment by management on a number of assumptions 
changes in key assumptions will significantly impact the valuation of such instruments 
because there had been no public market for our stock prior to our initial public offering in october  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon  among other things  internal valuation analyses prepared by management  which considered sales of our common stock to unrelated independent third parties 
determining the fair value of our common stock prior to our initial public offering required us to make complex and subjective judgments involving estimates of revenues  earnings  assumed market growth rates and estimated costs as well as appropriate probabilities of future events and discount rates 
these estimates were consistent with the plans and estimates that we used to manage our business 
there was inherent uncertainty in making these estimates 
the intrinsic value of outstanding vested and unvested stock options at december   was million based on the last reported price for our common stock on the nasdaq global market on december  the intrinsic value of options outstanding does not impact the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded in future periods 
future stock based compensation expense is dependent upon the fair value of each option at the date each option is granted and the number of awards issued and outstanding during each period 
we expect stock based compensation expense will increase in the future as the number of equity awards issued and outstanding increases 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as required by sfas no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under sfas  deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
since tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  which gives rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not criteria  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded  based upon recent operating results  expectations of future taxable income  available carryforward periods and other factors  that it was more likely than not that we would realize sufficient earnings to utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we partially reduced the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and recorded a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we were able to develop expectations of future taxable income and 
table of contents estimate other relevant factors sufficiently in the future to conclude that it was more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and recorded a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had no remaining valuation allowance and we will not be able to recognize any such tax benefits in the future 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rates in and differed from the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the releases of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in those years 
we expect our effective tax rate will be more in line with statutory federal and state tax rates in  however  due to the large amount of remaining net operating loss credit carryforwards  we expect to pay federal and state taxes at or below the alternative minimum tax rate  which is approximately  on a cash basis in future changes in various factors  such as the amount of stock based compensation we record during the year  potential limitations on the use of our federal and state net operating loss credit carryforwards  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from research and development credits and state and foreign taxes  would impact our estimates  and as a result  could affect our effective tax rate and the amount of income tax expense we record  and pay  in future periods 
our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards were available without annual limitations as of december  for tax return purposes  we had net operating loss carryforwards at december  of approximately million and million for us federal income tax and state income tax purposes  respectively 
included in these amounts are unrealized federal and state net operating loss deductions resulting from stock option exercises of approximately million and million  respectively 
federal and state net operating loss deductions resulting from stock option exercises are not included in the deferred income tax table in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the benefit of these future net operating loss deductions  when realized  will be recognized as a credit to additional paid in capital 
under sfas r  we consider stock option deduction benefits in excess of book compensation charges realized when we obtain an incremental benefit determined by the with and without calculation method 
under the with and without approach  excess tax benefits related to share based payments are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
for example  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from prior years are used to reduce taxes currently payable prior to deductions from stock option exercises for purposes of financial reporting  while for tax return purposes  current year stock compensation deductions are generally used before net operating loss carryforwards 
indirect effects of excess tax benefits  such as the effect on research and development tax credits  are not considered 
in accordance with sfas r  only realized excess tax benefits are reflected in the financial statements 
excess tax benefits are classified in the statements of cash flows as a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas step one  recognition  requires a company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
step two  measurement  is based on the largest amount of benefit  which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement 
we recognized no cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of fin on january   because our uncertain tax positions on that date million had a full valuation allowance recorded against them 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
we have elected to record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with fin

table of contents we recorded a provision for income taxes in attributable to federal alternative minimum taxes currently payable due to limits on the amount of net operating losses that may be applied against taxable income earned in under current tax regulations

liquidity and capital resources the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million 
cash equivalents are comprised primarily of highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of days or less from the date of purchase and marketable securities are comprised primarily of highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of more than days to less than two years from the date of purchase 
marketable securities that are available for use in current operations are classified as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets regardless of the remaining time to maturity 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income loss  adjusted for certain non cash items including deferred income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities

these items were partially offset by a net loss of million 

table of contents the timing of the recognition of our commission revenue depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission reports and associated commission payments from health insurance carriers 
if we were to experience a delay in receiving a commission payment from a health insurance carrier at the end of a quarter  our operating cash flows for that quarter could be negatively impacted 
additionally  commission override payments are reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
for example  a carrier may make a commission override payment to us on an annual basis  which would positively impact our cash flows in the quarter the payment is received 
the majority of our annual commission override payments are typically received during the first quarter of the year 
historically  we have experienced a reduction in operating cash flows during the first quarter of the year due to the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees 
in addition  a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our ecommerce platform 
since our marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and the revenue from approved applications is recognized as commissions are subsequently reported to us  our operating cash flows could be negatively impacted by a substantial increase in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter

future needs we believe that cash generated from operations and our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital
