item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in the risk factors 
overview general we are a leading supplier of semiconductor based  high performance interconnect products that facilitate data transmission between servers  communications infrastructure equipment and storage systems 
our products are an integral part of a total solution focused on computing  storage and communication applications used in enterprise data center  high performance computing and embedded systems 
we operate in one reportable segment the development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of interconnect semiconductor products see note segment information  of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are a fabless semiconductor company that provides high performance interconnect products based on semiconductor integrated circuits  or ics 
we design  develop and market adapter and switch ics  both of which are silicon devices that provide high performance connectivity 
we also offer adapter cards that incorporate our ics 
growth in our target markets is being driven by the need to improve the efficiency and performance of clustered systems in data centers  as well as the need to significantly reduce the total cost of ownership 
we outsource our manufacturing  assembly  packaging and production test functions  which enables us to focus on the design  development  sales and marketing of our products 
as a result  our business has relatively low capital requirements 
however  our ability to bring new products to market  fulfill customer orders and achieve long term growth depends on our ability to maintain sufficient technical personnel and obtain sufficient external subcontractor capacity 
we have experienced rapid growth in our total revenues in each of the last three years 
our revenues increased from million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in order to continue to increase our revenues  we must continue to achieve design wins over other infiniband and ethernet providers and providers of competing interconnect technologies 
we consider a design win to occur when an oem or contract manufacturer notifies us that it has selected our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development 
because the life cycles for our customers products can last for several years if these products have successful commercial introductions  we expect to continue to generate revenues over an extended period of time for each successful design win 
it is difficult for us to forecast the demand for our products  in part because of the highly complex supply chain between us and the end user markets that incorporate our products 
demand for new features changes rapidly 
due to our lengthy product development cycle  it is critical for us to anticipate changes in demand for our various product features and the applications they serve to allow sufficient time for product design 
our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers 
conversely  our failure to forecast declining demand or shifts in product mix can result in excess or obsolete inventory 

table of contents revenues 
we derive revenues from sales of our ics and hca cards 
to date  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers 
total sales to customers representing more than of revenues accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of our principal customers or the reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by one of these customers could cause our revenues to decline materially if we are unable to increase our revenues from other customers 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of silicon wafers purchased from our foundry supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  costs associated with the assembly  packaging and production testing of our products by advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  outside processing costs associated with the manufacture of our hca cards by flextronics  royalties due to third parties  including the office of the chief scientist of israel s ministry of industry  trade and labor  or the ocs  the binational industrial research and development foundation  or bird  and a third party licensor  warranty costs  excess and obsolete inventory costs and costs of personnel associated with production management and quality assurance 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from our foundries  we also have the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into semiconductor devices 
manufacturing yield is the percentage of acceptable product resulting from the manufacturing process  as identified when the product is tested as a finished ic 
if our manufacturing yields decrease  our cost per unit increases  which could have a significant adverse impact on our cost of revenues 
we do not have long term pricing agreements with tsmc and ase 
accordingly  our costs are subject to price fluctuations based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we estimate that lead times for delivery of our finished semiconductors from our foundry supplier and assembly  packaging and production testing subcontractor are approximately three to four months and that lead times for delivery from our hca card manufacturing subcontractors are approximately eight to ten weeks 
we build inventory based on forecasts of customer orders rather than the actual orders themselves 
in addition  as customers are increasingly seeking opportunities to reduce their lead times  we may be required to increase our inventory to meet customer demand 
we expect our cost of revenues to increase over time as a result of the expected increase in our sales volume 
generally  our cost of revenues as a percentage of sales revenues has decreased over time  primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions  economies of scale related to higher unit volumes and our decision to discontinue sales of our lower margin switch systems products in this trend may not continue in the future  and will depend on overall customer demand for our products  our product mix  competitive product offerings and related pricing and our ability to reduce manufacturing costs 
operational expenses research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in research and development  costs associated with computer aided design software tools  depreciation expense and tape out costs 
tape out costs are expenses related to the manufacture of new products  including charges for mask sets  prototype wafers  mask set revisions and testing incurred before releasing new products 
we anticipate these expenses will increase in future periods based on an increase in personnel to support our product development activities and the introduction of new products 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our product tape outs 
we received grants from the ocs for several projects 
under the terms of these grants  if products developed from an ocs funded project generate revenue we are required to pay a royalty of of the net sales as soon as we begin to sell such products until of the dollar value of the grant plus interest at libor is repaid 
all of the grants we have received from the ocs have resulted in ic products sold by us 
in  we received an aggregate of  of approved grants in support of some of our research and development programs 
we received no grants from the ocs during the years ended december  and in total  we have received grants from ocs in amount of million 
as of december   our contingent obligation in respect of royalties payable to the ocs totaled approximately  payable out of future net sales  if any  of products that were developed under projects funded by the ocs 
the continued repayment of ocs grants is contingent on future sales of products 
table of contents developed with the support of such grants  and we have no obligation to refund these grants if future sales are not generated 
all reported research and development expenses are net of ocs and other government grants 
the terms of ocs grants generally prohibit the manufacture of products developed with ocs funding outside of israel without the prior consent of the ocs 
the ocs has approved the manufacture outside of israel of our ic products  subject to an undertaking by us to pay the ocs royalties on the sales of our ocs supported products until such time as the total royalties paid equal of the amount of ocs grants 
under applicable israeli law  ocs consent is also required to transfer technologies developed with ocs funding to third parties in israel 
transfer of ocs funded technologies outside of israel is permitted with the approval of the ocs and in accordance with the restrictions and payment obligations set forth under israeli law 
israeli law further specifies that both the transfer of know how as well as the transfer of intellectual property rights in such know how are subject to the same restrictions 
these restrictions do not apply to exports of products from israel or the sale of products developed with these technologies 
we do not anticipate the need to transfer any of our intellectual property rights outside of israel at this time 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in sales  marketing and customer support  commission payments to external  third party sales representatives and charges for trade shows  promotions and travel 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in sales and marketing personnel and increased commission payments on higher sales volumes 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in finance  human resources and administrative activities and charges for accounting and corporate legal fees 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in personnel to meet the requirements associated with our anticipated growth and being a public company 
taxes on income our operations in israel have been granted approved enterprise status by the investment center of the israeli ministry of industry  trade and labor  which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  under the terms of the approved enterprise program  income that is attributable to our operations in yokneam  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of ten years commencing when we first generate taxable income after setting off our losses from prior years 
income that is attributable to our operations in tel aviv  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of two years commencing when we first generate taxable income after setting off our losses from prior years  and will be subject to a reduced income tax rate generally  depending on the percentage of foreign investment in our company for the following five to eight years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  warranty provision  income taxes and share based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we account for our revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenues from sales of products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement with our customers typically includes freight on board shipping point  day payment terms  no right of return and no customer acceptance provisions 
we generally rely upon a purchase order as persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we determine whether collectibility is probable on a customer by customer basis 
when assessing the probability of collection  we consider the number of years the customer has been in business and the history of our collections 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  no product is shipped and no revenue is recognized unless cash is received in advance 
for multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on fair value 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  the company defers the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
if the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  no revenue is recognized 
the amount and impact on our consolidated financial statements of undelivered elements have historically been insignificant 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts 
if we determine that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  we provide a specific allowance for credit losses to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis and our historical experience with each customer 
customers are subject to an ongoing credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions 
we review and update our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
our bad debt expense totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on net realizable value 
cost is determined for raw materials on a first in  first out basis  for work in process based on actual costs and for finished goods based on standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasted demand generally over a nine month period and market conditions 
inventory reserves are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until it is either sold or scrapped 
warranty provision we provide a limited warranty for periods of up to three years from the date of delivery against defects in materials and workmanship 
if a customer has a defective product  we will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge 
we record estimated warranty expenses at the time we recognize the associated product revenues based on our historical rates of return and costs of repair over the preceding month period 
in addition  we recognize estimated warranty expenses for specific defects at the time those defects are identified 
share based compensation through december   we elected to account for share based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations rather than adopting the fair value method provided under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for share based compensation 
table of contents sfas 
we have generally not recognized any compensation expense for share options we granted to our employees where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires that we measure compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee share options  based on estimated fair values and recognize that expense over the required service period 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method 
under this method  sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  compensation cost previously recorded under apb for unvested options will continue to be recognized as the required services are rendered 
accordingly  for the year ended december   share based compensation expense includes compensation costs related to estimated fair values of awards granted after the date of adoption of sfas r and compensation costs related to unvested awards at the date of adoption based on the intrinsic values as previously recorded under apb for options granted after january   and valued in accordance with sfas r  we use the straight line method for expense attribution 
for options granted prior to january   we use the multiple grant approach for expense attribution  which results in substantially higher amounts of amortization in earlier years as opposed to the straight line method  which results in equal amortization over the vesting period of the options 
upon adoption of sfas r  we were required to estimate the number of outstanding options that are not expected to vest 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates  we will revise our estimates 
no compensation cost is recognized for options that do not vest 
under the multiple grant approach  forfeitures of unvested options resulting from employee terminations result in the reversal during the period in which the termination occurred of previously expensed share compensation associated with the unvested options with maturities similar to the expected terms of the respective options 
share compensation from vested options  whether forfeited or not  is not reversed 
we estimated the fair value of options granted after january  using the black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation 
these variables and assumptions include the weighted average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding  the volatility of our ordinary shares  the risk free interest rate and the estimated rate of forfeitures of unvested share options 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will record the difference as a cumulative adjustment in the period we revise our estimates 
because our ordinary shares were not publicly traded until february   we used the simplified calculation of expected life described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and we estimated our ordinary shares volatility based on an average of the historical volatilities of the company s peer group in the industry in which it does business 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected terms of the respective options 
we estimated expected forfeitures based on our historical experience 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on the provisions of enacted tax law  the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb financial accounting standards interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is 
table of contents to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
upon implementation of fin  the company recognized no material adjustment to the january  balance of retained earnings 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately  results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net benefit from provision for taxes on income net income comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
this increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased unit sales of approximately  offset by a decrease in average selling prices of 
the increase in unit sales was driven by broader adoption of infiniband and our products and resulted primarily from increased purchases by hewlett packard  voltaire and cisco  which accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december  and increased purchases by network appliance  super micro computer and sun microsystems  which each accounted for less than of our revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in average sales prices was primarily attributed to the decline in average sales price of ic s 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin increased to in the year ended december  from approximately in the year ended december  this increase in gross margin was primarily due to a reduction in production costs associated with outsourced labor  raw materials and volume discounts 
in addition  part of the gross margin improvement was due to increased sales of next generation double data rate ddr products for which we receive higher margins 
revenues attributable to ddr products were and of total revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher salary related expenses of approximately million associated with increased headcount  increased share based compensation of approximately million primarily due to new option grants  an increase in new product expenses of approximately million primarily due to tape out costs  increased depreciation and amortization of equipment  software and intellectual property of approximately  arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote resources to develop new products  meet the changing requirements of our customers  expand into new markets and technologies  and hire additional personnel 
for a further discussion of share based compensation included in research and development expense  see share based compensation expense below 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher salary related expenses of approximately million associated with increased headcount  increased external sales commission expenses of approximately million due to increase in sales  increased share based compensation of approximately  primarily due to new option grants and an increase in tradeshow and advertising expenses of approximately  related to expanding our sales and marketing activities as we broadened our customer and product base 
for a further discussion of share based compensation included in sales and marketing expense  see share based compensation expense below 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily due to higher salary related expenses of approximately  associated with increased headcount  increased legal  accounting and other professional fee expenses of approximately  as a result of the company becoming public and increased share based compensation expense of approximately  primarily due to new option grants 
share based compensation expense 
the following table presents details of total share based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income year ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative the amount of unearned share based compensation currently estimated to be expensed from through related to unvested share based payment awards at december  is million 
of this amount  million  million  million and million are currently estimated to be recorded in   and  respectively 
the weighted average period over which the unearned share based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
the increase in unearned share based compensation of million at december  from the million balance at december  was primarily the result of share based awards granted during including the grant of employee stock options to new employees  merit grants to existing employees and the accumulation of rights to purchase shares of our ordinary shares by employees participating in our employee stock purchase program  offset in part by share based compensation of million expensed during if there are any 
table of contents modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
other income  net 
other income  net consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income  net was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income resulting from investments of the net proceeds of our initial public offering completed in the first quarter of benefit from provision for taxes on income 
benefit from taxes on income was million for the year ended december  compared to a provision for taxes of  for the year ended december  the change consists of the benefit from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets of million primarily related to net operating losses in israel expected to be utilized in before the approved enterprise tax holiday begins  which was offset by a provision for income taxes of million related to interest income from investments of proceeds from our initial public offering and higher income attributable to mellanox technologies  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
in accordance with sfas  we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
management believes that historical profitability combined with the expectation of future profitability supports the future realization of certain deferred tax assets and accordingly  released valuation allowance for certain foreign deferred tax assets in the year comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
this increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased unit sales of approximately  driven by broader adoption of infiniband and our products  offset by a decrease in average sales prices of 
a portion of the decrease in average sales prices was due to the decline from to in the percentage of revenues attributable to switch systems  which have significantly higher sales prices 
in addition  cisco  one of our largest customers that represented approximately of our revenues in the year ended december   and approximately of our revenues in the year ended december  a portion of this percentage decline was attributable to an accumulation of inventory in by cisco following its acquisition of topspin communications 
we believe this inventory was substantially sold in and cisco remained one of our largest customers for the year ended december  gross profit and margin 
gross profit was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximate million for the year ended december   representing an increase of

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the recent decline in the market value of certain securities backed by residential mortgage loans has led to a large liquidity crisis effecting the broader us housing market  the financial services industry and global financial markets 
investors in many industry sectors have experienced substantial decreases in asset valuations and uncertain market liquidity 
furthermore  credit rating authorities have  in many cases  been slow to respond to the rapid changes in the underlying value of certain securities and pervasive market illiquidity  regarding these securities 
as a result  this credit crisis may have a potential impact on the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or may result in impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline which is determined to be other than temporary 
we do not currently believe that the impact of this credit crisis on the value of our marketable securities would be material or warrant a determination of an other than temporary write down 
interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits and interest bearing investments in marketable securities with maturities of one year or less  consisting of commercial paper  government and non government debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are invoiced in us dollars 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency 
however  a significant portion of our headcount related expenses  consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  and facilities and maintenance expenses are denominated in new israeli shekels  or nis 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the nis 
furthermore  we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in nis 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the nis  we will experience a negative impact on our profit margins 
to manage this risk  we have on occasion converted us dollars into nis within two to three weeks of monthly pay dates in israel to lock in the related salary expense given the different currencies 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities but we may choose to do so in the future 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in israel 
at december   approximately million of our monthly operating expenses were denominated in nis 
this amount may increase in the future due to hiring additional employees in israel and expanding our facilities there 
inflation related risk we believe that the rate of inflation in israel has not had a material impact on our business to date 
our cost in israel in us dollar terms will increase if inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in israel
