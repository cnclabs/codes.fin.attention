item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of about us that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document are forward looking statements 
although we believe that in making such statements our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected 
statements that are predictive in nature  that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  or that include words such as will  would  should  plans  likely  expects  anticipates  intends  believes  estimates  thinks  may  and similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the following important factors  in addition to those discussed under risk factors under part i  item  could affect the future results of the health care industry in general  and us in particular  and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
uncertainties in our establishing or maintaining relationships with physicians and hospitals  the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations  uncertainties inherent in third party payors attempts to limit health care coverages and levels of reimbursement  the effects of competition and technological changes  the availability or lack thereof of acquisition or combination opportunities  and general economic  market or business conditions 
general we provide healthcare services and manufacture medical devices  primarily for the urology community 
prior to july   we also designed and manufactured trailers and coaches that transport high technology medical devices and equipment for mobile command and control centers and the media and broadcast industry 
urology services 
our lithotripsy services are provided principally through limited partnerships or other entities that we manage  which use lithotripsy devices 
in  physicians who are affiliated with us used our lithotripters to perform approximately  procedures in the us we do not render any medical services 
rather  the physicians do 
we have two types of contracts  retail and wholesale  that we enter into in providing our lithotripsy services 
retail contracts are contracts where we contract with the hospital and private insurance payors 
wholesale contracts are contracts where we contract only with the hospital 
the two approaches functionally differ in that  under a retail contract  we generally bill for the entire non physician fee for all patients other than governmental pay patients  for which the hospital bills the non physician fee 
under a wholesale contract  the hospital generally bills for the entire non physician fee for all patients 
in both cases  the billing party contractually bears the costs associated with the billing service  including pre certification  as well as non collection 
the non billing party is generally entitled to its fees regardless of whether the billing party actually collects the non physician fee 
accordingly  under the wholesale contracts where we are the non billing party  the hospital generally receives a greater proportion of the total non physician fee to compensate for its billing costs and collection risk 
conversely  under the retail contracts where we generally provide the billing services and bear the collection risk  we receive a greater proportion of the total non physician fee 
although the non physician fee under both retail and wholesale contracts varies widely based on geographical markets and the identity of the third party payor  we estimate that nationally  on average  our share of the non physician fee was roughly  for both and at this time  we do not anticipate a material shift between our retail and wholesale arrangements 
as the general partner of the limited partnerships  we also provide services relating to operating our lithotripters  including scheduling  staffing  training  quality assurance  regulatory compliance  and contracting with payors  hospitals and surgery centers 
also in the urology segment  we provide treatments for benign and cancerous conditions of the prostate 
in treating benign prostate disease  we deploy three technologies trans urethral microwave therapy tumt  photo selective vaporization of the prostate pvp  and trans urethral needle ablation tuna 
all three technologies apply an energy source which reduces the size of the prostate gland 
in september  we completed the sale of our rocky mountain prostate business  which represented almost our entire tumt treatment operations 
for treating prostate and other cancers  prior to november   we used a procedure called cryosurgery  a process which uses a double freeze thaw cycle to destroy cancer cells 
we recognize urology revenue primarily from the following sources fees for urology services 
a substantial majority of our urology revenue is derived from fees related to lithotripsy treatments performed using our lithotripters 
we  through our partnerships or other entities  facilitate the use of our equipment and provide other support services in connection with these treatments at hospitals and other health care facilities 
for a further discussion on our partnerships  see urology and government regulation and supervision in part i 
the professional fee payable to the physician performing the procedure is generally billed and collected by the physician 
benign prostate disease and prostate cancer treatment services are billed in the same manner as our lithotripsy services under either retail or wholesale contracts 
these services are also primarily performed through limited partnerships  which we manage 
fees for operating our lithotripters 
through our partnerships and otherwise directly by us  we provide services related to operating our lithotripters and receive a management fee for performing these services 
medical products 
we manufacture  sell and maintain lithotripters and their related consumables 
we also manufacture  sell and maintain intra operative x ray imaging systems and other mobile patient management tables  and are the exclusive us distributor of the revolix branded laser 
the operations of our claripath pathology laboratory are also included in our medical products segment at this time 
we recognize medical products revenue from the following sources fees for maintenance services 
we provide equipment maintenance services to our partnerships as well as outside parties 
these services are billed either on a time and material basis or at a fixed monthly contractual rate 
fees for equipment sales  consumable sales and licensing applications 
we manufacture  sell and maintain lithotripters and certain medical tables  we distribute the revolix laser and we also manufacture and sell consumables related to the lithotripters 
with respect to some lithotripter sales  in addition to the original sales price  we receive a licensing fee from the buyer of the lithotripter for each patient treated with such lithotripter 
in exchange for this licensing fee  we provide the buyer of the lithotripter with certain consumables 
all the sales for equipment and consumables are recognized when the related items are delivered 
revenues from licensing fees are recorded when the patient is treated 
in some cases  we lease certain equipment to our partnerships as well as third parties 
revenues from these leases are recognized on a monthly basis or as procedures are performed 
fees for claripath anatomical pathology services 
we provide anatomical pathology services primarily to the urology marketplace 
revenues from these services are recorded when the related laboratory procedures are performed 
recent developments effective april   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of keystone abg  inc  which owns a general partner interest in keystone mobile partners  lp the partnership  and an approximate limited partner interest in the partnership from the owners thereof  for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus certain additional cash consideration to be paid depending on the number of limited partner units sold by us in a post closing offering of such units  plus an earnout 
in august  we completed our post closing offering of the limited partner units and paid an additional  on august   sam b 
humphries  our president and chief executive officer  died as a result of complications from a may  cardiac event 
mr 
humphries had been on medical leave since may  on august   our board of directors appointed james s 
b 
whittenburg as our president and chief executive officer and as a member of our board of directors 
mr 
whittenburg had been serving as acting president and chief executive officer since late may  prior to that appointment  mr 
whittenburg served as president urology services 
on september   we completed the sale of our rocky mountain prostate business 
as a result of this sale we received proceeds totaling million in cash and recognized a gain of  accordingly  all activities related to our rocky mountain prostate business have been included in discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets are both a critical accounting policy and estimate that require judgment and are based on assumptions of future operations 
we are required to test for impairments at least annually or if circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we test for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter 
we now have two reporting units  urology services and medical products 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
because we have recognized goodwill based solely on our controlling interest  the fair value of each reporting unit also relates only to our controlling interest 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
both the income approach and the market approach require significant assumptions to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the income approach include estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  operating plans  industry data and other relevant factors 
the significant assumptions utilized in the market approach include the determination of appropriate market comparables  the estimated multiples of revenue  ebit and ebitda a willing buyer is likely to pay  and the estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
for a discussion of our and goodwill impairments and the specific assumptions used in the income and market approaches in the and analyses  see footnote c to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
a second critical accounting policy and estimate which requires judgment of management is the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
we have based our estimates on historical collection amounts  current contracts with payors  current changes of the facts and circumstances relating to these matters and certain negotiations with related payors 
a third critical accounting policy is consolidation of our investment in partnerships or limited liability companies llcs where we  as the general partner or managing member  exercise effective control  even though our ownership is less than 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  and entities more than owned and limited partnerships or llcs where we  as the general partner or managing member  exercise effective control  even though our ownership is less than 
the related agreements provide us with broad powers 
the other parties do not participate in the management of the entity and do not have the substantial ability to remove us 
investment in entities in which our investment is less than ownership and we do not have significant control are accounted for by the equity method if ownership is between  or by the cost method if ownership is less than 
we have reviewed each of the underlying agreements and determined we have effective control  however  if it was determined this control did not exist  these investments would be reflected on the equity method of accounting 
although this would change individual line items within our consolidated financial statements  it would have no effect on our net income and or total stockholders equity 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our total revenues decreased  as compared to revenues from our urology services decreased  as compared to revenues from our lithotripsy business decreased  in as compared to  while revenues from our prostate business increased  in as compared to the actual number of lithotripsy procedures performed in decreased by compared to  primarily due to partnership and mobile route closures in late and continued weak performance across our western region partnerships in early the average rate per procedure increased by in as compared to revenues for our medical products segment decreased by  compared to primarily due to less sales of our lithotripters and the discontinuation of sales of certain tables in early medical products revenues before intersegment eliminations totaled million for and million for we sold lithotripters and tables in compared to lithotripters and tables in revenues from our service operations and consumable sales decreased  in as compared to this decrease relates primarily to lower electrode sales especially as related to our foreign operations which we closed in revenues from our new laboratory which commenced operations in january  totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our costs of services and general and administrative expenses for decreased  compared to our cost of services associated with our urology services operations increased  in as compared with the cause of this increase relates primarily to increased rental expenses paid on revolix units leased from our medical products division of  and a decrease in gains resulting from sales of various partnership interests in as compared to of  which are recorded against operating expenses 
this was partially offset by lower laser supply costs of  which corresponds to more partnerships utilizing the revolix laser as compared to the greenlight laser 
our cost of services associated with our medical products operations for decreased  compared to the primary cause of this decrease relates to significant decreases in external sales of lithotripters and tables in  a cost reduction recorded as a result of the receipt of lease payments from our urology services division on revolix units noted above  partially offset by approximately  in increased expenses at our new lab 
a significant portion of medical products costs relate to providing maintenance services to our urology services segment and are allocated to the urology services segment 
in the future we expect margins in medical products to continue to vary significantly from period to period based on the mix of intercompany and third party sales 
our selling  general and administrative costs decreased  in as compared to this is primarily attributable to approximately  in costs paid to strategic consultants  million in severance payments   in higher share based compensation costs which were incurred in compared to  as well as approximately  in decreased personnel  insurance  marketing  recruiting and other costs 
in addition we received approximately  as a result of our former swiss manufacturing subsidiary s insolvency proceedings in  which was recorded against selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test  we recorded an impairment to our urology services segment goodwill totaling million 
this impairment was due to a decrease in our estimated future discounted cash flows for this segment 
this decrease was primarily caused by lower projected growth rates for our laser operations as well as the timing of certain future growth for our igrt operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment to our goodwill totaling million related to our urology services segment and million related to our medical products segment 
the impairment to our urology services segment was due primarily to a decrease in the number of overall procedures during  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with the loss of certain partnerships and contracts late in to competitors 
the impairment in our medical products segment relates primarily to our decision to reduce or exit certain product lines  specifically patient management tables and orthopedic consumables during the fourth quarter of along with the closing of our european operations 
income from discontinued operations in decreased  compared to income from discontinued operations in included  attributable to our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment and  in losses attributable to our hifu  cryosurgery  and rocky mountain thermotherapy rmpt operations 
we recognized a gain  net of tax  totaling million in from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment 
in  we had a loss from discontinued operations of  attributable to our rmpt and hifu operations 
this loss included a gain of  from the sale of our rmpt business  which closed september  depreciation and amortization expense decreased  in compared to minority interest in consolidated income for increased  compared to  as a result of increases in minority interest percentages at certain partnerships 
provision for income taxes in increased  compared to due to lower taxable loss in than year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our total revenues decreased  as compared to revenues from our urology services segment decreased  as compared to revenues from our lithotripsy business decreased  in as compared to  while revenues from our prostate business decreased  in as compared to the actual number of lithotripsy procedures performed in decreased by compared to  primarily due to weak performance across our western region partnerships and the loss of certain partnerships and contracts in late the average rate per procedure increased by in as compared to revenues for our medical products segment increased by  compared to primarily due to a mix of sales between external customers and sales to our urology services segment 
medical products revenues before intersegment eliminations totaled million for and million for we sold lithotripters and tables in compared to lithotripters and tables in revenues from our service operations and consumable sales decreased  in as compared to revenues from our new lab which started operations in january  totaled  for the year ended december  our costs of services and general and administrative expenses for increased  compared to our cost of services associated with our urology services operations increased  in as compared with the primary cause of this increase relates to increased salaries and benefits costs of  related to annual merit increases  increased rental expenses paid to our medical products segment on revolix units of approximately  and an increase in expenses related to a new entity of approximately  in this was partially offset by an increase in capital gains of  resulting from sales of various partnership interests  which is recorded against divisional expenses and decreases in laser supply costs of  which corresponds to our shift from the greenlight laser to the revolix laser 
our cost of services associated with our medical products operations for increased  compared to the primary causes of this increase relate to approximately million in increased costs of goods sold related to increased sales to outside customers as well as certain inventory write downs due to discontinued product lines in late  million in increased costs at our new lab  increases in salaries and benefits expenses of  primarily related to increased head count in our sales force  increased legal expenses of  and increased expenses of  related to increased insurance  consulting and professional fees and bad debt expense 
a significant portion of medical products costs relate to providing maintenance services to our urology services segment and are allocated to the urology segment 
in the future we expect margins in medical products to vary significantly from period to period based on the mix of intercompany and third party sales 
our selling  general and administrative costs increased  in as compared to this is primarily attributable to increases in in salaries and benefit expenses of  primarily related to increases in our marketing head count  costs related to severance payments of approximately million  million in new costs related to share based compensation expense  and million paid to strategic consultants in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment to our goodwill totaling million related to our urology services segment and million related to our medical products segment 
the impairment to our urology services segment was due primarily to a decrease in the number of overall procedures during  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with the loss of certain partnerships and contracts late in to competitors 
the impairment in our medical products segment relates primarily to our decision to reduce or exit certain product lines  specifically patient management tables and orthopedic consumables during the fourth quarter of along with the closing of our european operations 
on june   we entered into an agreement to sell our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment 
accordingly  in we have classified this segment as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the sale was completed on july  as a result of the sale we realized a gain of million  which is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
this gain utilized approximately million of our deferred tax assets 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  in compared to minority interest in consolidated income for decreased  compared to  as a result of a decrease in income from our urology services segment due primarily to lower revenues noted above 
provision for income taxes in decreased  compared to due to a decrease in taxable income  primarily related to our goodwill impairment recorded in our effective tax rate significantly increased in as compared to  since approximately half of our goodwill impairment was not deductible for tax purposes 
outlook as discussed above under recent developments  the urology services segment experienced a decrease in overall lithotripsy procedures during as compared to  primarily across our western region partnerships  combined with loss of certain partnerships and contracts in the fourth quarter of in addition  we exited or reduced sales efforts in certain product lines in the medical products segment in the fourth quarter of the numbers of procedures performed have remained relatively stable over the third and fourth quarters of we intend to increase our urology services operations primarily through forming new operating partnerships in new markets as well as by acquisitions 
we intend to grow our medical products operations by offering new equipment and expanding our customer base 
as of the date of filing this annual report on form k  we anticipate that the levels of revenues and income from continuing operations exclusive of goodwill impairments for will be materially consistent with the reported financial results for  but we cannot provide assurances that the results will be materially consistent with our results 
see forward looking statements under this item and risk factors under part i  item liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash and cash equivalents were  and  at december  and  respectively 
our subsidiaries generally distribute all of their available cash quarterly  after establishing reserves for estimated capital expenditures and working capital 
for the years ended december  and  our subsidiaries distributed cash of approximately  and  respectively  to minority interest holders 
cash provided by our operations  after minority interest  was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  from to  fee and other revenue collected decreased by  due primarily to decreased revenues 
cash paid to employees  suppliers of goods and others decreased by  in this fluctuation is attributable to the significant payoff of accrued expenses in partially offset by a decrease in our overall expenses 
cash used by our investing activities for the year ended december   was  we used approximately million in cash to acquire our interests in the new keystone partnership and we used million to acquire increased ownership in two other partnerships 
we purchased equipment and leasehold improvements totaling  in cash used by our investing activities for the year ended december   was  primarily due to cash from discontinued operations which was  and represents the sales proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment  partially offset by  in equipment and leasehold improvements purchases 
cash used in our financing activities for the year ended december   was  primarily due to distributions to minority interests of  and payments on notes payable of  partially offset by borrowings on notes payable of  cash used in our financing activities for the year ended december   was  primarily due to distributions to minority interests of  and net payments on notes payable of  which included repayment in full of our term loan b 
we also received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in accounts receivable as of december  has decreased  from december  this decrease relates primarily to lower revenues as well as to the timing of collections 
inventory as of december  totaled  and decreased  from december  senior credit facility our senior credit facility is comprised of a five year million revolver and a million senior secured term loan b due we entered into this senior credit facility in march the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor to or prime 
to 
on july   we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our specialty vehicle manufacturing segment to repay the term loan b in full 
as of december   there were no amounts drawn on the revolver 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  create liens  make investments  sell assets  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  make restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and make acquisitions 
in addition  our facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our senior credit facility as of december  notes in april  our million term loan b referred to above was funded and we used the proceeds to redeem the million of unsecured senior subordinated notes 
the notes were subject to an rate of interest and interest was payable semi annually on april st and october st 
other other long term debt 
as of december   we had notes totaling million related to equipment purchased by our limited partnerships 
these notes are paid from the cash flows of the related partnerships 
they bear interest at libor or prime plus a certain premium and are due over the next three years 
other long term obligations 
at december   we had an obligation totaling  related to payments to the previous owner of aluminum body corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours that we sold as part of the sale of our specialty vehicles manufacturing segment abc  for  per quarter until march  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement 
also at december   as part of our acquisition of medstone international inc in february  we had an obligation totaling  related to payments to an employee for  a month continuing until february  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement 
we have an obligation totaling  related to payments of  a month until june  as consideration for a noncompetition agreement with a previous employee of our medical products division 
unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
the resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that will be required to settle these matters 
in addition  certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of credit and operating loss carryforwards as well as other offsets  including the indirect benefit from other taxing jurisdictions that may be available 
general the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt    operating leases     non compete contracts unrecognized tax benefit   total      represents long term debt as discussed above 
represents operating leases in the ordinary course of our business 
represents an obligation of due to the previous owner of one of our subsidiaries  at a rate of per quarter until march  an obligation of due to an employee of medstone  at a rate of per month continuing until february   and an obligation of due to a previous employee of ours  at a rate of per month until june represents unrecognized tax benefits as discussed above 
in addition  the scheduled principal repayments for all long term debt as of december  are payable as follows in thousands thereafter total  our primary sources of cash are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our cash flows from operations and therefore our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors discussed under risk factors under part i 
likewise  our ability to borrow under our senior credit facility will depend on these factors  which will affect our ability to comply with the covenants in our facility and our ability to obtain waivers for  or otherwise address  any noncompliance with the terms of our facility with our lenders 
we intend to increase our urology services operations primarily through forming new operating subsidiaries in new markets as well as by acquisitions 
we seek opportunities to grow our medical products operations by offering new equipment and expanding our customer base 
we intend to fund the purchase price for future acquisitions and developments using borrowings under our senior credit facility and cash flows from our operations 
in addition  we may use shares of our common stock in such acquisitions where we deem appropriate 
based upon the current level of our operations and anticipated cost savings and revenue growth  we believe that cash flows from our operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our senior credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs both for the short term and for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  that we will realize our anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements or that future borrowings will be available under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
inflation our operations are not significantly affected by inflation because we are not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of our expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact of adopting sfas r will be dependent on the future business combinations that we may pursue after its effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
this statement amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas requires companies to report a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary as equity 
additionally  companies are required to include amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest in the consolidated net income and provide disclosure of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
this statement clarifies that after control is obtained  transactions which change ownership but do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions 
prior to this statement being issued  decreases in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary could be accounted for as equity transactions or as transactions with gain or loss recognition in the income statement 
a change in ownership of a consolidated subsidiary that results in a loss of control and deconsolidation would result in a gain or loss in net income 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  with earlier adoption prohibited 
the adoption of sfas will revise our presentation of consolidated financial statements and further impact will be dependent on our future changes in ownership in subsidiaries after the effective date 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting to many financial instruments and certain other items 
the fair value option is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  based on our current operations  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in december  the fasb released a proposed fasb staff position fsp fas b effective date of fasb statement no 
which  if adopted as proposed  would delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
based on our current operations  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we had long term debt including current portion totaling  of which  had fixed rates of to  and  incurred interest at a variable rate equal to a specified prime rate 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the remaining floating interest rate debt totaling  we make monthly or quarterly payments of principal and interest on  of the floating rate debt 
an increase in interest rates of would result in a  annual increase in interest expense on this existing principal balance
