overview anadys pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patient care by developing novel medicines in the areas of hepatitis c and oncology 
we are developing ana  a small molecule  non nucleoside inhibitor of the nsb polymerase for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv infection and ana  an oral toll like receptor tlr agonist prodrug for cancer 
on june   we announced that we nominated ana as a candidate for clinical development as an orally administered direct antiviral for the treatment of chronic hcv infection 
we plan to file an investigational new drug ind application for ana during the second quarter of  and subject to food and drug administration fda allowance  initiate a phase clinical trial of ana in the second quarter of we filed an ind application for ana in the third quarter of and have received clearance from the fda to proceed with a phase clinical trial in cancer patients 
we are currently conducting a phase i clinical trial of ana in the united states 
on july   we announced that we and our collaborator novartis had decided to discontinue the development of ana for the treatment of hcv infection 
following this decision  on august   we announced that we were effecting a strategic restructuring to focus our resources on the development of ana and ana as part of this restructuring  we discontinued further development of ana  a nucleotide analog we had been jointly developing with lg life sciences lgls as a treatment for hepatitis b virus hbv infection 
all rights to ana have reverted to lgls 
we also halted our early stage discovery efforts 
the strategic restructuring included an immediate reduction in our workforce of approximately one third  with several additional positions eliminated in early we expect the reduction in force to generate annual savings of between million and million 
we incurred a charge of approximately million in severance costs  continuation of benefits and outplacement services in connection with the workforce reduction as of december  in addition  we incurred a non cash charge of million associated with the modification of stock options for individuals included in the reduction in force 
on august   steve worland  phd  the company s president  pharmaceuticals  was appointed as the company s president and chief executive officer and was also appointed to the company s board of directors 
effective august   lawrence c 
fritz  phd resigned as president and chief executive officer and from the board of directors of the company 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue the development of ana for the treatment of hcv  continue the development of ana for the treatment of cancer  develop methods for and scale up manufacturing of ana and ana for clinical trials and potential commercialization  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and potentially in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are synergistic with our own 

table of contents research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
research and development expenses may include direct external costs such as fees paid to consultants  joint development collaboration costs and related contract research  and internal direct and indirect costs such as compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation 
under our former collaboration with novartis for the development of ana  novartis funded of the development costs and we funded of such development costs 
reimbursements of development costs for ana from novartis were recorded as an offset to research and development expense 
payments to novartis for its portion of development costs for ana were recorded as a component of research and development expense 
for the years ended december    and  we have recorded as offsets to research and development expense million  million  and million  respectively  which represents novartis share of ana expenses incurred by us 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we advance our product candidates through clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are currently focused on advancing the development of ana  a small molecule  non nucleoside inhibitor of the nsb polymerase for the treatment of hepatitis c and ana  an oral tlr agonist prodrug for cancer

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis and make adjustments to the consolidated financials statements as considered necessary 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies involve the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition 
we may receive payments from collaborators for compound licenses  technology access fees  option fees  research services  milestones and royalty obligations 
these payments are recognized as revenue or reported as deferred revenue until they meet the criteria for revenue recognition as outlined in staff accounting bulletin  no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on revenue recognition in financial statements  and is based on the interpretations and practices developed by the sec  and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services were rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
specifically  we have applied the following policies in recognizing revenue revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at the comparable level and iii the milestone is not refundable or creditable 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront fees under our collaborations  such as technology access fees  are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
non refundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
fees that we receive for research services are generally recognized as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
research services may include activities in which we deploy our internal capabilities such as our medicinal chemistry and screening capabilities to assist a collaborator in advancing their drug discovery effort 
drug development costs 
we review and accrue drug development costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on subject enrollment  estimated timeline for completion of studies and other events 
these costs and estimates vary based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial and the length of dose period for each subject as well as other factors 
drug development costs are subject to revisions as trials and studies progress to completion 
expense is adjusted for revisions in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by a black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense evenly over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method on january  under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date of sfas no 
r  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements for sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
eitf requires collaborators to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
further  eitf clarified that the determination of whether transactions within a collaborative arrangement are part of a vendor customer or analogous relationship subject to eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf will be effective for us beginning on january  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf will be effective for us beginning on january  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
furthermore  sfas establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas will be effective for us beginning on january  if adopted  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards required or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas will be effective for us beginning on january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenue 
we recorded revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we and novartis decided to discontinue the development of ana as a result  during the year ended december  we recognized million of previously deferred revenue representing the remaining unrecognized portion of the million up front payment  received from novartis in  and the million ind milestone payment  received from novartis in  which were previously being recognized into revenue over the estimated development period of ana this completed the recognition of the deferred revenue under the novartis collaboration 
the million increase from to was primarily attributed to the recognition of the remainder of the million up front payment and the million ind milestone payment 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded revenues of million and million  respectively  associated with the amortization of our million up front payment and million ind milestone payment from novartis 
this increase in revenue was offset by a decrease in revenue from our collaboration with roche 
we recorded revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  from our collaboration with roche 
in january  we completed our portion of our collaboration with roche 
during the years ended december  and we recorded revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our phase ii sbir grant 
during the year ended december   we concluded our performance under the phase ii sbir grant 
fluctuations in our collaboration related revenue were dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to  the timing of agreements  the conclusion of agreements  the timing of the workflow under the agreements  our collaborators abilities to provide us with the materials and information necessary for us to conduct our portion of the collaboration effort and the occurrence of events that may trigger milestone payments to us 
we are not currently party to any revenue generating agreements 
our revenues may fluctuate in future periods if we enter into new agreements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily due to an increase in external preclinical development costs for ana and ana the increase was partially offset by a decrease in development costs associated with ana and cost savings associated with our restructuring effected during  including the halting of early stage discovery efforts 
included in research and development expense for the year ended december   is million of severance related costs associated with our restructuring 
we included  as a component of research and development expense during the year ended december   million of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the million increase in research and development expense from to was primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january  and an increase in personnel related expenses 
we included  as a component of research and development expense during the year ended december   million of share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r 
during the year ended december   we included million as a component of research and development expense with respect to amortization of deferred compensation on employee stock options in accordance with accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

personnel related expenses increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this personnel related expense was driven by an overall increase in research and development personnel 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in share based compensation from to  partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our restructuring and other severance related costs 
the higher share based compensation expense during was largely driven by the acceleration of the unvested stock options held by kleanthis g 
xanthopoulos  phd our former president and chief executive officer and current member of our board of directors upon his resignation as president and chief executive officer 
we calculated the additional share based expense associated with the modification and acceleration of dr 
xanthopoulos unvested stock options upon his termination in accordance with sfas r 
included as a component of share based compensation expense during the year ended december  was million of share based compensation expense related to the stock options granted to dr 
xanthopoulos 
the million increase from to was primarily the result of the modification of dr 
xanthopoulos unvested stock options during interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in our interest income from to was the result of a lower average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balance during compared to our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the decrease in our average cash balance from to was driven by our use of cash  cash equivalents and securities to fund our on going operations 
the million increase in our interest income from to was the result of a higher average cash balance in compared to our average balance of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale was million in compared to million in the higher average cash balance was driven by the receipt of the following amounts which were invested into interest bearing securities during an up front license payment of million from novartis in july  million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  from our follow on public offering of common stock in august and a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda received in september interest expense 
interest expense was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our interest expense of million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is the result of our payment in full of our outstanding principle balance of million on our equipment financing line of credit in february liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities decreased by million from december  to december  which represents the use of our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale to fund our operations during the year ended december  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale includes the receipt of million from novartis which represented novartis share of ana development costs for the period july  through june  
table of contents cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities purchase of securities available for sale proceeds from sale of securities available for sale purchase of property and equipment proceeds from disposal of property and equipment net cash used in provided by investing activities cash flows used in operating activities increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of the termination of our collaboration with novartis during under our former collaboration with novartis for the development of ana  novartis funded of the development costs and we funded of such development costs 
during  most of our resources were directed toward the development of ana and ana which resulted in a higher usage of cash since both of these product candidates are funded by us 
cash flows used in provided by operating activities decreased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of the receipt of the up front license payment of million from novartis in july and the receipt in september of a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda during the year ended december  also contributing to the fluctuation in our cash flows provided by used in operating activities during the year ended december  to the year ended december  was the fluctuation in our accounts receivable balance as a result of the timing of payments from novartis associated with its portion or our development costs for ana and the reduction in development costs associated with ana as a result of the halting of our phase ib clinical trial in june as of december   we had included million from novartis in our accounts receivable balance for its portion of development costs for the period june  through december  this amount was paid during in comparison  we included million due from novartis in our accounts receivable balance as of december  for novartis portion of development costs for the period july  through december  the overall decrease in the accounts receivable balance from to reflects a reduction in spending on the ana project as a result of the halting of our phase ib clinical trial for ana during cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the overall reduction in the cash flows used in investing activities from to is primarily related to the use of the proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale used to fund the operations of the company during the overall reduction in the cash flows provided by used in investing activities from to is primarily related to the company shifting its investment portfolio from investments with maturities over three months  to investments with maturities less than three months 
during as investments classified as available for sale matured  the proceeds from these securities were either used to fund operations of the company or the proceeds were reinvested in investments classified as cash equivalents to take advantage of their shorter maturity terms 
during and  the company continued to invest in investments with shorter maturities to take advantage of the rising interest rate environment 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in financing activities proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan proceeds from sale of common stock  net of issuance costs proceeds from long term debt principal payments on long term debt net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of the outstanding principal due under the loan and security agreements with gatx ventures and general electric capital corporation being paid in full during february cash flows used in financing activities decreased by million from to the decrease was primarily a result of the receipt of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  from our follow on public offering of common stock completed during august aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than to to contractual obligations total year thereafter operating leases minimum royalty commitment we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations that conduct our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the number of subjects enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
to date  the majority of our clinical costs have been related to the costs of subjects entering our clinical trials as well as the manufacturing of compounds to be used in our clinical trials 
costs associated with clinical trials will continue to vary as the trials go through their natural phases of enrollment and follow up 
the costs will also be influenced by the pace and timing of the development activities 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current product development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
as we continue our development programs  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our product candidates will be subject to future partnering  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when  or if  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 

table of contents future cash requirements we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the advancement of our development programs 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our preclinical development activities  the progress of our clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana  ana or any other product candidates we may develop  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and securities available for sale will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next fiscal year 
we expect to incur substantial expenses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we continue to review our programs and resource requirements 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities or received under former collaboration agreements 
in addition  we likely will need to finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements  project financing and or debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and securities available for sale resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
other financing arrangements  such as project financings  may also have an equity component  also resulting in dilution to existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
