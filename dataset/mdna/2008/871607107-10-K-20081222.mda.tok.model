with respect to our designware core intellectual property products  we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications 
fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus  in some cases  royalties 
finally  our global technical services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project 
proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
we have a diversified portfolio of more than patents issued and more than pending patent applications in 
table of contents the united states and in foreign jurisdictions 
our issued patents have expiration dates through our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products 
our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work 
however  third parties may develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future 
we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent  copyright  trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights 
in many cases  under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
for example  we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it

table of contents item a 
risk factors we describe our business risk factors below 
the current severe downturn and uncertainty in the global economy in general and weakness in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may harm our business and operating results 
the worldwide economy is currently undergoing unprecedented turmoil amid stock market volatility  tightening of credit markets  concerns of inflation and deflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and business insolvencies 
this turmoil and the uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively impact our customers and  among other things  postpone their decision making  decrease their spending and jeopardize or delay their ability or willingness to make payment obligations  any of which could adversely affect our business 
uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also cause volatility of our stock price 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of this severe global economic downturn or subsequent recovery 
in addition  the semiconductor and electronics industries are cyclical in nature and are currently experiencing a severe downturn 
the eda industry has been adversely affected by many factors  including the current global downturn  ongoing efforts by semiconductor and electronics companies to reduce their spending  uncertainty regarding their long term growth rate and underlying financial health  excess eda tool capacity and increased competition 
these factors could  among other things  limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the general economy and the semiconductor and electronics industries do not improve  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results 
the majority of our backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered 
a significant portion of revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash 
although customer payment obligations are not cancelable  we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default  declare bankruptcy  or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed 
moreover  existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses 
though we have not  to date  experienced a material level of defaults or renegotiation requests  if the current economic downturn is prolonged  our customers financial condition and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations could be adversely affected 
if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments  our operating results would be harmed 
if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed 
we compete with eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services  primarily cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation  inc we also compete with other eda vendors  including continual new entrants to the marketplace  that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process  as well as with customers internally developed design tools and capabilities 
we compete principally on technology leadership  product quality and features including ease of use  license terms  post contract customer support  interoperability with our own and other vendors products  price and payment terms 
specifically  we believe the following competitive factors affect our success technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly and in order to be successful we must maintain technology leadership 
accordingly  we must successfully anticipate and lead critical 
table of contents developments  innovate rapidly and efficiently  improve our existing products  and successfully develop or acquire new products 
we believe that in order to be successful we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance 
we have invested significant resources into the development of our galaxy design platform  integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of our systemverilog and other advanced features and development of our manufacturing solutions and our ip and systems portfolios 
customers may not find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors offerings and our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance may not be successful 
some eda vendors are increasingly offering discounts  which could be significant  as price continues to be a competitive consideration for our customers 
if we do not match or are unable to match a competitor s pricing for a particular solution or if we are unable to otherwise enhance the value of our offering  we may lose business  which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results  particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other eda purchases with the competitor 
we believe that in order to compete effectively  we need to enhance the value of our offering by providing additional rights such as multiple copies of the tools  post contract customer support  expanded license usage related to duration  location and quantity  contractor and site access  future purchase rights and the ability to purchase pools of technology 
if we do not match or are unable to match a competitor s offering  we may lose business  which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results 
payment terms are aggressively negotiated by our customers and affect our competitive position 
payment terms on time based licenses have generally lengthened over time 
longer payment terms could continue in the future  which could negatively affect our future revenue and operating cash flow 
the eda industry is subject to continual consolidation 
we and our competitors have historically acquired businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings 
if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to exert even greater competitive pressure by offering a more complete or larger technology portfolio  a larger support and service capability  or lower prices 
despite the complexity of the eda market  entry and expansion into the eda market by new and existing companies can and does occur  and could make it more difficult to compete successfully 
in addition  new competitive factors may emerge from time to time 
if we fail to successfully compete as described above or fail to address new competitive forces our business will be harmed 
lack of growth in new ic design starts  industry consolidation and other potentially long term trends may adversely affect the eda industry  including demand for our products and services 
the increasing complexities of socs and ics  and customers concerns about managing costs and risks have also led to the following potentially long term negative trends in our industry the number of ic design starts has remained flat during the last several years 
new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software 
a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely 
mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services  
table of contents and in some cases  increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers  including synopsys 
due to factors such as increased globalization  cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent  adversely impacting our customers eda spending 
industry changes  plus the cost and complexity of ic design  may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general  to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design 
all of these trends  if sustained  could harm the eda industry  including the demand for our products and services  which in turn would harm our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects  including changes to our prior financial statements  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles  or in our interpretations of these principles  can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results 
we have received a revenue agent s report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our us taxable income 
an adverse outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
on july   we received a revenue agent s report in which the internal revenue service  or irs  proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for fiscal through of approximately million  million of which would be a reduction of certain tax credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in future periods 
in august  we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs  which will cause the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs 
an adverse outcome of this matter could result in significant tax expense and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
unfavorable tax law changes  an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business  including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense  could result in a material increase in our tax expense 
our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state  local and foreign taxing authorities 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the irs examinations of our federal tax returns for the years and resulted in significant proposed adjustments 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates 
certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates 
therefore  any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions  including 
table of contents those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of or amendments to foreign tax rulings  could materially increase our effective tax rate 
furthermore  we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states 
changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results 
our revenue and earnings fluctuate and if our financial results fail to meet stockholder expectations our stock price could decline 
many factors affect our revenue and earnings  including customer demand  license mix  the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold  causing our revenue and earnings results to fluctuate 
accordingly  stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance 
from time to time  we provide targets related to our future financial performance 
in addition  financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance 
because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate  future financial performance is difficult to predict 
downward adjustments of our targets or the failure to meet our targets or the expectations of research analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include  but are not limited to the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers products  customer research and development and eda budgets  pricing  our competitors product offerings and customer design starts 
it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customers demand for our products on a medium or long term basis 
as a result  actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which  in turn  could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly disclosed targets 
we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue  any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income 
our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time based license revenue 
the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders  customer demand  customer payment terms and ship dates could result in lower revenue and harm our operating results 
for example  if we ship more licenses generating upfront revenue than expected during any given fiscal period  our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target  conversely  if we ship fewer licenses generating upfront revenue than expected  our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target 
similarly  if we receive a lower than expected level of license orders generating time based revenue during a given period  our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected 
we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally communicated financial targets  any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could harm our business 
we often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products 
although these amendments can provide a longer term payment stream from the customers  
table of contents they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger 
certain of our license agreements provide customers the right to re mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products 
while this practice helps assure the customer s access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product  use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately 
in the past  we have regularly received a significant portion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter 
the delay of one or more orders  particularly an order generating upfront revenue  could cause us to have lower revenue and or earnings for that quarter 
a large portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers 
while our agreements with such customers are binding multi year agreements  if we were to lose these customers or if they did not renew their agreements with us  over time our financial results could be adversely affected 
we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition  specifically determining the existence of proper documentation  establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable  verifying delivery of our products and services and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers 
while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future 
in such an event  we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods  which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods 
our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products  either alone or against competing products  before making a purchase decision 
accordingly  our customers evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters 
further  sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles 
the sales cycle for our products is lengthy 
the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
this commitment often requires significant technical review  assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within a customer s organization 
while our customers are evaluating our products and services  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and spend significant management effort to complete these sales 
any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter or the failure to complete a sale after expending resources during the sales cycle could cause our operating results to suffer 
we rely on third party subcontractors to manufacture our hardware products 
our reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and pricing changes 
our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries  lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships with our customers resulting in lower operating results 
the failure to meet the semiconductor industry s demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may harm our financial results 
soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease  substantially increasing the complexity  cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing 
to address greater complexity  
table of contents semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers 
at the same time  as a general business trend  we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk 
in order to succeed in this environment  we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements and increase the value of our products  while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 
if we fail to successfully manage these conflicting demands our financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated  which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors  our entry into new markets  or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts  our operating expenses would increase 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue  our operating results could decline 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results 
in order to remain competitive  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 
we may not be able acquire businesses or technology and we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the business acquisitions or strategic investments we complete  which could hurt our ability to grow our business  develop new products or sell our products 
we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in the past and expect to make additional acquisitions of businesses or technology in the future 
we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks  which could harm our operating results 
we have acquired a number of companies and technologies in recent years  including synplicity  inc in may in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including potential negative impact on our earnings per share  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  problems in integrating the acquired products with our products  difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into synopsys  failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings  regulatory delays  drain on management time for acquisition related activities  assumption of unknown liabilities  including tax  and unanticipated costs  
table of contents diversion of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or investments  and adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships 
while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us  an acquisition may not positively affect our future performance 
if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology  we will be required to write down intangible assets associated with the product or technology which would harm our operating results 
conditions of foreign economies  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance 
during fiscal  and  we derived approximately of our revenue from outside the united states 
we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from customers outside the united states 
foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic  political and health conditions  including the effects of international political conflict  hostilities and natural disasters 
further  any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states 
our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies  including the euro  the japanese yen and the canadian dollar  as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar 
exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while we hedge most foreign currency exposures of our business  we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures  and our hedging activities may not completely mitigate our foreign currency risks 
in addition  we have expanded our non us operations significantly in the past several years 
while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions and higher international sales  this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees  manage multiple  remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states 
if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed 
our operations and sales to customers internationally subject us to a number of additional risks  including international economic and political conditions  such as political tensions between countries in which we do business  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulatory requirements  differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices  our inability to adapt to cultural differences in the conduct of business  inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions  exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  
table of contents financial risks such as longer payment cycles  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  and other factors beyond our control such as terrorism  civil unrest  war and infectious diseases 
our investment portfolio may be impaired by further deterioration of the capital markets 
our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of october  consists of investment grade municipal bonds  tax exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
as of october   we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds was close to of total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which we do not consider to be material 
as of october   we had no impairment charge associated with our short term investment portfolio 
however  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and our investment portfolio may suffer other than temporary impairments in future periods 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it 
these types of claims can  however  result in costly and time consuming litigation  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products  invalidate a patent or family of patents  require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products  any one of which could harm our business and operating results 

table of contents if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on agreements with customers  employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
moreover  some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited 
we aggressively pursue action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies 
we engaged in anti piracy efforts against certain companies located in china  but these actions may not be successful 
we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the propriety rights of others 
if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent  copyright or trade secret protection  for any reason  or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions  our business and operating results would be harmed 
in addition  intellectual property litigation is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board 
many of these regulations continue to evolve  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
in addition  our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  section of sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our auditors to render an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
this effort has required  and will continue to require in the future  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm could cause our stock price to decline 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 
we do not expect that our disclosure controls or control system will prevent all error and all fraud 
regardless of how well designed and operated it is  a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us 

table of contents if we fail to timely recruit and retain key employees our business be harmed 
to be successful  we must attract and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees  including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions 
there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers  and competition for these individuals is intense 
our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers 
any failure to recruit and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation 
we face pressure from stockholders  who must approve any increases in our equity pool  to limit the use of such equity based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders 
in addition  we are required under us gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit equity based compensation 
these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity based packages in the future  which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 
product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm reputation and we could lose market share 
despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products  software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced  when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies 
product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products 
in addition  allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could  even if untrue  adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us 
any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers  increase our service costs  subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications  and technology systems for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities  our data centers  and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
we believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events  but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our operating results would be adversely affected

please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part of this annual report regarding forward looking statements 
business environment summary we generate substantially all of our revenue from customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and development r d budgets and  to a lesser extent  their manufacturing and capital budgets 
as a result  our customers business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs affect their spending decisions and vendor selections 
over the past several years  customers have increasingly faced competing challenges of technological complexity and cost pressures 
many electronics companies have refined their business strategies by focusing on their areas of differentiation and in some cases exiting non differentiating areas 
for example  some have outsourced semiconductor manufacturing to a third party foundry or manufacturing consortium 
these challenges have varying impacts on members of the electronic design automation eda industry in which we operate 
the eda industry is very competitive 
while the importance of offering a broad  integrated portfolio of solutions  along with sizeable  global support  continues to grow  no one factor drives an eda customer s buying decision and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers budget 
our customer arrangements are complex  involving hundreds of products and various license rights 
many of our customers are large businesses  purchasing substantially all of the capabilities our products offer 
our customers are increasingly focused on reducing their overall costs by demanding a broader portfolio of solutions  support and services 
in addition  they bargain intensely on all aspects of the contractual arrangement  seeking more favorable terms at an overall lower cost 
as such  customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 
we provide our products in four common groupings  or platforms  with hundreds of products within each platform 
we enhance the value of our offerings by providing additional rights such as multiple copies of the tools  post contract customer support  expanded license usage related to duration  location and quantity  contractor and site access  future purchase rights and other unique rights 
in some instances  we provide customers with the ability to purchase pools of technology to address a broad spectrum of their design needs and enable our customers to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for unspecified future technology 
we also offer post contract customer support and services 
these elements of added value  in addition to per copy pricing  are some of the many factors which our customers consider when making purchasing decisions 
historically  revenue has grown primarily as a result of increased customer demand for these additional rights related to our products  and  more recently  as a result of the impact of our business model shift as discussed below 
in general  as our customers negotiate increased rights  the value of the contracts with those customers increases 
collectively  the increase in the value of all of our customer contracts is the primary driver of our overall growth in revenue over time 
as further described below  the effect of an increase in value for a particular customer is typically recognized over the life of the customer contract rather than in the particular period in which the enhanced license transaction is completed 
as a result of customers seeking to conserve cash  we shifted our business model in the fourth quarter of to allow a substantial majority of our customers to pay for licenses over a period of 
table of contents time  rather than upfront at the time of initial purchase 
extended payment terms  as well as arrangements with technology pools and rights to unspecified future products  generate recurring revenue over a period of time  generally three years  rather than non recurring upfront license revenue 
accordingly  most of the revenue we recognize in any particular quarter results from our selling efforts in each of the prior periods during the last three or so years rather than from efforts or changes in the current period 
this business model reduces our dependence on license arrangements that generate non recurring upfront license revenue in a particular period and provides us with the ability to resist typical software industry quarter end pressures and to decline business with terms  including pricing terms  which may be less favorable to us 
we continue to target achieving greater than of our total revenue as recurring revenue  which we refer to in our financial statements as time based license and maintenance and service revenue 
fiscal financial performance summary total revenue of  million was up from  million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to bookings of technology subscription licenses tsls in prior periods which increase time based revenue recognized in later periods and to a lesser extent from synplicity product sales from our acquisition in may time based license revenue of  million was up from  million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to bookings of tsls in prior periods which increase time based revenue recognized in later periods 
upfront license revenue of million was up from million in fiscal the increase included the impact of synplicity product sales 
we derived approximately of our total revenue from time based revenues  maintenance and services  and from upfront revenue in fiscal  compared to approximately and  respectively  in fiscal this reflects our continued adherence to our business model 
maintenance revenue of million was down from million in fiscal this decrease in maintenance revenue was primarily attributable to the fact that maintenance has been bundled and not charged separately after the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal professional service and other revenue of million was up from million in fiscal  increased primarily due to the timing and acceptance of performed milestones under existing service contracts 
net income of million was up from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in revenues 
fiscal  and acquisitions we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years  and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future 
below is a list of our principal acquisitions during the last three fiscal years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our acquisitions  which information is included herein 
fiscal synplicity  inc provides innovative field programmable gate array fpga  ic design and verification solutions that served a wide range of communications  military aerospace  semiconductor  consumer  computer  and other electronic applications markets 

table of contents fiscal archpro design automation  inc provides low power verification technologies designed to help customers address power management challenges in multi voltage designs 
assets of mosaid technologies inc increases the breadth of synopsys offerings in standards based connectivity intellectual property by adding a line of double data rate ddr memory controllers and related products 
sandwork design  inc provides tools to efficiently analyze and debug complex analog and mixed signal systems on chips  complementing synopsys existing simulation solutions

sigma c software ag provides simulation software that helps increase ic wafer yields by allowing synopsys customers to perform more accurate design layout analysis 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading result of operations below are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and net income 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions  judgments and estimates  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations  are revenue recognition  valuation of share based compensation  valuation of intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue 
software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software 
maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees 

table of contents we have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
with respect to software licenses  we utilize three license types technology subscription licenses tsls are time based licenses for a finite term  and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive  or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
we bundle and do not charge separately for post contract customer support maintenance for the term of the license 
term licenses are also for a finite term  but do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term 
the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional years 
perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 
for the three software license types  we recognize revenue as follows tsls 
we typically recognize revenue from tsl fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period  or as customer installments become due and payable  whichever is later 
revenue attributable to tsls is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
term licenses 
we recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
for term licenses in which less than of the license fee is due within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
such revenue is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
for perpetual licenses in which less than of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
we generally recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a technology subscription license is incorporated into the hardware  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the software license period  or as customer installments become due and payable  whichever is later 
revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received and recognize revenue from professional service and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer 
revenue attributable to maintenance  professional services and training is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method  we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term  and we recognize revenue from professional services as milestones are performed and accepted 
we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of software or services has occurred  the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the full license or service fee is probable 
all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement 
we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement  our customary policy is to have a written contract  signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the customer s hardware 
for physical deliveries  the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
we generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders 
however  a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and  as a result  timing of revenue recognition  including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a quarter 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require or more of the license fee to be paid within one year 
if the arrangement includes these terms  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the arrangement does not include these terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
in the case of a tsl  because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because vsoe for maintenance services does not exist for a tsl  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license  but not in advance of when customers installments become due and payable  even if the fee is otherwise fixed or determinable 
collectability is probable 
we judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for a new customer  or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review 
we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer 

table of contents if we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received 
valuation of share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our share based awards 
we determine the expected term of our share based awards based on historical experience 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on share based awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future share based compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
valuation of intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  contract rights intangibles  customer installed base relationships  trademarks and trade names  covenants not to compete  customer backlog  capitalized software development and other intangibles 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal as of october   the carrying amount of our intangible assets  was million 
income taxes 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
our estimates and assumptions used in such provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and resolved 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin and fasb staff position no 
fsp fin in the first quarter of fiscal the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in may  the fasb issued fsp fin which amended 
table of contents fin to provide guidance about how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
under fsp fin  a tax position could be effectively settled on completion of an examination by a taxing authority if certain other conditions are satisfied 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the net deferred tax assets of million that are recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
however  if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
included in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of million of which million will expire from fiscal through and the remaining million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies  which have a valuation allowance of million  will expire between fiscal and foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten years  unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period  and may only be used after foreign tax credits arising in each subsequent year have been used first 
our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million during the fiscal year with respect to our foreign tax credit carryforward  of which million was recorded as a result of the final irs settlement 
see results of operations income taxes irs examinations  below  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the need for a valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credits is subject to change based upon a number of factors  including the amount of foreign tax credits arising in future years  our forecasts of future foreign source income  the amount of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changes in income tax laws that may affect our ability to use such credits 
as of october   we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future  we would provide taxes on such excess amount 
as of october   there was approximately million of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes 
if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed  we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  we would record an additional charge to earnings 
see results of operations income taxes irs examinations  below  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the revenue agent s reports from the irs we received in june and july asserting very large net increases to our us tax arising from the audit of fiscal through and fiscal through  respectively 

table of contents results of operations our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest october our current fiscal year ended november  every seven years we have one extra week in our fiscal year that occurs in our first quarter 
fiscal and were week years 
fiscal was a week fiscal year and the additional week was contained in the first quarter 
the extra week in fiscal resulted in approximately million of additional revenue related primarily to time based licenses and approximately million of additional expenses 
revenue background we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses  hardware products  maintenance and professional services 
under current accounting rules and policies  we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times 
in most instances  we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is shipped 
substantially all of our current time based licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years 
maintenance orders normally bring in revenue ratably over the maintenance period normally one year 
revenue from professional service orders is generally recognized as milestones are performed and accepted by the customer 
upon the acquisition of synplicity  we began selling hardware products and to recognize revenue generally upon shipment 
a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under critical accounting policies and estimates 
our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time based license  upfront license  hardware product sales  maintenance and professional service revenue for the period 
we derive time based license revenue in any quarter largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters 
we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter 
we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year 
we also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters  since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted  not when they are booked 
our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period 
a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods 
for example  a  order for a three year tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter  but  in each of the twelve succeeding quarters 
conversely  perpetual licenses and term licenses with greater than of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg  a  order for a perpetual license generates  in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped  but no future revenue 
total revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to bookings in prior years leading to increased current period time based license revenue 
additionally  total revenue increased by approximately due to the strength of the japanese yen against the u 
s dollar 
the increase was partially offset by fiscal having one less week of revenue of approximately million compared to fiscal 
table of contents the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased bookings of licenses generating time based revenue reflecting the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the transition to more tsls in prior periods that continued to contribute to time based license revenue in later periods  and the fact that fiscal had weeks compared to weeks in fiscal  resulting in one week s additional time based revenue being recognized in fiscal the increase was partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and service revenue 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact to fiscal as compared to fiscal as discussed above in the business environment summary  we shifted our business model in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal and forward  the model shift itself no longer contributes to the increases in total revenue or time based revenue 
time based license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in time based license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher bookings in fiscal which contributed to the increase of time based license revenue in fiscal tsl revenue continued to be the major contributor to total revenue since our business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  but to a lesser extent  the increase in time based license revenue in fiscal from fiscal resulted from entering into more contracts in which revenue was recognized as installment payments become due and payable 
the increase was partially offset by fiscal having one less week of revenues of approximately million compared to fiscal the increase in time based license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased bookings of tsls in prior periods which increased time based revenue recognized in later periods  the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal and transition to more tsls in prior periods that continued to contribute to time based license revenue in later periods  and the fact that fiscal had weeks compared to weeks in fiscal  resulting in one week s additional time based revenue being recognized in fiscal upfront license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to new synplicity product sales 
the slight increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to normal changes in customer license type requirements during the year and is consistent with our shift towards tsls 

table of contents maintenance and service revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions maintenance revenue professional service and other revenue total percentage of total revenue our maintenance revenue declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our completed shift towards tsls  which include maintenance with the license fee and thus generate no separately recognized maintenance and service revenue  and the first quarter of fiscal having one less week of revenues  resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately million compared to fiscal our maintenance revenue declined in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to our shift towards tsls  which include maintenance with the license fee and thus generate no separately recognized maintenance revenue  as well as non renewal of maintenance by some customers on perpetual or term licenses 
professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to timing of customer acceptance of performance milestones and services performed under ongoing contracts 
events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses functional allocation of operating expenses 
we allocate certain human resource  information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement based on headcount within each functional area 
annually  or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction  realignment or acquisition or other factors  management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool 
cost of revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue amortization of intangible assets total percentage of total revenue we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue  and amortization of intangible assets 
expenses directly associated with providing consulting and training are allocated between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and service revenue reported 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes costs associated with our software product sales as well as our costs of materials associated with our hardware products 
additionally  cost of license revenue also includes allocated costs of license delivery  such as employee salaries and benefits related to software production costs  product packaging  product delivery  amortization of capitalized software development costs  documentation and royalties to third party vendors 
cost of maintenance and service revenue 
cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and associated costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization 
further  cost of maintenance and service revenue also includes allocated costs which provide post customer contract services  such as employee salary and benefits related to customer services  such as hotline and on site support  production services and documentation of maintenance updates 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets  which is amortized to cost of revenue and operating expenses  includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core developed technology  trademarks  tradenames  customer relationships  covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was flat at for both fiscal and fiscal the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in personnel related costs as a result of our acquisition of synplicity in fiscal  an increase of million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described  and an increase of million in direct costs as a result of hardware costs 
the increase was partially offset by the decline in fair value of million in our deferred compensation plan obligation  and one less week of costs of approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in total cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and employee benefits due to our increased personnel costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and in late fiscal  an increase of million in direct costs as a result of increased shipments during fiscal  weeks of costs in fiscal instead of weeks in fiscal  and million increase in functionally allocated expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in amortization of certain intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized during fiscal operating expenses research and development year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in employee personnel related costs as a result of headcount increases  including from our recent acquisition  and an increase of million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described compared to fiscal the increase was partially offset by million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation as a result of the overall decline of the financial market  the absence of a million earn out retention bonus related to a prior year acquisition  and one extra week of costs incurred in fiscal of approximately million 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in increased personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and in late fiscal  in addition to an extra week of expenses in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in share based compensation expense  a decrease of million in general operational activities such as expenses for travel  entertainment  communications  depreciation  and to a lesser extent by reductions in functionally allocated expenses compared to fiscal sales and marketing year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in personnel related costs as a result of a decrease in headcount and the impact of million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation  and one less week of costs of approximately million compared to fiscal the decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in employee  travel and communication related expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in variable compensation as a result of increased shipments  and an increase of million in sales and marketing personnel related costs  employee functions and an extra week of expense in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in general operation activities such as travel  entertainment  communications  depreciation and a million reduction in functionally allocated expenses compared to fiscal general and administrative year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in personnel related costs  and an absence of million gain for a land sale completed during fiscal and recorded as an offset to expense under this line item 
the increase was partially offset by million decline in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan obligation  and one less week of expenses of approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in expenses related to professional services primarily for legal  sarbanes oxley act compliance  tax and audit matters  a decrease of million in depreciation expense as a result of improving efficiencies in our operations and cost control efforts  and a gain of million  net of related expenses  for a land sale recorded as an offset to expense under this line item 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in expense related to facility operations  a net increase of million in functionally allocated expenses  and an extra week of expenses in fiscal change in fair value of deferred compensation 
the income or loss due to the change in fair value of the non qualified deferred compensation plan obligation is recorded in each functional operating expense 
the offsetting income or loss due to the change in fair value of the non qualified deferred compensation plan asset is recorded in other income  net 
the overall net impact to our consolidated statements of operations from the income or loss of our deferred compensation plan obligation and assets is immaterial for all periods presented 
the decrease in fair value of deferred compensation plan obligation is reported in total cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the year over year effect of the fair value change is approximately million 
this change is a result of the declining financial markets in fiscal correspondingly  the decrease in the fair value of the deferred compensation plan asset is approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal and reported in other income  net 
change in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan did not have a material impact to total cost of revenue or total operating expenses in fiscal and fiscal see note and of notes to consolidated financial statements employee benefit plans and other loss income  net 
effect of foreign currency on expenses 
foreign currency fluctuations  net of hedging  did not have a significant impact to expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal or fiscal as compared to fiscal in process research and development 
in process research and development iprd expense is comprised of in process technologies of million associated with the acquisition of synplicity in fiscal  million associated with the acquisitions of archpro design automation and sandwork design in fiscal  and million associated with the acquisition of hpl technologies in fiscal at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 
valuation of iprd 
upon acquisition of other companies  we expense any iprd as it represents incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital  taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology  the successful development of the iprd  its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at the time of determination 
synplicity 
on may   we acquired synplicity  inc synplicity  a leading supplier of innovative fpga and ic design and verification solutions 
the iprd expense related to this acquisition was million  and consisted of four primary projects in process at the time of acquisition fpga  asic verification  dsp  and haps 
we expect that these projects will be completed over a period of approximately two years 
sandwork 
on october   we acquired sandwork design  inc sandwork  a company with tools to efficiently analyze and debug complex analog mixed signal ams systems on chips socs 
the iprd expense related to this acquisition was million 
sandwork had two projects in process at the time of acquisition which we anticipate will be completed over a period of approximately two years 
archpro 
on june   we acquired archpro design automation  inc archpro  a company with modern power management verification technologies 
the iprd expense related to the archpro acquisition was million 
archpro had several projects in process at the time of acquisition which we anticipate will be completed over a period of approximately two years 
hpl 
on december   we acquired hpl technologies  inc hpl  a yield management and test chip technology company 
the iprd expense related to the hpl acquisition was million 
hpl had one iprd project which was completed during fiscal and the resulting products have begun to generate revenue 
the expenditures to complete hpl s acquired in process technologies approximated the original estimates 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core developed technology  trademarks  trade names  customer relationships  covenants not to compete  and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years 
amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions included in cost of revenue included in operating expenses total percentage of total revenue amortization of capitalized software development costs is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to completion of the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior years acquisitions  partially offset by the intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of synplicity 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior year s acquisitions

table of contents other income  net year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions interest income income loss on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan foreign currency exchange gain loss other  net total see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the employee benefit plans 
for fiscal  the amount included a litigation settlement of million received from magma 
income taxes the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of october   current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
non current deferred tax assets  net of non current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance  and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 
included in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of million of which million will expire from fiscal through and the remaining million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies  which have a valuation allowance of million  will expire between fiscal and foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten years  unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period  and may only be used after foreign tax credits arising in each subsequent year have been used first 
our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million during fiscal with respect to our foreign tax credit carryforward  of which million was recorded as a result of the final irs settlement 
see results of operations income taxes irs examinations  below  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the need for a valuation allowance with respect to foreign tax credits is subject to change based upon a number of factors  including the amount of foreign tax credits arising in future years  our forecasts of future foreign source income  the amount of our undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and changes in income tax laws that may affect our ability to use such credits 
as of october   we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future  we would provide taxes on such excess amount 
as of october   there was approximately million of earnings upon which income taxes have not been provided 

table of contents effective tax rate the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for fiscal  and year ended october  dollars in millions income before provision for income taxes provision for income tax effective tax rate the fiscal tax rate is lower than fiscal primarily due to a favorable resolution being reached on transfer pricing issues related to the irs examination and additional research credits claimed on our federal and state tax returns 
in addition  in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted  which retroactively extended the research and development credit from january  through december  the fiscal tax rate is lower than fiscal primarily due to lower withholding taxes as a result of restructuring of certain of our foreign operations  and increased research credits 
for fiscal  the effective tax rate includes state tax expense of million for prior year state taxes  primarily as a result of state tax audits settled and a settlement offer made in fiscal and associated interest and penalties  as well as a reduction in an estimated fiscal state research and development credit benefit 
tax effects of stock awards 
in november  fasb issued a staff position fsp on fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
effective upon issuance  this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
we elected to use the alternative transition method in fiscal and have not recognized any excess tax benefits during fiscal years  and no tax benefit was recorded in the fiscal years  and for expenses relating to the vesting of qualified stock options and share based compensation costs which are borne by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
irs examinations we are regularly audited by the irs 
fiscal years on june   we received a revenue agent s report rar in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years and of approximately million  plus interest 
this proposed adjustment primarily related to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
on july   we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs  which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs 
on june   the irs and synopsys executed a final closing agreement pursuant to which substantially all of the proposed assessment was eliminated 
as a result of the final resolution of the transfer pricing issue  we decreased our fin liabilities by million in the third quarter of  including interest accrued of million and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of million 
concurrently  we evaluated our ability to use certain foreign tax credit carryovers which have been recorded as noncurrent deferred tax assets in its 
table of contents balance sheet  a portion of which may have been available to offset the fin liability 
we concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that million of our foreign tax credits will be used prior to the expiration of the carryover period  and recorded a valuation allowance for this amount 
accordingly  our provision for income taxes includes an income tax benefit net of decreases in related deferred tax assets of million as a result of the irs settlement 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the statute of limitations remains open with respect to fiscal years for two related issues until the appeals office of the irs has considered certain refund claims relevant to these years which are affected by the fiscal year federal income tax audit 
we have accrued the tax for these issues in accordance with a tentative settlement we reached with the irs in december fiscal years in the third quarter of  the irs started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years through in july  the irs completed its field examination of these returns and issued an rar in which the irs proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for the three year period of approximately million  million which would be a reduction of certain tax losses and credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in future periods 
the irs is contesting our tax deduction for payments made in connection with litigation between avant corporation and cadence design systems  inc in addition  the irs has alleged that we are required to make an additional transfer pricing adjustment with a wholly owned non us subsidiary as a result of our acquisition of avant in the irs has also proposed adjustments to our transfer pricing arrangements with our foreign subsidiaries  deductions for foreign trade income and certain temporary differences 
we have agreed to additional taxes of approximately million for these proposed adjustments  which have been fully provided for in prior years 
the total adjustments proposed by the irs  if sustained  would also result in additional state taxes net of the federal tax benefit for state taxes paid of approximately million 
the irs imposes interest on any resulting tax deficiencies 
on august   we timely filed a protest with the irs and will seek resolution of these issues through the appeals office of the irs 
we strongly believe that the proposed irs adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws  and that we have meritorious defenses to this proposed adjustment 
the rar is not a final statutory notice of deficiency 
we believe we have adequately provided for all potential tax liabilities related to these years 
final resolution of these matters is expected to take several years 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 
the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal cash and cash equivalents and short term investments october  change change dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total 
table of contents during fiscal  our primary sources and uses of cash consisted of cash generated from operating activities of million  proceeds from sales and maturities of investments  net of purchases  of million  net payments related to acquisitions of million  repurchases of common stock of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and proceeds from issuances of common stock of million 
cash flows year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions cash provided by operations cash used in investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements 
to be classified as upfront revenue  we require that of a term or perpetual license fee be paid within the first year 
conversely  payment terms for tsls are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually in even increments over the term of the license 
accordingly  we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time based licenses revenue 
fiscal to fiscal cash from operating activities decreased primarily due to the timing of billings and cash payments from customers compared to fiscal  delivering lower cash inflows during fiscal and also as a result of a litigation settlement of million received from magma during fiscal fiscal to fiscal cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased collections largely as a result of payments received from a significant customer  a litigation settlement of million received from magma during fiscal  and decreased commission payments and timing of payments to vendors compared to fiscal cash used in investing activities 
fiscal to fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities primarily relates to the sale of marketable securities for our acquisition of synplicity  and as a result of lower capital expenditures during fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal to fiscal the increase in cash used primarily relates to acquisitions  purchases of marketable securities related to our increased collections and the timing of maturities of marketable securities  and our capital expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure  partially offset by cash received for the sale of land in san jose  california for million  net of related fees 
cash used in provided by financing activities 
fiscal to fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities primarily relates to larger common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and a lower number of employee option exercises compared to fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of our stock repurchase program 

table of contents fiscal to fiscal the increase in cash provided primarily relates to a higher amount of option exercises by employees and lower stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program compared to fiscal we hold our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and in foreign accounts  primarily in ireland  bermuda  and japan 
as of october   we held an aggregate of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and an aggregate of million in foreign accounts 
funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america 
at present  such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries as described in income taxes above 
we expect cash provided by operating activities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including timing of our billings and collections  our operating results  the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions 
accounts receivable  net october  change change dollars in millions our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities 
our dso was days at october  and days at october  the increase in dso along with a slight increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to timing of billings to customers that occurred during the year with subsequent payment terms and our collections 
net working capital 
working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of october   our net working capital was million  compared to million as of october  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in income taxes receivable of million  an increase in current deferred income tax asset of million  and a decrease of million primarily due to a reclassification from short term accrued income taxes to long term accrued income taxes upon our adoption of fin this increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  a decrease in prepaid and other assets of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
other commitments credit facility 
on october   we entered into a five year  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to synopsys and certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional million through the fourth year of the facility 
the facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash  as well as other non financial covenants 
the facility terminates on october  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  however  we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between and based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
in addition  commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between and per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
as of october   we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants 

table of contents other our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of october  consists of investment grade municipal bonds  tax exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds 
we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor  manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  some financial instruments  such as structured investment vehicles  sub prime mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns 
as of october   we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds was close to of total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which we do not consider to be material 
during fiscal we had no impairment charge associated with our short term investment portfolio 
while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  we have taken steps  including regularly reviewing our investments and associated risk profiles  which we believe will allow us to effectively manage the risks of our investment portfolio 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations  and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter other in thousands long term obligations lease obligations capital lease operating leases purchase obligations long term accrued income taxes total this commitment relates to the fees associated with the revolving credit facility as discussed in other commitments above 
additional information is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
long term accrued income taxes represent uncertain tax benefits as of october  recorded in accordance with fin currently  a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of payments in individual years beyond fiscal cannot be made due to uncertainties in timing of the commencement and settlement of potential tax audits and controversies 

table of contents in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to october   we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash during the two years subsequent to fiscal if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved 
because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals  these amounts are not reflected in the table above 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
as of october   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of october  carrying value weighted average total return in thousands money market funds us cash deposits and money market funds international short term investments us total interest bearing instruments as of october   the stated maturities of our current short term investments are million within one year  million within one to five years  million within five to ten years and million after ten years 
however  we consider these investments to be short term in nature because  in accordance with our investment policy  the weighted average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short term obligations and other uses including acquisitions 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax

we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary s local currency  except for our principal irish  swiss and hungarian subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the us dollar 
we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including certain assets and liabilities  shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month  future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders  and certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below 
the duration of forward contracts ranges from one month to months 
a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
to the extent our estimates are correct  gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
for example  if the euro were to depreciate by compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october   the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately million  and we would be required to pay approximately million to the counterparty upon contract maturity 
at the same time  the us dollar value of our euro based expenses would decline  
table of contents resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts
