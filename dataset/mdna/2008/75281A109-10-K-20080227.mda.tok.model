item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see disclosures regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
items impacting the comparability to prior year reports in march  we sold our gulf of mexico properties for proceeds of million 
accordingly  the financial and statistical data contained in the following discussion for all periods presented reflects the reclassification of our gulf of mexico operations to discontinued operations 
overview of our business we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  primarily in the southwestern  appalachian and gulf coast regions of the united states 
we operate in one segment 
we have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
our corporate headquarters are in fort worth  texas 
industry environment we operate entirely within the united states  a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
as a mature region  while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the united states  the size and frequency of these discoveries is generally declining  while finding and development costs are increasing 
we believe that there remain areas of the united states  such as the appalachian basin and certain areas in our southwest and gulf coast areas  which are underexplored or have not been fully explored and developed with the benefit of newly available exploration  production and reserve enhancement technology 
examples of such technology include advanced d seismic processing  hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation  advances in well logging and analysis  horizontal drilling and completion techniques  secondary and tertiary recovery practices  and automated remote well monitoring and control devices 
another characteristic of a mature region is the historical exit of larger independent producers and major oil companies from such regions 
these companies  searching for ever larger new discoveries  have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore  de emphasizing their onshore united states assets 
this movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets 
in other situations  to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending  larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures and farm in arrangements 
we believe the acquisition market for oil and gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities 
acquisition values have reached historic highs and we expect these values to remain high in in addition  we expect drilling and service costs to remain at a high level in and for lease operating expenses to continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields 
oil and gas is a commodity 
the price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand 
demand for natural gas in the united states has increased dramatically over the last ten years 
demand is impacted by general economic conditions  estimates of gas in storage  weather and other seasonal condition  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
market conditions involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect the volatility to continue in the future 
a factor impacting the future supply balance is the recent increase in the united states lng import capacity 
significant lng capacity 
table of contents increases have been announced which may result in increased price volatility 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets 
source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of oil and gas that is produced from our properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced  the prevailing market price at the time of sale  quality  btu content and transportation costs to market 
the price of oil and natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas and oil production 
during and the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods 
our realized price calculations include the effects of the settlement of derivative contracts that are accounted for as hedges and the settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges 
principal components of our cost structure direct operating expenses 
these are day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include workovers and repairs to our oil and gas properties 
these costs are expected to remain high in as the demand for these services continues to increase 
direct operating expenses also include stock based compensation expense non cash associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r and amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
production and ad valorem taxes 
these costs are taxes paid on produced oil and gas based on a percentage of market prices not at hedged prices or at fixed rates established by federal  state or local taxing authorities 
exploration expense 
geological and geophysical costs  including payroll and benefits for the geological and geophysical staff  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory or dry holes 
exploration expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r and amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
general and administrative expense 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our production and development operations  audit and other professional fees and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r and amortization of restricted stock grants as part of employee compensation 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with our longer term debt securities 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we will likely continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
we expect our capital budget to be funded primarily with internal cash flow and asset sales 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this expense includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
this category also includes unproved property impairment and costs associated with lease expirations 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis 
currently  substantially all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  at some point  we anticipate using all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of income and operations overview of results during  we achieved the following results achieved production growth and reserve growth  drilled net wells  continued expansion of drilling inventory and emerging plays  posted record financial results and continued balance sheet improvements  and completed acquisitions of properties containing bcfe of proved reserves 
our performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of growth through drilling and complementary acquisitions 
the business of exploring for  developing  and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating meaningful growth while containing costs presents an ongoing challenge 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  drilling service and operating cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
we faced other challenges in including attracting and retaining qualified personnel  consummating and integrating acquisitions  and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth on sufficiently favorable terms 
we have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals 
our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to be strong  providing new growth opportunities  greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency 
total revenues increased in over the same period of this increase is due to higher production and higher realized oil and gas prices 
our production growth is due to the continued success of our drilling program and to acquisitions completed in and realized prices were higher by in as discussed in item a of this report  significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a significant impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations  including the fair value of our derivatives 
oil and gas sales  production and realized price calculations our oil and gas sales vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold 
hedges realized reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting 
oil and gas sales increased from due to a increase in production and an increase in realized prices 
oil and gas sales in increased from due to an increase in production and a increase in realized prices

table of contents derivative fair value income loss decreased to a loss of million in compared to a gain of million in and a gain of million in in the fourth quarter of  certain of our gas hedges no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to the effect of gas price volatility on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices 
also  as a result of the sale of our gulf of mexico assets in the first quarter of  the portion of our derivatives which were designated to our gulf of mexico production was marked to market resulting in fair value income of  in the fourth quarter of  we began marking a portion of our oil hedges designated as permian basin production to market due to the anticipated sale of a portion of our permian properties resulting in derivative fair value loss of million 
the loss of hedge accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as gains and losses from non hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in our balance sheet in accumulated other compensation loss 
as commodity prices increase or decrease such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark to market value of our derivatives 
because oil prices increased dramatically in  our derivatives became comparatively less valuable 
however  we expect these losses will be offset by higher wellhead revenues in the future 
beginning in the third quarter of  we have also entered into basis swap agreements which do not qualify for hedge accounting purposes and are marked to market 
hedge ineffectiveness included in this category is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no

due to significant price declines after the purchase of these properties and volumes produced since the acquisition  we recognized an impairment of million 
these properties were also sold in the first quarter of see also note to our consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations  a committed bank credit facility  asset sales and access to both the debt and equity capital markets 
during  our net cash provided from continuing operations of million  proceeds from our april common stock offering of million  proceeds from our september note offering of million and proceeds from the sale of assets of million were used to fund billion of capital expenditures including acquisitions and equity investments 
at december  we had million in cash and total assets of billion 
our debt to capitalization ratio was at december  compared to at december  as of december  and  our total capitalization was as follows in thousands bank debt senior subordinated notes total debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization ratio long term debt at december  totaled billion  including million of bank credit facility debt and million of senior subordinated notes 
our available borrowing capacity at december  was million 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves which is typical in the oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves 
we believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs 
however  long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and remain profitable 
we operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
our ability to expand our reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves 
bank debt we maintain a million revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on october  availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances 
the borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 

table of contents at february   the bank credit facility had a billion borrowing base and a million facility amount 
credit availability is equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base resulting in credit availability of million on february  the facility amount can be increased to the borrowing base with twenty days notice 
our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes 
under the bank credit facility  common and preferred dividends are permitted 
the terms of each of our subordinated notes limit restricted payments including dividends to the greater of million or a formula based on earnings and equity issuances since the original issuances of the notes 
the senior subordinated notes due in and also allow for any cash proceeds received within twelve months from the sale of oil and gas properties purchased in an acquisition using stock as consideration to be added to the restricted payment basket 
at december   approximately million was available under the restricted payment baskets for each of the senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes and the senior subordinated notes due in there was billion available under the restricted payment basket for the senior subordinated notes due the bank credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of million plus of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and of net income 
approximately million was available under the bank credit facility restricted payment basket as of december  the debt agreements contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence  working capital  dividends and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  cash flow our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow  bank borrowings  asset sales and at times  issuance of debt and equity securities 
our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
as of december   we had entered into hedging agreements covering bcfe for and bcfe for the million of cash capital expenditures for  excluding acquisitions  was funded with internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales 
the billion capital budget for  which excludes acquisitions  is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base 
based on current projections  oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position  the capital program is expected to be funded  primarily with internal cash flow and asset sales 
net cash provided from continuing operations in was million  compared to million in and million in in  cash flow from continuing operations increased due to higher production volumes and higher realized prices partially offset by increasing operating costs

the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties and million of acquisitions 
the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties and million of acquisitions 
net cash provided from financing activities in was million  compared to million in and million in historically  sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due and proceeds of million from a common stock offering 
during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due during  the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility declined million primarily due to the proceeds received from the senior subordinated notes due being applied to our bank debt 
during  we also received proceeds of million from a common stock offering 
capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
during  million of capital was expended on drilling projects 
also in  million was expended on acquisitions primarily to purchase additional interests in producing properties and unproved acreage 
the capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded by net cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales 
the capital budget of billion  excluding acquisitions  is expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations and asset sales 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow and asset sales 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our 
table of contents ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
cash dividend payments the amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and primarily depends on earnings and capital expenditures 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders per share in the fourth quarter and per share in the third  second and first quarters 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common stockholders per share in the fourth quarter and per share in the third  second and first quarters 
in  we paid million in dividends to our common stockholders per share in the second and third quarters and per share in the fourth quarter 
also in  we paid million in preferred stock dividends 
future commitments in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and operating leases 
as of december   we do not have any capital leases nor have we entered into any material long term contracts for equipment 
as of december   we do not have any significant off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below  our balance sheet at december  reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of  which is payable in the first quarter of we expect to make annual interest payments of million per year on our senior subordinated notes  million per year on our senior subordinated notes due  million per year on our senior subordinated notes and million per year on our senior subordinated notes due the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities

we expect to renew our bank credit facility  but there is no assurance that can be accomplished 
interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance 
b derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of december  while such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received after our payments to counterparties which can result in borrowings under our bank credit facility 
c this table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets 
hedging oil and gas prices we enter into derivative agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility 
at december   swaps were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of to and million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of to 
the derivative fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination  based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  approximated a pretax loss of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december settled transaction gains and 
table of contents losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas sales in the period the hedged production is sold

we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our consolidated statement of operations in the caption derivative fair value income loss 
as of the fourth quarter of  certain of our gas derivatives no longer qualified for hedge accounting and are marked to market 
also  as a result of the sale of our gulf of mexico assets in the first quarter of  a portion of derivatives which were designated to our gulf coast production was marked to market 
in the fourth quarter of  we began marking a portion of our oil hedges designated as permian production to market due to the anticipated sale of a portion of our permian properties 
derivatives that no longer qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method described above 
as of december   hedges on bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting 
during the third and fourth quarter of  in addition to the swaps and collars above  we entered into basis swap agreements which do not qualify as hedges for hedge accounting purposes and are marked to market 
the price we receive for our production can be less than nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments 
the fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre tax gain of  at december  interest rates at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged at year end the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
inflation and changes in prices our revenues  the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business 
in a trend that began in and accelerated through  commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly 
the higher prices have 
table of contents led to increased activity in the industry and  consequently  rising costs 
these cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on our capital costs 
we expect these costs to remain high for the following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and quarterly for  and average price calculations exclude all derivative settlements whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting

management s discussion of critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes  and b the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
oil and gas properties proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines 
table of contents for reserves established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price and cost changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates used by us 
we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our senior vice president of reservoir engineering who reports directly to our chief operating officer 
to further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates  we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves 
historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 
the following table sets forth a summary of the percent of reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended  and audited a a audited reserves are those reserves estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant 
we use the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers 
costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and b we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
proven property leasehold costs are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves 
properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant at least annually and impairments to value are charged to expense 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
we adhere to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated at least quarterly as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
we consider a combination of time  geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
unproved properties had a net book value of million in compared to million in and million in depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in note to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
we monitor our long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  future abandonment costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustment to reserves  physical damage to production equipment and facilities  a change in costs  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
we cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 

table of contents we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions 
oil and gas derivatives we enter into derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production 
these contracts have historically consisted of options  in the form of collars  and fixed price swaps 
under sfas no 
 every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective 
some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but are effective as economic hedges of our commodity price exposure 
these contracts are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method 
under this method  the contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions unrealized derivative assets and unrealized derivative liabilities 
we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts on our consolidated statement of operations under the caption derivative fair value income loss 
as of the fourth quarter of  certain of our gas derivatives no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to the effect of volatility of gas prices on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices 
also  as a result of the sale of our gulf of mexico assets in the first quarter of  the portion of derivatives which were designated to our gulf coast production no longer qualified for hedge accounting resulting in derivative fair value income of  in the fourth quarter of  we began marking a portion of our oil hedges designated as permian production to market due to the anticipated sale of a portion of our permian properties resulting in derivative fair value loss of million 
these derivatives that no longer qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method described above 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we entered into basis swap agreements which do not qualify as hedges for hedge accounting and are also marked to market 
the price we receive for our gas production can be less than the nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location  or basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreement that effectively fix our basis adjustments 
while there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising oil and gas prices may not be captured  we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important 
among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions  the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital  smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs  more consistent returns on invested capital  and better access to bank and other credit markets 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of retirement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation  aro  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense  a component of depletion  depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations 
due to the sale of our gulf of mexico assets in the first quarter of  our aro liability decreased million 

table of contents deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require oci to be considered  even though such income or loss has not yet been earned 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized deferred hedging gains included in oci 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized hedging losses included in oci 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition oil  gas and natural gas liquids are recognized when the products are sold and delivery to the purchaser has occurred 
we use the sales method the account for gas imbalances  recognizing revenue based on gas delivered rather than our working interest share of gas produced 
accounting standards not yet adopted in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measure at fair value 
it requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be recorded in net income 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
for us  sfas no 
will be effective january   and retrospective application is not permitted 
should we elect to apply the fair value option to any eligible items that exist at january   the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value would be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we will adopt sfas no 
as of january  and the impact of the adoption will result in a reclassification of a million pre tax loss related to our investment securities from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement

table of contents assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
the statement will apply prospectively to business combinations occurring in our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating provisions of this statement 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
all accounts are us dollar denominated 
market risk our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
commodity price risk we periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production 
these arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty 
our derivatives program also includes collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price 
historically  we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our oil and gas production 
accordingly  we recorded change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts  including changes associated with time value  under the caption  accumulated other comprehensive income loss and into oil and gas sales when the forecasted sale of production occurs 
any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period under the caption derivative fair value income loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but are effective as economic hedges of our commodity price exposure 
these contracts are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method 
under this method  the contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions unrealized derivative gains and unrealized derivative losses 
we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our consolidated statement of operations under the caption derivative fair value income loss 
generally  derivative losses occur when market prices increase  which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction 
conversely  derivative gains occur when market prices decrease  which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   we had oil and gas swaps in place covering bcf of gas 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
these contracts expire monthly through december the fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of december   approximated a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding period contract type volume hedged average hedge price fair market value in thousands natural gas swaps  mmbtu day  collars  mmbtu day  swaps  mmbtu day  collars  mmbtu day  crude oil collars  bbl day  collars  bbl day  
table of contents other commodity risk we are impacted by basis risk  caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity 
natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets 
if commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions  derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge  resulting in increased basis risk 
in addition to the collars and swaps above  during the third and fourth quarter of  we entered into basis swap agreements which do not qualify for hedge accounting purpose and are marked to market 
the price we receive for our gas production can be less than the nymex price because of adjustments for delivery location basis  relative quality and other factors  therefore  we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments 
the fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre tax gain of  at december  in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenue by million 
if oil and gas futures prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging gain at that date would have increased million 
interest rate risk at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged on that date 
on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest rates 
the fair value of our subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices 
the following table presents information on these fair values in thousands carrying fair value value fixed rate debt senior subordinated notes due the interest rate is fixed at a rate of senior subordinated notes due the interest rate is fixed at a rate of senior subordinated notes due the interest rate is fixed at a rate of senior subordinated notes due the interest rate is fixed at a rate of
