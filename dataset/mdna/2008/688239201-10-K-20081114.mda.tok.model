all estimates referred to in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to the company s estimates as of november  when the company conducted a conference call in connection with its announcement of its earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended september  and its outlook for fiscal recent acquisitions since  the company has selectively pursued strategic acquisitions to enhance its product offerings and diversify its business 
the company has focused its acquisition strategy on providing a full range of products to customers in specialty vehicle and vehicle body markets that are growing and where it can develop strong market positions and achieve acquisition synergies 
acquisitions completed during the past three fiscal years include during fiscal  the company acquired jlg for billion  including transaction costs and the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired 
jlg is a leading global manufacturer of access equipment based on gross revenues 
the results of jlg s operations are included in the consolidated results of the company from the date of acquisition

executive overview during fiscal  the company experienced sharp year over year swings in demand  commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates that led to sharply higher sales  operating income and earnings per share in the first half of the fiscal year followed by sharp declines in operating income and earnings per share in the second half of the fiscal year 
early in the fiscal year  the company enjoyed robust demand in europe and other global markets at its higher margin access equipment segment 
for example  access equipment sales doubled in europe  africa and the middle east in the second fiscal quarter 
a weak us dollar further enhanced segment margins in the first half of fiscal the strength in international access equipment more than offset weakness in other parts of the company s business that were facing weak demand in the us at that time  most economists believed that europe and the rest of the world could escape the us economic downturn 
defense segment sales were also strong in the first half of the fiscal year and remained strong throughout the year 
beginning in the third fiscal quarter  conditions began to progressively deteriorate 
first  steel and fuel costs began to escalate globally  which led to component cost escalation 
then in june  access equipment orders fell sharply in western europe and the company experienced unexpected order cancelations in that region as the weak us economy spread to parts of western europe 
a competitor reported experiencing a similar sudden slowdown in june these items  along with slower realization of the benefits of a facility rationalization plan  led the company to change its view about its ability to turn around the profitability of geesink  its european refuse collection vehicle business  to the extent and in the timeframe orginally anticipated because near term demand was likely to decline from previous expectations due to weakening economies and its contract manufacturing income from fabrications for jlg was likely to fall as access equipment demand in europe was declining 
these events led the company to pre announce a third fiscal quarter earnings shortfall on june  due primarily to weaker than expected access equipment sales and pre tax charges totaling million related to the impairment of intangible assets at geesink 
in the fourth fiscal quarter  the company began to experience the brunt of the commodity cost escalation 
also  in the fourth quarter  access equipment demand softened further in europe and domestically as the economic downturn intensified and the us dollar began to strengthen  which together with the cost escalation  adversely impacted jlg operating results compared to both earlier in the fiscal year and to the prior year 
significant market share gains in the company s domestic fire apparatus and domestic refuse collection vehicle businesses mitigated the earnings shortfall in the second half of fiscal in october  the financial crisis intensified  and the economic downturn experienced in the us and western europe had spread to the rest of europe and asia 
as the company enters fiscal  it expects to continue to face difficult conditions 
in light of these conditions  the company has been preparing to withstand weaker markets while continuing to drive initiatives to capitalize on the next economic upturn 
in june  as costs escalated and demand fell in access equipment  particularly in western europe  the company began to review and reduce its cost structure and reduce production to match lower demand 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its workforce by approximately and reduced discretionary spending in a manner the company believes will yield more than million in annual cost savings beginning in fiscal the company also moved to increase its low cost country sourcing of materials 
production rate declines permitted the company to reduce inventories by million and debt by million in the fourth quarter 
in october and early november  the company developed plans to further reduce its workforce by approximately and began to work with suppliers to roll back some of the fiscal cost increases now that steel and fuel costs have declined somewhat 
the company has continued its strong focus on working capital reduction 
the company expects to reduce its debt by million in its first quarter of fiscal and has targeted million or more of aggregate debt reduction in fiscal the company expects to continue these actions as necessary in fiscal to respond to global changes in demand 
in fiscal  the company expects higher defense sales  due to recent high defense budgets and supplemental bills  and higher fire apparatus and domestic refuse collection vehicle sales  due to market share gains  to provide a foundation for the company s financial performance in fiscal the company further believes that  with its leading market positions  recent fhtv contract award  strong innovation and aftermarket support and projected cash generation  the company will be favorably positioned to capitalize on the next economic upturn in the us and globally 
as discussed in part i  item a  risk factors section of this annual report on form k  the company s markets are highly cyclical and the company has experienced declines in several of its markets over the last months 
based on the company s current outlook  there are scenarios under which the company could fall out of compliance with the financial covenants contained in its credit agreement 
however  the company is proceeding with a plan with the objective of avoiding the need to amend the credit agreement by maintaining compliance with its financial covenants or at least delay seeking an amendment to mitigate any financial impact 
the plan involves targeting million or more of debt reduction in fiscal and maintaining strong fiscal management 
if the company is not successful in delivering the higher end of its earnings per share estimate range for fiscal and timely debt reduction of million or more  then the company will need to request an amendment to its credit agreement 
in the event that the company would need to amend its credit agreement  the company would likely incur substantial up front fees and significantly higher interest costs than reflected in the company s earnings per share estimate range for fiscal and other terms in the amendment would likely be significantly less favorable than those in the company s current credit agreement 
the company believes  based on discussions with its lead banks  that an amendment could be obtained if ultimately necessary  but no assurance can be given that this will remain the case at such time that the company may request such an amendment 
the company believes that it has adequate liquidity to operate its business 
details of the company s financial performance in fiscal compared to fiscal and its expectations for its financial performance in fiscal compared to fiscal follow percentage increase decrease vs 
prior year fiscal fiscal estimate sales operating income net income earnings per share assuming dilution company estimates as of november  consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal the inclusion of jlg in the results for the entire fiscal year in as compared to only ten months in fiscal  strong access equipment sales in europe  significantly higher defense sales and favorable foreign currency exchange rates drove the increase in consolidated net sales 
while revenue grew during fiscal  operating income declined million  or  from the prior year to million and earnings per share fell to  or  from fiscal the lower operating results in fiscal were largely driven by the million pre tax  non cash impairment charges the company recorded during the third quarter for the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets at geesink 
lower operating performance for certain operating units  including geesink  within the commercial and fire emergency segments as a result of lower sales combined with higher corporate costs also contributed to the significantly lower earnings during fiscal access equipment experienced solid sales growth outside of north america through the third fiscal quarter  until economies in western europe began to slow  causing a sharp and sudden slowdown in order activity in certain western european markets in june access equipment sales increased in fiscal primarily driven by the inclusion of jlg s results for the entire twelve month period in fiscal versus only ten months of ownership in the prior year period and higher international demand  partially offset by lower demand in the us access equipment segment operating income was million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal operating income margins in fiscal benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a favorable product and customer mix 
since the onset of operation iraqi freedom in  the company s defense segment has benefited substantially from increasing dod requirements for new trucks  parts  service  armoring and remanufacturing of the company s defense vehicles operated in iraq 
during fiscal  the company s defense segment increased production of new and remanufactured trucks to meet the requirements of its largest customer  the dod  in its mission to successfully complete operation iraqi freedom 
as a result  defense segment sales rose in fiscal  while sales of new and remanufactured trucks increased over and parts and service sales increased nearly in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
due to a higher mix of lower margin truck sales  lower negotiated margins on the fhtv contract and inefficiencies on the start up of a contract  operating margin declined from of sales in the prior year to of sales in fiscal as a result  operating income for the defense segment only increased for fiscal compared to the prior year 
the company s fire emergency segment experienced sales growth of in fiscal compared to fiscal  but operating income declined 
the increase in sales reflected higher domestic fire apparatus sales as a result of continued market share gains and higher airport products sales due to international sales growth  offset in part by weaker demand for towing equipment as well as mobile medical trailers and broadcast vehicles 
the decrease in operating income for fiscal was the result of softness in the towing equipment markets as well an operating loss at osv  the company s domestic mobile medical trailer and broadcast vehicle business 
sales in the company s commercial segment decreased in fiscal the decrease in sales was largely attributable to recessionary declines in concrete placement product sales as a result of lower us residential construction and lower demand subsequent to the pre buy ahead of the january diesel engine emissions standards changes in the us sales at the company s european refuse collection vehicle business were up in fiscal as compared to the prior year due largely to stronger demand in the netherlands and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s commercial segment incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal compared to operating income of million in the prior year 
the operating loss was related to losses at geesink and a decrease in domestic concrete placement product sales 
geesink sustained an operating loss of million in fiscal compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal the increase in the operating loss was primarily due to non cash charges for the impairment of intangible assets of million  costs associated with the rationalization of manufacturing facilities  inefficiencies associated with the relocation and start up of production of norba branded products in the netherlands and increased material and warranty costs 
in june  it became evident that synergies related to geesink s facility rationalization program would be lower than expected and costs to execute the rationalization would be higher than anticipated 
the resulting slower than expected and more difficult return to profitability of geesink s business  further escalation of raw material costs and a reduction in fabrication volume for the company s access equipment segment at geesink s romania facility due to a slowdown in the european access equipment market led to the company s conclusion that the charges for impairment were required 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  the company determined that geesink goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets were impaired and the company recorded the non cash impairment charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal the company expects to record improved results  albeit still a loss  at this business in fiscal as it continues to work to improve the operational efficiency of this business 
the company s focus in fiscal will be on managing costs  generating cash flow and reducing debt 
the financial credit crisis has created much uncertainty about near term future economic conditions and has made it more difficult to project results for fiscal the company expects that current economic conditions will negatively impact a number of its businesses into or through all of fiscal the company estimates that its sales will decrease to billion and that its earnings per share will range between and 
the company expects continued weakness in economies worldwide to significantly affect sales in the access equipment segment and concrete placement portion of its commercial segment in fiscal  driving consolidated sales down from billion in fiscal the company expects that the decreases in sales in these two businesses will be partially offset by a strong increase in defense segment sales due to us government requirements for new heavy payload tactical vehicles 
the company expects consolidated operating income margins to be between and as a result of lower sales expectations  under absorption of fixed costs and increases in the costs of raw materials in the access equipment segment  offset in part by the expected return to profitability of the company s commercial segment

access equipment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was driven by the inclusion of jlg sales for the entire year compared to the company s ownership for ten months in the prior year period and significantly stronger demand for aerial work platforms outside north america 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates also increased sales by million 
these increases were offset in part by lower demand in north america in fiscal compared to the prior year as a result of slowing non residential construction markets 
access equipment sales in the prior year represented sales of jlg from december   the date of acquisition  through the end of the fiscal year 
defense segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in sales of new and remanufactured trucks  as well as higher parts and service sales 
sales of new and remanufactured trucks were up versus the prior year as an increase in sales of new and remanufactured heavy payload trucks was partially offset by a decrease in medium payload truck sales and international truck sales 
parts and service sales increased nearly in fiscal on significantly higher armor kit shipments and service work 
fire emergency segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sales reflected higher domestic fire apparatus sales as a result of continued market share gains and higher airport product sales  due partially to higher international sales  offset in part by weaker demand for towing equipment as well as mobile medical trailers and broadcast vehicles 
the towing equipment vehicle market was negatively impacted by lower demand as a result of rising fuel prices and uncertainty in the us economy 
a reduction in medical reimbursement rates by the us government to providers of mobile medical imaging services had a negative effect on sales of mobile medical trailers  and during the first half of fiscal  a writers strike reducing television networks advertising revenues negatively impacted the broadcast vehicle market 
commercial segment net sales decreased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of lower domestic concrete placement product sales in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a slowdown in us residential construction and low volume subsequent to the pre buy ahead of the january diesel engine emissions standards changes  offset in part by an increase in european refuse collection vehicle sales 
european refuse collection vehicle sales were up in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher demand in the netherlands 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates also increased reported sales by million 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales increased billion  or  to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased in all segments 
the acquisitions of osv  imt and jlg contributed billion of the sales increase in fiscal access equipment net sales were billion in fiscal access equipment sales represent sales of jlg from december   the date of its acquisition  through the end of the fiscal year 
after the date of acquisition in fiscal  jlg experienced strong demand in europe and asia for all products and in north america for aerial work platforms 
the segment also benefited from the start up of production of caterpillar branded telehandlers 
the segment experienced softer demand for its traditional telehandlers in north america as a result of a slowdown in residential construction 
defense segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase compared to the prior year was attributable to an increase in sales of new and remanufactured trucks  offset by sharply lower parts and service sales 
sales of medium payload tactical vehicles to the dod in fiscal more than offset a decrease in international truck sales due to the completion of the uk wheeled tanker contract in the first quarter of fiscal the sharp decrease in parts and service sales resulted from the completion of several nonrecurring  large armor and armor installation projects in fiscal fire emergency segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal the acquisition of osv added sales of million in fiscal sales rose for other businesses in the segment  reflecting higher sales for all domestic business units  most notably fire apparatus and towing products 
the increase in domestic fire apparatus sales reflected higher demand for chassis with engines purchased in advance of diesel engine emissions standards changes effective january   increased pricing and some market share gains 
the increase in towing product sales reflected a higher mix of package sales  which include both a wrecker unit and a purchased chassis 
commercial segment net sales increased to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the addition of imt for the full year and higher domestic refuse collection vehicle sales 
the acquisition of imt added net sales of million in fiscal domestic refuse collection vehicle sales were higher in fiscal due to an increase in shipments to large us commercial waste haulers and municipalities 
a decrease of concrete placement product sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  largely due to lower domestic concrete mixer volume subsequent to the january  changes to diesel engine emissions standards and a slowdown in residential construction  partially offset the increase in sales of refuse collection vehicles 
european refuse collection vehicle sales were also down in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to soft demand for the company s products in the united kingdom  the lack of available chassis for mounting refuse collection vehicles in france during the first half of the fiscal year and some market share losses

access equipment segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal operating income margins in the prior year were negatively affected by the timing of the jlg acquisition just prior to jlg s seasonal holiday shut down and charges of million related to the revaluation of inventory at the acquisition date of jlg 
in addition  operating income for fiscal benefited from favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a favorable product and customer mix 
defense segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales during fiscal reflected a higher mix of lower margin truck sales  lower negotiated margins on the fhtv contract and inefficiencies on the start up of a contract  offset in part by the reduction of a warranty reserve upon the expiration of a systemic warranty 
fire emergency segment operating income decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in both operating income and operating income margin was the result of softness in the towing equipment market and adverse product mix as well as operating losses at osv  the company s domestic mobile medical trailer and broadcast vehicle business 
the commercial segment incurred an operating loss of million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to operating income of million  or of sales  in fiscal the operating loss for fiscal included million in non cash charges related to the impairment of intangible assets at geesink 
operating income performance was also negatively impacted by other operating losses at geesink and significantly lower domestic concrete mixer sales as a result of a slowdown in the us residential construction market combined with lower unit volumes subsequent to the pre buy ahead of the january diesel engine emissions standards changes 
geesink sustained an operating loss of million in fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal in addition to the million of non cash charges for the impairment of intangible assets  the increase in the operating loss related to costs associated with the rationalization of manufacturing facilities  inefficiencies associated with the relocation and start up of production of norba branded products in the netherlands and increased material and warranty costs 
corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations increased million to million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal the increase was largely due to higher personnel costs and additional information technology spending to support the company s growth objectives and the reduction of litigation expense reserves in the prior year period 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year due largely to inclusion of jlg for a full twelve months in fiscal consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased largely due to increased corporate expenses 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the acquisitions of osv  imt and jlg contributed million of the operating income increase in fiscal the slight decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales was generally due to lower margins in the company s defense and commercial segments

defense segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in operating income as a percentage of sales during fiscal reflected an adverse truck product mix  inefficiencies on the start up of a contract and lower negotiated margins on the renewal of the fhtv contract  offset in part by the benefit of higher sales and relatively flat operating expenses 
fire emergency segment operating income increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the acquisition of osv added operating income of million in fiscal operating income for the other businesses in the segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in operating income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of strong sales and improved margins at the company s domestic fire apparatus business as a result of ongoing cost reduction initiatives and a decrease in operating losses at the company s ambulance business 
commercial segment operating income decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to operating income of million  or of sales  in fiscal the acquisition of imt added million of operating income in fiscal operating income for the other businesses in the segment fell in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a million operating loss sustained at the company s european refuse collection vehicle operations versus operating income of million in fiscal the operating loss at the company s european refuse collection vehicle operations in fiscal resulted primarily from lower unit volumes  increased warranty provisions and charges totaling million in connection with a reduction in its european refuse collection vehicle business salaried and hourly workforce  the closure of an underutilized facility and other adjustments related to a plan to turn around this business 
corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations increased million to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher personnel costs  higher professional services fees and increased travel expenses  offset in part by lower acquisition investigation and related costs 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased as a result of the leveraging of fixed costs over higher acquisition related sales 
non operating income three years ended september  fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense net of interest income increased million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal  largely as a result of interest on borrowings incurred in connection with the jlg acquisition for a full year in fiscal compared to approximately ten months in the prior fiscal year

fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense net of interest income increased million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal  largely as a result of borrowings incurred in connection with the jlg acquisition 
other miscellaneous loss of million in fiscal related primarily to net foreign currency transaction losses 
provision for income taxes three years ended september  fiscal compared to fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from the impairment of non deductible geesink goodwill  which caused the effective tax rate to increase by percentage points 
the fiscal effective tax rate was positively impacted by a european tax incentive which benefited the effective rate by percentage points offset in part by a valuation allowance on tax net operating losses  primarily in the netherlands  of percentage points 
fiscal compared to fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the rate decrease related to the impacts of the jlg acquisition  a favorable tax audit settlement  a favorable european tax ruling and the re instatement of the federal research and development tax credit

fiscal compared to fiscal equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net of income taxes  of million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily represent the company s equity interest in a lease financing partnership  a commercial entity in mexico and a joint venture in europe 
the increase in equity in earnings in fiscal represents improved performance of the commercial entity in mexico and the addition of the joint venture in europe  which was acquired as part of the acquisition of jlg 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capitalization was as follows september  cash and cash equivalents total debt   shareholders equity   total capitalization debt plus equity   debt to total capitalization in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million  the company had million of unused availability under the terms of its revolving credit facility as defined below as of september  the company s primary cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  and interest and principal payments on indebtedness 
the company finances its activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company s cash flow from operations has fluctuated  and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly  from quarter to quarter  due to changes in working capital requirements arising principally from seasonal fluctuations in sales  the start up or conclusion of large defense contracts and the timing of receipt of individually large performance based payments from the dod 
the company s ability to obtain debt financing at competitive risk based interest rates is partly a function of its existing credit ratios as well as its current credit ratings 
the company s credit ratings are reviewed regularly by major debt rating agencies such as standard and poor s and moody s investors service 
in september  standard poor s ratings services lowered the company long term debt rating from bb to bb  citing expectations for weaker future demand from its key markets 
in may  moody s investors service affirmed the company s corporate rating on the company s long term debt as ba a further downgrade in our credit rating could limit the company s access to public debt markets  could limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities and could make any future credit facility amendment more costly and or difficult to obtain 
as discussed in part i  item a  risk factors section of this annual report on form k  the company s markets are highly cyclical and the company has experienced declines in several of its markets over the last months 
based on the company s current outlook  there are scenarios under which the company could fall out of compliance with the financial covenants contained in its credit agreement 
however  the company is proceeding with a plan with the objective of avoiding the need to amend the credit agreement by maintaining compliance with its financial covenants or at least delay seeking an amendment to mitigate any financial impact 
the plan involves targeting million or more of debt reduction in fiscal and maintaining strong fiscal management 
if the company is not successful in delivering the higher end of its earnings per share estimate range for fiscal and timely debt reduction of million or more  then the company will need to request an amendment to its credit agreement 
in the event that the company would need to amend its credit agreement  the company would likely incur substantial up front fees and significantly higher interest costs than reflected in the company s earnings per share estimate range for fiscal and other terms in the amendment would likely be significantly less favorable than those in the company s current credit agreement 
the company believes  based on discussions with its lead banks  that an amendment could be obtained if ultimately necessary  but no assurance can be given that this will remain the case at such time that the company may request such an amendment 
the company believes that it has adequate liquidity to operate its business 
operating cash flows the company s operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the reduction in cash flows from operations as compared to fiscal was largely the result of higher income tax payments of million and value added tax vat payments  offset in part by a decrease in operating working capital which the company defines as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable and customer advances  which consumed million less cash in fiscal versus the prior year 
the company incurred higher income tax payments in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily because the prior year period benefited from acquisition related deductions 
cash generated used from changes in operating working capital were as follows fiscal year ended september  receivables  net inventories  net accounts payable customer advances cash generated used from changes in operating working capital the increase in cash provided from changes in operating working capital in fiscal was primarily due to higher cash collections on receivables and longer payment terms for accounts payable  offset in part by additional inventory within the access equipment segment and the timing of performance based payments in the company s defense segment 
in fiscal  the acquisition of jlg resulted in an increase in trade accounts receivable and inventory due to the timing of the jlg acquisition during a seasonally slow period 
the access equipment segment had been producing inventory through june based on a combination of orders in backlog and a robust forecast of orders to be received 
in june  the access equipment segment experienced weaker than previously expected orders  a number of order cancellations and notices from several large customers that they would be significantly decreasing their purchases for the remainder of the calendar year  resulting in higher inventory levels at june  than previously planned 
the company has adjusted production within the access equipment segment to reflect the company s revised sales outlook 
during fiscal  the company renewed a large defense contract and realized a performance based payment of million at the time of contract renewal 
the company did not conclude negotiations regarding the renewal of this contract until the first quarter of fiscal  which delayed the initial performance based payment under this contract 
investing cash flows cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to billion in fiscal  which included billion of cash used for the acquisition of jlg in december capital spending  excluding equipment held for rental  of million in fiscal was relatively consistent with capital spending in fiscal capital expenditures were made primarily for increasing capacity  replacing equipment  supporting new product development  and improving information technology systems 
in fiscal  the company expects capital spending to be approximately million 
financing cash flows cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and cash used by financing activities consists primarily of repayments of indebtedness and payments of dividends to shareholders 
financing activities resulted in a net use of cash of million during fiscal compared to cash provided from financing operations of billion during fiscal  which included billion of cash provided by financing activities during fiscal related to borrowings used to finance the acquisition of jlg 
the company has a syndicated senior secured credit agreement credit agreement with various financial institutions  which consists of a five year million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility and two term loan facilities term loan a and term loan b  and collectively  the term loan facility 
the million term loan a requires principal payments of million  plus interest  due quarterly through september  with a final principal payment of million due december  the billion term loan b requires principal payments of million  plus interest  due quarterly through september  with a final principal payment of  million due december  as a result of excess available cash  the company prepaid its quarterly principal payments which were originally due in december and march in addition  the company has paid all of the remaining quarterly principal payments on the term loan b  as well as million of the final principal payment under the term loan b 
the estimated future maturities under the credit agreement for the six fiscal years succeeding september  are as follows million  million  million  million  million and  million 
interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit and term loan facilities are variable and are equal to the base rate which is equal to the higher of a bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate plus or a bank s prime rate or the off shore or libor rate which is a bank s inter bank offered rate for us dollars in off shore markets plus a specified margin 
the margins are subject to adjustment  up or down  based on whether certain financial criteria are met 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding at september  was and for the term loans a and b  respectively 
the credit agreement contains various restrictions and covenants  including requirements that the company maintain certain financial ratios at prescribed levels  and restrictions on the ability of the company and certain of its subsidiaries to consolidate or merge  create liens  incur additional indebtedness and dispose of assets 
the credit agreement also requires maintenance on a rolling four quarter basis of a maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of x for the fiscal quarter ending on september   reducing to x for the fiscal quarters ending on december  through september   and x for fiscal quarters ending thereafter  and a minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of x  in each case tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at september  to manage a portion of the company s interest rate risk  the company entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement on january   which effectively fixed the interest payment of a portion of certain floating rate debt instruments 
the swap  which has a termination date of december   effectively fixed the libor based interest rate on the debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement 
the notional amount of the swap at september  was billion and reduces in varying amounts annually each december until the termination date 
under the terms of the swap agreement  the notional amount of the swap will decline to billion in december neither the company nor the counterparty  which is a prominent financial institution  is required to collateralize their respective obligations under these swaps 
the company is exposed to loss if the counterparty defaults  but the company has no knowledge of any risk of counterparty default as of the date of this filing

the company utilizes blanket purchase orders to communicate expected annual requirements to many of its suppliers or contractors 
requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become firm until four weeks prior to the company s scheduled unit production 
the purchase obligations amount included above represents the value of commitments considered firm  plus the value of all outstanding subcontracts 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for the remaining uncertain tax liabilities

fiscal outlook the company estimates that fiscal consolidated net sales will range between billion and billion  a decrease from fiscal net sales of to 
these estimates assume that worldwide equity and credit markets will stabilize in the next few months 
if these markets do not stabilize  the company would expect access equipment  commercial and  to a lesser extent  fire emergency segment sales to be impacted by lower demand for their products and services 
all comparisons are to the company s fiscal results 
the company expects access equipment segment sales in fiscal will decrease about  plus or minus a couple percentage points 
the decrease in sales reflects weak sales in north america and europe as both residential and non residential construction markets are expected to be weak  offset in part by an increase in demand for some smaller emerging markets and a modest increase in aftermarket sales 
based on additional funding provided for the company s truck programs in recently enacted federal spending bills intended to fund operation iraqi freedom  the company is projecting defense segment sales to grow to in fiscal the company expects fire emergency segment sales to be down to in fiscal  as strength in domestic fire apparatus and airport product businesses is not expected to be sufficient to offset lower demand in the other businesses in the segment 
the anticipated growth at the company s domestic fire apparatus business reflects market share gains as well as announced price increases 
the company estimates commercial segment sales to be flat to down in fiscal  due to continued weakness in residential and non residential construction markets  offset in part by growth in refuse collection vehicle product sales 
the company does not expect to see any increase in demand for concrete placement vehicles in fiscal in advance of the diesel engine emissions standards changes effective january the company is projecting consolidated operating income of between million and million in fiscal  reflecting consolidated operating income margins of between and 
the anticipated reduction in consolidated margin is primarily the result of lower margins in the company s access equipment and defense segments 
the company is projecting access equipment operating income margins to be down to to in fiscal  reflecting under absorption of fixed costs as a result of the expected lower volumes  higher steel and component costs prior to the effective date of the sales price increase and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  offset in part by the benefit of the cost reduction activities taken in fiscal defense segment operating income margins are projected to decrease to basis points in fiscal  reflecting a higher percentage of sales under the lower margin fhtv and lvsr contracts 
fire emergency segment margins are projected to be up approximately to basis points in fiscal  reflecting the impact of recent cost reduction initiatives and improved sales mix among businesses within the segment 
commercial segment operating income margins are projected to be slightly better than break even in fiscal as a result of improved results at geesink  as the majority of the facility rationalization costs were incurred in fiscal  and the benefits of cost reduction initiatives in the segment s domestic businesses 
the company estimates that corporate operating expenses and inter segment profit eliminations will be flat to slightly down compared to fiscal this estimate reflects the benefits of the cost reduction initiatives  offset by additional estimated expense associated with a potential sale of receivables and general inflationary increases 
the company estimates that net interest and other expenses will be approximately million in fiscal largely due to the expected repayment of additional debt incurred in connection with the jlg acquisition 
if the company is unsuccessful with its plan to avoid seeking an amendment of its credit agreement in fiscal  the resulting amendment would likely involve substantial upfront fees and significantly higher interest costs than reflected in this million estimate 
the company estimates that in fiscal its effective income tax rate will be approximately as a result of a reduction in the european tax incentive offset by a reduction in unbenefited losses and the re instatement in october of the research development tax credit 
the company estimates that equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates will approximate million 
during fiscal  the company is targeting to reduce its outstanding debt by million or more  resulting in debt of about billion at september  the company anticipates capital spending to approximate million in fiscal these estimates result in the company s estimates of fiscal net income between million and million and earnings per share between and  assuming that no amendment of its credit agreement is necessary in fiscal critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
the company records revenues under certain long term  fixed price defense contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  generally using either the cost to cost or units accepted method as the measurement basis for effort accomplished 
profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on management estimates of total contract sales value and costs at completion 
estimated amounts for contract changes and claims are included in contract sales only when realization is estimated to be probable 
assumptions used for recording sales and earnings are recognized as a cumulative life to date adjustment in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs 
in the period in which it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract  the entire amount of the estimated loss is charged to cost of sales 
the company accounts for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue  the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales  certain profit is deferred in accordance with lease accounting rules and interest income is recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the company enters into rental purchase guarantee agreements with some of its customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase at the end of the agreement 
at the inception of the agreement  the company records the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
sales incentives the terms for sales transactions with some of the company s distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives  which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual sales 
the company accounts for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition as a direct reduction of sales 
the company reviews its accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or under certain circumstances  a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business 
when estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill  an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions 
see critical accounting estimates 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others the company enters into agreements with finance companies whereby the company will guarantee the indebtedness of third party end users to whom the finance company lends to purchase the company s equipment 
in some instances  the company retains an obligation to the finance companies in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  the company recognizes the greater of the fair value of the guarantee or the contingent liability required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
reserves are established related to these guarantees based upon the company s understanding of the current financial position of the underlying customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the company becomes aware of deterioration in the financial condition of the customer borrower or of any impairment of the customer borrower s ability to make payments  additional allowances are considered 
although the company may be liable for the entire amount of a customer borrower s financial obligation under guarantees  its losses would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment  the finance company s inability to provide clear title of foreclosed equipment to the company  loss pools established in accordance with the agreements and other conditions 
during periods of economic downturn  the value of the underlying collateral supporting these guarantees can decline sharply to further increase losses in the event of a customer borrower s default 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s trade receivables are recorded 
the company evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon the company s perception of the quality of the current receivables  including the length of time the receivables are past due  past experience of collectability and underlying economic conditions 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
goodwill in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
the rate used to discount estimated cash flows is a rate corresponding to the company s cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate  and is dependent upon interest rates at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner to cause an impairment of goodwill  which could have a material impact 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment review relative to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets principally trade names and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
the company s common stock price declined significantly during fiscal  and as a result the market capitalization of the company was below the carrying value of the company as of the goodwill impairment testing date 
the company does not believe that its market capitalization is indicative of the value of the company s reporting units because the current turmoil in the credit and financial markets is temporarily causing equity valuations to fall well below historical valuation parameters and because a control premium would be associated with the company s common stock 
subsequent to the company s annual impairment test  the price of the company s common stock has declined further 
the company believes that the long term economic outlook of the company s business units is not materially different than assumed at the annual impairment analysis date 
in february  the dra was signed into law 
the dra imposes caps on medicare payment rates for certain imaging services  including mri  pet and ct  furnished in physicians offices and other non hospital based settings 
under the caps  payments for specified imaging services cannot exceed the hospital outpatient payment rates for those services 
the implementation of this law has had a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of osv s mobile medical customers in the us during fiscal  osv incurred an operating loss as a result of the slowdown in mobile medical sales and a writers strike during the first half of the year which affected broadcast vehicles sales 
in light of the slowdown in business  the company is expanding in other markets in which osv participates and is consolidating production in existing facilities 
if the company is unable to turn around the business  the company may be required to record an impairment charge for osv s goodwill  and there could be other material adverse effects on the company s net sales  financial condition  profitability and or cash flows 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others the reserve for guarantees of the indebtedness of others requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s guarantees are granted 
the company evaluates the reserve based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
in most cases  the financing company is required to provide clear title to the equipment under the financing program 
the company considers the residual value of the equipment to reduce the amount of exposure 
residual values are estimated based upon recent auctions  used equipment sales and an annual study performed by a third party 
additional reserves  based upon historical loss percentages  are established at the time of sale of the equipment based upon the requirement of fin if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
product liability due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s access equipment  concrete placement and domestic refuse collection vehicle businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company was generally self insured for future claims up to million per claim 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
warranty sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise that are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology may be different  resulting in higher levels of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three fiscal years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by basis points  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million or  and  respectively 
benefit plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data 
income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company will require future taxable income in the netherlands in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset in that jurisdiction 
at september   the company had established a valuation allowance to reserve for the net deferred tax asset related to all tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands 
the company records liabilities for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on october   the company adopted fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  where the company evaluates whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than likelihood of being sustained  zero tax benefit is recorded 
for tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step  the company performs the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the company s estimates 
in future periods  changes in facts  circumstances  and new information may require the company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur 
as of september   the company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling million 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog as of september  decreased to  million compared to  million at september  the access equipment segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  as a result of weakening markets in europe and a weaker us economy in addition to the timing of orders that were placed in the prior year when there were capacity constraints in the industry 
the defense segment backlog decreased to  million at september  compared to  million at september  the company did not complete negotiations of its current fhtv contract with the dod until october   which negatively impacted the timing of orders from the dod 
fire emergency segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  due to strong order volume for domestic fire apparatus 
commercial segment backlog at september  was million  which was flat with september  backlog 
unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles was up domestically compared to september  as customers continued to update their fleets 
unit backlogs for front discharge and rear discharge concrete mixers were down and  respectively  compared to september  on continued weak construction markets in the us unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles was down in europe 
approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv  mtvr  id iq and lvsr contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
the company  as needed  uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements 
in january  the company entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk of interest rate changes associated with the company s variable rate debt issued to finance the acquisition of jlg 
the swap effectively fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement 
the notional amount of the swap at september  was billion and reduces in varying amounts annually each december until its termination on december  under the terms of the swap agreement  the notional amount of the swap will decline to billion in december the portion of the company s interest expense not effectively fixed in the interest rate swap remains sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its credit agreement 
a basis point increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt  including outstanding swaps  would result in a change in forecasted fiscal pre tax interest expense of approximately million 
these amounts are determined on an annual basis by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on average forecasted borrowings during fiscal  after consideration of the interest rate swap  but do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
expected maturity date september  thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt variable rate us average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed us average pay rate average receive rate commodity price risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm  fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
foreign currency risk the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  belgium  canada  the netherlands  italy  sweden  france  australia  germany  romania and the united kingdom and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities on six continents 
international sales were approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  including approximately that involved export sales from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the manufacture and sale of the company s products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of the company s transactions in foreign markets are denominated 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro and the uk pound sterling  changes between the us dollar and the australian dollar and changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
through the company s foreign currency hedging activities  the company seeks to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of the company s products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company enters into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the company s foreign currency exchange risk 
these contracts qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  however  the company has not designated all of these instruments as hedge transactions under sfas no 
accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings along with the offsetting foreign currency transaction gain loss recognized on the related balance sheet exposure 
at september   the company was managing million notional of foreign currency contracts  all of which were not designated as accounting hedges and all of which settle within days 
the following table quantifies outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge non us dollar denominated cash  receivables and payables and the corresponding impact on the value of these instruments assuming a appreciation depreciation of the us dollar relative to all other currencies on september  in millions foreign exchange gain loss from notional amount average contractual exchange rate fair value appreciation of us dollar depreciation of us dollar sell euro buy usd sell aud buy usd sell usd buy gbp sell ron buy usd sell gbp buy euro sell pln buy euro sell ron buy euro sell euro buy sek sell dkk buy sek as previously noted  the company s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes or the use of leveraged instruments 
it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables
