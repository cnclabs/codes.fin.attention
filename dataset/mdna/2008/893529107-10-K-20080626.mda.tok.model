overview operational overview 
we are a leading distributor of professional grade test and measurement instruments and provider of nationally recognized and accredited calibration  d metrology and repair services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our product segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement instruments 
additionally  because we specialize in test and measurement instruments  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to assist them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
sales in our product segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as industrial customers increase or curtail capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
the majority of our products are not consumables  but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
our strength in our service segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration and repair of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 
we believe our service segment offers an opportunity for long term growth and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers with regular calibration cycles 
we evaluate revenue growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  and not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
in evaluating our results for fiscal year  the following factors should be taken into account fiscal year and fiscal year operating results include weeks compared with weeks for fiscal year fiscal year net income includes a million reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we reversed the allowance after an evaluation of the status of our foreign tax credits and the likelihood that these credits would be utilized prior to their expiration 
fiscal year operating results included a million pre tax gain from the sale of transmation products group tpg  which had been deferred since fiscal net of income taxes  the impact of this previously deferred gain on fiscal year net income was approximately million 
net revenue for fiscal year was million  a increase compared with revenue of million for fiscal year product segment sales increased to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal year approximately of product segment sales in fiscal year were sold directly to end user customers while were to resellers compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we reduced promotional discounts to resellers in order to improve the gross margin of 
table of contents the product segment 
domestic sales comprised approximately of the total product segment sales in fiscal year  while were to canada and were to other international markets 
service segment revenue increased to million  or of total net revenue  in year fiscal for fiscal year  of service segment revenue was generated by our calibration centers of excellence and of service segment revenue was generated through subcontracted outside vendors  while fiscal year service segment revenue was and  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal year was  a basis point improvement compared with gross margin of in fiscal year  and was primarily impacted by higher margins on lower product sales to resellers and the increase in incremental margin on service segment revenue 
product segment gross margin was in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year  while service segment gross margin improved to in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year operating expenses were million  or of revenue  in fiscal year compared with million  or of revenue  in fiscal year operating income was million for fiscal year compared with million in fiscal year  which included the recognition of a previously deferred million pre tax gain on the sale of tpg 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting principles or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of our consolidated financial statements includes a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our most critical accounting policies follows use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of fixed assets  estimated lives of our master catalog  and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to revenues over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of revenues and or the historical rate of returns 
inventory 
inventory consists of products purchased for resale and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost by applying a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 

table of contents property and equipment  depreciation  and amortization 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements property and equipment determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we account for software costs in accordance with statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  using the fair market value measurement requirement  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach 
we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
the evaluation of our reporting units on a fair value basis indicated that no impairment existed as of march   march  and march  catalog costs 
we capitalize the cost of each master catalog mailed and amortize the cost over the respective catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total unamortized catalog costs in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of march  and march   respectively 
deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
see taxes below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
stock based compensation 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  we measure the cost of services received in exchange for all equity awards granted  including stock options  warrants and restricted stock  based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date 
we use the modified prospective application method to record compensation cost related to unvested stock awards as of march  by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards with no change in historical reported earnings 
awards granted after march  are valued at fair value and are recognized on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award 
excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock awards are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity 
excess tax benefits are realized benefits from tax deductions for exercised awards in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock based compensation costs for such awards 
we did not have any stock based compensation costs capitalized as part of an asset 
we estimate forfeiture rates based on our historical experience 
options generally vest ratably over a period of up to four years and expire up to ten years from the date of grant 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  options granted to executive officers vest using a graded schedule of in the first year  in each of the second and third years  and in the fourth year 
prior options granted to executive officers vested ratably over three years 
the expense relating to these 
table of contents executive officer options is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
prior to fiscal year  we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  using the intrinsic value method  which did not require that compensation cost be recognized for our stock awards provided the exercise price was equal to or greater than the common stock fair market value on the date of grant 
prior to fiscal year  we provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as if the fair value method had been applied to its stock based compensation 
our net income and net income per share for fiscal year would have been reduced if compensation cost related to stock awards had been recorded in the financial statements based on fair value at the grant dates 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
product sales are recorded when a product s title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or repair activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
we generally invoice our customers for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
our prices are fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and returns are reasonably estimated 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related revenues are recorded based upon historical data 
gain on tpg divestiture 
during the fiscal year ended march   we sold tpg 
as a result of certain post closing commitments  we deferred recognition of a million pre tax gain on the sale 
during fiscal year  we satisfied those commitments and consequently realized the gain as a component of operating income in our consolidated financial statements 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the tpg divestiture 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements

our product sales per business day for each fiscal quarter during fiscal years and  is as follows fy fy q q q q q q q q product sales per business day overall product sales from fiscal year to fiscal year reflect an year over year growth in our direct distribution channel 
this growth was a result of a combination of increased prices  new product introductions by strategic suppliers  increased customer response to our sales and marketing efforts and growing sales through our website 
our direct distribution channel gross profit percentage increased points as a result of reduced discounting 
for the same time period  our reseller channel experienced a increase in gross profit despite a sales decrease of 
sales within this channel are driven by volume based pricing for each reseller 
during fiscal year  we adjusted our channel pricing structure  which generated a point increase in gross profit percentage for our resellers and a point decline in reseller sales as a percent of total product sales

pending product shipments are primarily backorders  but also include products that are requested to be calibrated in our calibration laboratories prior to shipment  orders required to be shipped complete  and orders required to be shipped at a future date 
our total pending product shipments for fiscal year decreased by approximately million  or from fiscal year fiscal year year end backorders included a million remaining balance on a single large product order that was placed by a customer during our fiscal second quarter  but was shipped across multiple months based on an agreed upon delivery schedule with that customer

within the calibration industry  there is a broad array of measurement disciplines making it costly and inefficient for any one provider to invest the needed capital for facilities  equipment and uniquely trained personnel necessary to perform all calibrations in house 
our strategy has been to focus our investments in the core electrical  temperature  pressure and dimensional disciplines 
accordingly  in servicing our customers calibration needs  we have historically subcontracted to outside vendors  including those with unique or proprietary capabilities  to of the instruments we receive from customers for calibration

revised  business combinations sfas r 
this statement establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r also requires acquisition related transaction expenses and restructuring costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination 
sfas r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations beginning in our fiscal year ending march  sfas in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   our fiscal year ending march  in february  the fasb issued financial statement of position no 
 partial deferral of the effective date of statement fsp 
fsp delays the effective date of sfas  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
this statement applies to the accounting for noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas requires noncontrolling interests to be reported as a component of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
sfas becomes effective for us in the fiscal year ending march  since we do not currently have any noncontrolling interests  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents outlook our efforts to build our calibration services business and expand our margins have begun to show results 
we expect that as we continue to drive execution of our sales and marketing strategy we should see continued revenue growth and expansion of our profit margins on a year over year basis 
we anticipate mid to upper single digit growth of our product segment sales in the fiscal year ending march  fiscal year  which is reliant on successful new product introductions by our suppliers  while we expect service segment sales will grow by to 
as a result of the leverage gained on incremental revenue from calibration services  we expect operating income to grow at a faster rate than revenue 
our goal is to be the recognized leader in providing premium test and measurement instruments and quality calibration and related services to the life science  manufacturing  utility and process industries 
as these industries continue to require increased quality and control in their processes  we believe that the value and convenience we provide  our product application assistance and our exacting calibration standards will enable us to capture greater market share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by less than million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant 
on march  and march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates 
under our existing credit facility described in note of our consolidated financial statements  interest is adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon our calculated leverage ratio 
we mitigate our interest rate risk by electing the lower of the base rate available under the credit facility and the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of march   the base rate and the libor rate were and  respectively 
our interest rate for fiscal year ranged from to 
foreign currency approximately of our net revenues for fiscal years and were denominated in united states dollars  with the remainder denominated in canadian dollars 
a change in the value of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar would impact our net revenues by approximately 
we monitor the relationship between the united states and canadian currencies on a continuous basis and adjust sales prices for products and services sold in canadian dollars as we believe to be appropriate 
during the first half of fiscal year  we incurred foreign exchange losses of million due to the decrease in value of the united states dollar compared to the canadian dollar 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce any further risk that our earnings would be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the contracts were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we did not apply hedge accounting and therefore  the change in the fair value of the contracts  which totaled million  was recognized in current earnings as a component of other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the change in the fair value of the contracts was offset by the change in fair value on the underlying intercompany assets and liabilities being hedged 
on march  and march   there were no hedging arrangements outstanding 
we do not use hedging arrangements for speculative purposes
