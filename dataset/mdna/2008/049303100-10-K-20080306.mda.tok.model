item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  recent developments 
cash flows year ended december  compared to year ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operations is an important source of short term liquidity for us 
it is directly affected by changes in the price of natural gas and oil  interest rates and our ability to raise funds from our drilling investment partnerships 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in the year ended december  to million from million in the year ended december   substantially as a result of the following an increase in net income before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period  principally due to the contribution of our michigan operations acquired on june  and increases in net income from our partnership management operations and our appalachian production segment  a decrease in non cash items of million related to our compensation expense resulting from grants under long term incentive plans  non cash gains of derivatives and the impact of cumulative change in accounting principle  and changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by million in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily a result of the following a decrease of million in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and an increase of million in liabilities associated with our drilling contracts 
our level of liabilities associated with drilling contracts is dependent upon the remaining amount of our drilling obligations at any balance sheet date  which is dependent upon the timing and level of funds raised through our investment partnerships 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used in our investing activities increased billion in the year ended december  to billion from million in the year ended december  primarily from our billion acquisition of dte gas oil and a million increase in capital expenditures related to the increase in the number of wells we drilled in fiscal cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by our financing activities increased billion in the year ended december  to billion from cash used of  in the year ended december   principally as a result of the following to fund the acquisition of dte gas oil on june   we borrowed million on our credit facility  we borrowed additional funds on our credit facility  net of repayments of million  to fund our investments in our partnerships  net monies remitted to atlas america during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increased financing cash flows by million  in the year ended december   we distributed million to atlas america  net proceeds of from issuances of units increased million in the year ended december  as compared to december   deferred financing costs increased million in the year ended december  due to our new credit facility used to fund our acquisition of ago  and we paid million in distributions to our unit holders in the year ended december  three months ended december  cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the three months ended december   substantially as a result of the following net income before depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  principally as a result of higher natural gas prices and drilling profits  changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by million  primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and liabilities associated with our drilling contracts of million related to an increase in drilling activity 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash used by our investing activities was million  primarily as a result of capital expenditures related to wells we drilled 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash used in our financing activities was million primarily due to funds paid to our affiliate 
year ended september  cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended september  as a result of the following net income before depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  and changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by million in the year ended september   and relates primarily to million in liabilities associated with our drilling contracts 
cash flows used in investing activities 
net cash used in our investing activities was million in the year ended september  primarily related to capital expenditures we made in our investment partnerships 
cash flows used in financing activities 
net cash used in our financing activities was million primarily due to funds paid to our affiliate 
changes in prices and inflation our revenues  the value of our assets  our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms and our ability to finance our drilling activities through investment partnerships have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
during the years ended december  and  we received on average of and per mcf of natural gas and and per bbl of oil  respectively 
during the three months ended december   we received an average of per mcf of natural gas and per bbl of oil  respectively 
during the year ended september   we received an average of per mcf of natural gas and per bbl of oil 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation has not normally had a significant effect on us 
however  inflationary trends may occur if the price of natural gas were to increase since such an increase may increase the demand for acreage and for energy equipment and services  thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services 
environmental regulation to date  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we have complied with the spill prevention plan requirements on our operations  including pending changes by united states environmental protection agency to the federal regulations that required compliance by october  we cannot assure you that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations 
cash distributions we do not have a contractual obligation to make distributions to our unitholders 
we distribute our available cash  to our unitholders each quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash is defined in our operating agreement  and it generally means  for each fiscal quarter all cash on hand at the end of the quarter  less the amount of cash that our board of directors determines in its reasonable discretion is necessary or appropriate to provide for the proper conduct of our business including reserves for future capital expenditures and credit needs  comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments  or other agreements  or provide funds for distributions to our unitholders for any one more of the next four quarters or with respect to our management incentive interests  plus all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter 
working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under our credit facility and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to unitholders 
we seek to maintain a coverage ratio for our distributions of at least x on a rolling quarter basis 
our coverage ratio for the quarter ended december  was x 
we calculate our coverage ratio as the amount of all of our cash receipts less disbursements  including interest expense and estimated maintenance capital expenditures  divided by the amount of distributions to our unitholders 
all cash we distribute to unitholders will be characterized as either operating surplus or capital surplus  as defined in our limited liability company agreement and is subject to different distribution rules 
we will treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until the sum of all available cash distributed since we began operations equals the operating surplus as of the most recent date of determination of available cash 
we do not anticipate distributing any cash from capital surplus 
available cash is initially distributed to our common unit holders and to atlas energy management 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions any distribution paid to atlas energy management in excess of of the aggregate amount of cash being distributed to be paid to atlas energy management if quarterly distributions to the common unit holders exceed specified targets as defined in our limited liability company agreement 
on january   we declared our quarterly cash distribution for the fourth quarter of of per common unit 
the million distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record as of february  distributions made to atlas america for the year ended december  were million  representing the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt secured revolving credit facilities operating lease obligations capital lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligation total contractual cash obligations not included in the table above are estimated interest payments calculated at the rates in effect at december  of million  million  million  million and million 
payments due by period in thousands less than after other commercial commitments total year years years years standby letters of credit guarantees standby replacement commitments other commercial commitments total commercial commitments critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and cost and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the provision for possible losses  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
accounts receivable and allowance for possible losses through our business segments  we engage in credit extension  monitoring  and collection 
in evaluating our allowance for possible losses  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to many of our energy customers 
at december  and our credit evaluation indicated that we have no need for an allowance for possible losses for our oil and gas receivables 
derivative instruments we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas sfas requires each derivative instrument to be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
changes in a derivative instrument s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements 
reserve estimates our estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions  including those required by the sec  as to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves 
as a result  our estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay amounts due under our credit facilities or cause a reduction in our energy credit facilities 
in addition  our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history  results of future exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices  mechanical difficulties  governmental regulation and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
impairment of oil and gas properties we review our producing oil and gas properties for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying values 
we estimate the expected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
because of the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that will require us to record an impairment of our oil and gas properties 
any such impairment may affect or cause a reduction in our credit facilities 
asset retirement obligations as described in note to our combined and consolidated financial statements  we follow sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and on december   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of million in the year ended december  under sfas no 
 estimated asset retirement costs are recognized when the asset is placed in service  and are amortized using the units of production method 
on an annual basis  we review our estimates of the costs of future dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment of our natural gas and oil producing properties 
we also review our estimates of the salvage value of equipment recoverable upon abandonment 
as of december  and  our estimate of salvage values was greater than or equal to our estimate of the costs of future dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment 
a decrease in our salvage value or an increase in dismantlement  restoration  reclamation and abandonment costs from those we have estimated could reduce our gross profit from operations 
inherent in the fair value calculation of asset retirement obligations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the estimated remaining lives of the wells  the estimated cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates and changes in the legal regulatory requirements 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of our existing asset retirement obligation  a corresponding adjustment is made to our oil and gas properties 
goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but instead are assessed for impairment annually 
we have recorded goodwill of million in connection with several acquisitions of assets 
in assessing impairment of goodwill  we use estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of reporting units 
if under these estimates and assumptions we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced  the reduction can result in an impairment of goodwill 
however  future results could differ from the estimates and assumptions we use 
events or circumstances which might lead to an indication of impairment of goodwill would include  but might not be limited to  prolonged decreases in expectations of long term well servicing and or drilling activity or rates brought about by prolonged decreases in natural gas or oil prices  changes in government regulation of the natural gas and oil industry or other events which could affect the level of activity of exploration and production companies 
in assessing impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill  where there has been a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  we have estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from the use of the asset based on actual historical results and expectations about future economic circumstances  including natural gas and oil prices and operating costs 
our estimate of future net cash flows from the use of an asset could change if actual prices and costs differ due to industry conditions or other factors affecting our performance 
revenue recognition we conduct certain activities through  and a portion of our revenues are attributable to  our investment partnerships 
these investment partnerships raise capital from investors to drill gas and oil wells 
we serve as the managing general partner of the investment partnerships and assume customary rights and obligations for them 
as a general partner  we are liable for partnership liabilities and can be liable to limited partners if we breach our responsibilities with respect to the operations of the partnerships 
the income from our general partner interest is recorded when the gas and oil are sold by a partnership 
we contract with the investment partnerships to drill partnership wells 
the contracts require that the investment partnerships must pay us the full contract price upon execution 
the income from a drilling contract is recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method 
the contracts are typically completed in less than days 
we classify the difference between the contract payments we have received and the revenue earned as a current liability  included in liabilities associated with drilling contracts 
we recognize gathering revenues at the time the natural gas is delivered to the purchaser 
we recognize well services revenues at the time the services are performed 
we are entitled to receive administration and oversight fees according to the respective partnership agreements 
we recognize such fees as income when earned 
we generally sell natural gas and crude oil at prevailing market prices 
revenue is recognized when produced quantities are delivered to a custody transfer point  persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery  collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
revenues from the production of natural gas and crude oil in which we have an interest with other producers is recognized on the basis of our percentage ownership of working interest or overriding royalty 
generally  our sales contracts are based on pricing provisions that are tied to a market index  with certain adjustments based on proximity to gathering and transmission lines and the quality of our natural gas 
income taxes we are a limited liability company and have elected to be treated as a partnership for income tax purposes 
as a result  we are not subject to us federal and most state income taxes 
our unitholders are liable for income taxes on their distributive share of our taxable income 
such taxable income may vary substantially from net income reported in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements 
certain of our corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal and state income tax 
the federal and state income taxes related to us and these corporate subsidiaries were immaterial to the combined and consolidated financial statements and are recorded in pre tax income on a current basis only 
accordingly  no federal or state deferred income tax has been provided for in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
fin requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions have met a more likely than not threshold of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax benefits related to tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are not permitted to be recognized in the financial statements 
the provisions of fin were adopted by us effective january  implementation of fin had no impact on our combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  our policy is to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense  when and if they become applicable 
we file income tax returns in the us federal and various state jurisdictions 
with limited exceptions  we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by major tax authorities for years before recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  or sfas this statement amends accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no r  business combinations  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  however  it retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  be measured at their fair values as of that date  with specified limited exceptions 
changes subsequent to that date are to be recognized in earnings  not goodwill 
additionally  sfas no 
r requires costs incurred in connection with an acquisition be expensed as incurred 
restructuring costs  if any  are to be recognized separately from the acquisition 
the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages must also recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as the noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
sfas no 
r is effective for business combinations occurring in fiscal years beginning on or after december  we will apply the requirements of sfas no 
r upon its adoption on january  and are currently evaluating whether sfas no 
r will have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 application of the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  to master limited partnerships  or eitf no 
 an update of eitf no 
eitf no 
requires the calculation of a master limited partnership s mlps net earnings per limited partner unit for each period presented according to distributions declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all of the earnings for that period had been distributed 
in periods with undistributed earnings above specified levels  the calculation per the two class method results in an increased allocation of such undistributed earnings to the general partner and a dilution of earnings to the limited partners 
eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the application of eitf is not expected to have an effect on our earnings per unit calculation 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
 or fsp fin  which refers to fasb interpretation no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts or fin fsp fin amends fin  which allows an entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement 
fsp fin was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of fsp fin to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the statement will be effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  the statement offers various options in electing to apply the provisions of this statement  and at this time we have not made any decisions in its application to us 
we do not expect the adoption of fasb to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurement  or sfas sfas addresses the need for increased consistency in fair value measurements  defining fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements 
in february  the fasb issued final fasb staff position  or fsp no 
fas the fsp  which was effective upon issuance  delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value at least once a year  to fiscal years beginning after november  the fsp also covers interim periods within the fiscal years for items within its scope 
the delay is intended to allow the fasb and its constituents the time to consider the various implementation issues associated with sfas we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general we are exposed to various market risks  principally fluctuating interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
these risks can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts and swap agreements 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows and financial position as if hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred on december  only the potential impacts of hypothetical assumptions are analyzed 
the analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we have a revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing base of million  of which million was outstanding including million in letters of credit 
the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under this credit facility was at december  new interest rate swap in january  we entered into an interest rate swap contract for million  swapping the floating rate incurred on a portion of our existing senior secured credit facility for a fixed rate of approximately  which includes an initial margin of over the three year fixed swap rate of 
the interest rate swap contract will mature in january combining the interest rate on the new swap and the interest rate on the new senior notes  we have fixed million of our outstanding debt at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
with the subsequent changes in our debt structure above  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate would change our net income by approximately million 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure in commodities is fluctuations in the pricing of our gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to united states natural gas production 
pricing for gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
to limit our exposure to changing natural gas prices  we enter into natural gas  costless collar  and option contracts 
at any point in time  such contracts may include regulated nymex futures and options contracts and non regulated over the counter futures contracts with qualified counterparties 
nymex contracts are generally settled with offsetting positions  but may be settled by the delivery of natural gas 
our risk management objective is to lock in a range of pricing for expected production volumes 
considering those volumes for which we have entered into financial hedge agreements for the year ending december   and current indices  a theoretical upward or downward change in the price of natural gas would result in a change in net income of approximately million 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and the items being hedged  including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transactions 
this includes matching the natural gas futures and options contracts to the forecasted transactions 
we assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of hedged items 
historically these contracts have qualified and been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  and are recorded at their fair values 
gains or losses on future contracts are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally prices on nymex 
changes in fair value are recognized in combined equity and recognized within the combined statements of income in the month the hedged commodity is sold 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  due to the loss of correlation between changes in reference prices underlying a hedging instrument and actual commodity prices  we will discontinue hedge accounting for the derivative and subsequent changes in fair value for the derivative will be recognized immediately into earnings 
as of december   we had financial hedges in place for approximately of our expected production volumes for the year ending december  at december   we had open natural gas futures contracts related to natural gas sales covering million mmbtus of natural gas  which includes million mmbtus covering natural gas production assets acquired from ago  maturing through december  at an average settlement price of per mmbtu 
on may   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire ago see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the financing of this transaction  we agreed as a condition precedent to closing that we would hedge of our projected natural gas volumes for no less than three years from the closing date of the transaction 
during may  we entered into derivative instruments to hedge of the projected production of the assets to be acquired as required under the financing agreement 
the production volume of the assets to be acquired was not considered to be probable forecasted production under sfas no 
at the date these derivatives were entered into because the acquisition of the assets had not yet been completed 
accordingly  we recognized the instruments as non qualifying for hedge accounting at inception with subsequent changes in the derivative value recorded within revenues in our combined and consolidated statements of income 
we recognized non cash income of million related to the change in value of these derivatives from may  to june   which is shown as gain on mark to market derivatives in the combined and consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and upon closing of the acquisition on june   the production volumes of the assets acquired were considered probable forecasted production under sfas no 
and we evaluated these derivatives under the cash flow hedge criteria in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  we recognized gains on settled contracts covering natural gas production of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as the underlying prices and terms in our hedge contracts were consistent with the indices used to sell our natural gas  there were no gains or losses recognized during the years ended december  and  respectively for hedge ineffectiveness or as a result of the discontinuance of these cash flow hedges 
we did not enter into any hedging contracts in the three months ended december  or year ended september  of the million net loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss at december   we will reclassify million of gains to our consolidated statements of income over the next twelve month period as these contracts expire and million of losses will be reclassified in later periods if the fair values of the instruments remain at current market values 
of the million net unrealized hedge asset at december   our portion is million  and million of unrealized hedge losses have been reallocated to our investment partnerships 
as of december   we had the following natural gas volumes hedged fixed price swaps twelve month average fair value period ending volumes fixed price asset liability december  mmbtu per mmbtu in thousands costless collars twelve month average fair value period ending volumes floor and cap asset liability december  option type mmbtu per mmbtu in thousands puts purchased calls sold puts purchased calls sold puts purchased calls sold puts purchased calls sold total net asset fair value based on forward nymex natural gas prices
