item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank holding companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we often rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the ability of the company to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although management has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review during the loan application process and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to recent downturns and disruptions in several downturns and disruptions occurred in markets which are important to our businesses  and similar or additional adverse events may occur in the future 
although those events did not create new types of risks  we believe it is useful to highlight some of the key impacts of those events on our business to illustrate how events beyond our control can adversely affect us 
some of the significant recent downturns and disruptions relevant to mortgage and related businesses include residential housing values in the us have stagnated or fallen  and in some highly populated markets values have fallen significantly  the volume of residential housing transactions also has stagnated or fallen  and in some markets volume has fallen significantly  investor demand for mortgage backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply  and for some categories of mortgages disappeared almost entirely  except for conforming loans  which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities  rates for some types of home mortgage products have risen sharply and some mortgage products  with new and more restrictive credit criteria  have become difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates  making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage  many mortgage borrowers in recent years have obtained adjustable rate products  and it is possible that many will adjust to higher rates  and therefore higher payments  in the near future  fear has been expressed by some public officials and others that mortgage related defaults  foreclosures  and personal bankruptcies have risen and will rise significantly in the future  the us congress and other governmental bodies have considered  and in the future may enact or adopt  new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms of outstanding mortgage loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense of lenders  restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans  and increase the regulatory burdens and legal risks on mortgage lenders and servicers  and the federal reserve has acted recently to lower certain short term interest rates  possibly to help ameliorate the impacts of the disruptions in housing and the mortgage industry  which has triggered reductions in the prime lending rates charged by most us banks 
some of the significant actual and potential impacts of those events on one or more of our businesses include pressures on our liquidity in the mortgage business as investor demand shrank and the securitization markets diminished or  for some products  disappeared  significant reduction in our ability to create gains on sale of mortgage loans we originate  significant reduction in mortgage origination volume and fees  significant increase in delinquencies in some loan products and markets which are related to mortgages and housing  significant increase in loan loss provision for loans secured by  or directly related to  mortgages and the housing industry  significant increase in costs of servicing mortgages due to increased credit remediation and loss mitigation activity  as well as increased collection and foreclosure activity  the possibility that falling us prime rates in could compress our net interest margin  and the possibility that  in  adjustable rate heloc loans that are tied to falling us prime rates could be drawn more fully and could be pre paid less often so that  in conjunction with falling housing values  the ratio of heloc loan balances to current actual values may weaken which could  in turn  translate into higher loan losses and higher provisioning for future losses within the heloc portfolio 
the profitability of the company depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of mississippi 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of mississippi and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in east central mississippi 
the local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services  as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
the earnings of bank holding companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
in addition to the risks associated with the general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  our operations and profitability are also impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  which are all beyond our control 
a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non performing assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the information under the heading competition in item  business  provides more information regarding the competitive conditions in our markets 
our industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than us  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the company s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
the company and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  and not the economic or other interests of shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of the foregoing  could affect the company or the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  the company and the bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
if we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework could affect the confidence of our customers in us  thus compromising our competitive position 
in addition  failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework or well managed under regulatory examination procedures could compromise our status as a bank holding company and related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals 
we are also subject to laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes act and sec regulations 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could also result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and or civil money penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
