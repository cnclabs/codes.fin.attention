item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and selected financial data included elsewhere in this filing 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including the risks discussed in risk factors in this filing 
overview we mine  process and sell bituminous  steam and industrial grade coal through six operating subsidiaries mining complexes located throughout eastern kentucky and in southern indiana 
we have two reportable business segments based on the coal basins in which we operate central appalachia capp and the midwest midwest 
in  our mines produced million tons of coal including  tons of contract coal and we purchased another  tons for resale 
of the million tons we produced from company operated mines  approximately came from underground mines  while the remaining came from surface mines 
in  we generated revenues of million and a net loss of million 
capp segment in central appalachia  the majority of our coal is primarily sold to customers in the southern portion of the south atlantic region of the united states 
the south atlantic region includes the states of florida  georgia  south carolina  north carolina  west virginia  virginia  maryland and delaware 
according to the most recent information available from the us energy information administration eia  in the south atlantic region consumed about of all coal for electric generation in the united states 
the south atlantic region had a decrease in coal consumption in the electric power sector of in we have been providing coal to customers in the south atlantic region since our formation in in  georgia power company and south carolina public service authority were our largest customers  representing approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
according to the eia  in coal production increased in the appalachia region by 
production increases in the appalachia region were impacted by transportation problems  rising operating costs and difficulty in permitting new mines 
during  our capp segment shipped million tons of coal 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
based on our most recent analysis prepared by marshall miller associates  inc mm a as of march   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and an average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support approximately years of production 
our capp segment continued to experience upward pressure on mining costs during our costs have been negatively impacted by recent governmental regulations that have impacted productivity and by commodity based variable mining costs 
we are focused on reducing our operating costs at each mine and improving miner productivity 
we continue to select projects for capital expenditures for equipment  facilities  and infrastructure that we believe will provide high returns 
we also continue to focus our training programs to help our personnel be safer and more productive 
midwest segment in the midwest  the majority of our coal is sold in the east north central region  which includes the states of illinois  indiana  ohio  michigan and wisconsin 
according to the eia  in the east north central region consumed about of all coal consumed for electric generation in the united states 
the east north central region had a decrease in coal consumption for the electric power sector of in in  our midwest segment s largest customer represented approximately of our total revenues 
during  our midwest segment shipped million tons of coal 
we believe that coal fired electric utilities value the high energy coal that comprises the majority of our midwest reserves 
as of december   we estimate that we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
based on our most recent analyses prepared by mm a as of february  and april   we estimate that these reserves have an average heat content of  btu per pound and average sulfur content of 
at current production levels  we believe these reserves would support approximately years of production 
reserves mm a prepared a detailed study of our capp reserves as of march  based on all of our geologic information  including our updated drilling and mining data 
mm a completed their report on our capp reserves in june for the triad properties  mm a also prepared a detailed study of triad s reserves as of february  for the reserves obtained in the acquisition of triad and as of april  for certain additional reserves acquired in the second quarter of the mm a studies were planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance of the subject demonstrated reserves 
in connection with the studies  mm a prepared reserve maps and had certified professional geologists develop estimates based on data supplied by us and triad using standards accepted by government and industry 
we have used mm a s march  study as the basis for our current internal estimate of our central appalachia reserves and mm a s february  and april  studies as the basis for our current internal estimate of our midwest reserves 
reserves for these purposes are defined by sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the reserve estimates were prepared using industry standard methodology to provide reasonable assurance that the reserves are recoverable  considering technical  economic and legal limitations 
although mm a has reviewed our reserves and found them to be reasonable notwithstanding unforeseen geological  market  labor or regulatory issues that may affect the operations  mm a s engagement did not include performing an economic feasibility study for our reserves 
in accordance with standard industry practice  we have performed our own economic feasibility analysis for our reserves 
it is not generally considered to be practical  however  nor is it standard industry practice  to perform a feasibility study for a company s entire reserve portfolio 
in addition  mm a did not independently verify our control of our properties  and has relied solely on property information supplied by us 
reserve acreage  average seam thickness  average seam density and average mine and wash recovery percentages were verified by mm a to prepare a reserve tonnage estimate for each reserve 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves as discussed in critical accounting estimates coal reserves 
based on the mm a reserve studies and the foregoing assumptions and qualifications  and after giving effect to our operations from the respective dates of the studies through december   we estimate that  as of december   we controlled approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in the capp region and millions tons in the midwest region 
the following table provides additional information regarding changes to our reserves since december  in millions of tons capp midwest total proven and probable reserves  as of december  coal extracted acquisitions adjustments divestures proven and probable reserves  as of december  calculated in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
proven reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings  or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspections  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves have a moderate degree of geologic assurance and are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
this reserve information reflects recoverable tonnage on an as received basis with moisture 
represents estimated reserves on properties acquired during the relevant period 
we calculated the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above 
represents changes in reserves due to additional information obtained from exploration activities  production activities or discovery of new geologic information 
we calculated the adjustments to the reserves in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
represents changes in reserves due to expired leases 
key performance indicators we manage our business through several key performance metrics that provide a summary of information in the areas of sales  operations  and general and administrative costs 
in the sales area  our long term metrics are the volume weighted average remaining term of our contracts and our open contract position for the next several years 
during periods of high prices  we may seek to lengthen the average remaining term of our contracts and reduce the open tonnage for future periods 
in the short term  we closely monitor the average selling price per ton asp  and the mix between our spot sales and contract sales 
in the operations area  we monitor the volume of coal that is produced by each of our principal sources  including company mines  contract mines  and purchased coal sources 
for our company mines  we focus on both operating costs and operating productivity 
we closely monitor the cost per ton of our mines against our budgeted costs and against our other mines 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are also measures used by management to measure operating performance 
we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense net  income tax expense benefit and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
we regularly use ebitda to evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and is not an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of operating liquidity 
adjusted ebitda is used in calculating compliance with our debt covenants and adjusts ebitda for certain items as defined in our debt agreements  including stock compensation and certain bank fees 
in the selling  general and administrative area  we closely monitor the gross dollars spent per mine operation and in support functions 
we also regularly measure our performance against our internally prepared budgets 
trends in our business recently  demand has increased for coal which has led to a rise in coal prices 
this increase in demand and prices has been driven primarily by an increase in coal exports driven by low worldwide coal inventory 
we believe that the increase in coal prices will result in increased production as it will become economical to operate higher cost coal mines 
we believe that the demand for coal worldwide will continue to be strong and help to offset future increases in production 
in the long term  we believe that the market for coal in the united states remains strong as coal continues to be one of the most economical energy sources 
a number of factors beyond our control impact coal prices  including the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity  the demand for steel and the continued financial viability of the domestic and foreign steel industries  the cost of transporting coal to the customer  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  air emission standards for coal fired power plants  and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation 
as discussed previously  our costs of production have increased in recent years 
we expect the higher costs to continue for the next several years  due to a number of factors  including increased governmental regulations  high prices in worldwide commodity markets and a highly competitive market for a limited supply of skilled mining personnel 
our business is very sensitive to changes in supply and demand for coal and we intend to carefully manage our mines in to maximize operating results 
events beyond our control could impact our profit margins 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the following table shows selected operating results for and in thousands  except per ton amounts year ended december  change total per ton total per ton total volume shipped tons coal sales synfuel handling cost of coal sold gain on curtailment of pension plan  n a depreciation  depletion and amortization gross profit loss selling  general and administrative volume and revenues by segment year ended december  capp midwest capp midwest volume shipped tons coal sales revenue average sales price per ton in  we shipped million tons of coal compared to million tons in coal sales revenue decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to a decrease in both tons sold and the average sales price per ton in capp 
the decrease in tons sold in capp was due to weak market conditions for coal 
in  the capp region sold million tons of coal of total capp sales volume under long term contracts at an average selling price of per ton

variable costs increased by per ton  primarily due to an increase in equipment rental at our surface mines  and an increase in fuel costs due to an increase in surface mining production in as compared to the remaining increase in the capp region was primarily due to an increase in costs at our preparation and load out facilities due to a decrease in tons processed by those facilities due to the impact on production of continuing regulatory scrutiny that began in our cost per ton of coal sold in the midwest region increased from in to in the increase in cost per ton of coal sold was primarily due to a per ton increase in labor costs due to an increase in wages and an increase in headcount  a increase in variable costs and in royalty costs 
this increase in the midwest was offset by a decrease in trucking costs of per ton due to certain customers assuming responsibility for trucking costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company also recorded a million charge in the capp region to write off of a prepaid royalty in connection with the restructuring of a mineral lease contract 
gain on curtailment of pension plan effective september   the company froze pension plan benefit accruals for all employees covered under its non contributory defined benefit pension plan  resulting in a curtailment gain of million in depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased from million in to million in in the capp region  depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million to million or per ton 
this decrease was primarily due to a drop in the depreciable assets base due to certain assets that became fully depreciated in may in the midwest  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million or per ton 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in certain salary and benefit amounts  property taxes and bank service charges 
a million expense for the resolution of a contingent obligation dealing with our previous bankruptcy was recorded in the fourth quarter of charges associated with repayment of debt in  we wrote off million of financing charges in connection with the repayment of the prior senior secured credit facility 
the write off of the financing charges is classified as charges associated with repayment of debt 
income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate is impacted primarily by the amount of the valuation allowance recorded and percentage depletion 
we recorded an million valuation allowance for tax purposes for the year ended december   which reduced our effective tax rate for by 
percentage depletion is an income tax deduction that is limited to a percentage of taxable income from each of our mining properties 
because percentage depletion can be deducted in excess of the cost basis of the property  it creates a permanent difference and directly impacts the effective tax rate 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate may occur between fiscal periods due to the varying levels of profitability and thus  taxable income and percentage depletion at each of our mine locations

in  the capp region sold approximately million tons of total capp sales volume to the spot market at an average selling price of per ton 
in  the capp region sold million tons of coal of total capp sales volume to the spot market at an average selling price of per ton 
the increase in the midwest was primarily due to a full year of shipments in versus seven months of shipments in the midwest revenues were primarily from sales under long term contracts 
the average sales price per ton in the midwest increased from in to in year ended december  capp midwest corporate capp midwest corporate cost of coal sold per ton depreciation  depletion  and amortization per ton cost of coal sold the cost of coal sold  excluding depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from million in to million in our cost per ton of coal sold in the capp region increased from per ton in the period to per ton in the period 
this increase in cost per ton of coal sold was due to several factors 
labor and benefit costs increased by per ton in primarily due to increase in benefits  necessitated by a competitive job market in the coal industry 
variable costs increased by per ton  primarily due to an increase in raw materials and maintenance and repair parts and the impact of increased regulatory scrutiny in which has impacted both our productivity and our overall mining costs 
cost per ton of coal sold in the midwest region increased from in to in this per ton increase was primarily due an increase in variable costs per ton  including an increase in raw materials costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company also recorded a million charge in the capp region to write off of a prepaid royalty in connection with the restructuring of a mineral lease contract 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization  increased from million in to million in in the capp region  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million to million or per ton  in this increase was due to capital expenditures which increased the depreciable asset base 
in the midwest  depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  or per ton 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for the increase was primarily due to a million expense for the resolution of a contingent obligation dealing with our previous bankruptcy recorded as a result of congressional action on the coal act in the fourth quarter of  an increase in bank charges of million  million increase in salary and benefits primarily attributed to an increase in headcount and a million increase in stock compensation 
income taxes our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate is impacted by percentage depletion 
percentage depletion is an income tax deduction that is limited to a percentage of taxable income from each of our mining properties 
because percentage depletion can be deducted in excess of the cost basis of the property  it creates a permanent difference and directly impacts the effective tax rate 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate may occur due to the varying levels of profitability and thus  taxable income and percentage depletion at each of our mine locations 
liquidity and capital resources as december   our outstanding long term debt consists of million of senior notes due on june  the senior notes and amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities discussed below 
the senior notes are unsecured and accrue interest at per annum 
interest payments on the senior notes are required semi annually 
we may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after june  at redemption prices from in to in in addition  at any time prior to june   we may redeem up to of the principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of a public equity offering at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the senior notes limit our ability  among other things  to pay cash dividends 
in addition  if a change of control occurs as defined in the indenture  each holder of the senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a part of the senior notes at a price equal to of their principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
on february   we entered into a million revolving credit agreement the revolver and a million term credit agreement collectively the facilities 
the term credit agreement consists of a million term facility the term facility and a million letter of credit facility the letter of credit facility 
a portion of the proceeds from the facilities were used to repay the prior revolver and prior letter of credit facilities and to pay fees and expenses associated with the facilities 
the remaining proceeds are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the letter of credit facility does not constitute a loan to us and accordingly is not available for borrowing by us 
the letter of credit facility supports the issuance of up to million of letters of credit 
we entered into an amendment and waiver to the senior secured credit facility on august  the credit amendment 
the credit amendment waived defaults under the facilities as of june   modified certain existing financial covenants in the facilities and added a minimum liquidity threshold 
the credit amendment also increased the interest rates on the facilities by  prohibits prepayments of the term loan for a period of one year and exempts up to million of cash proceeds from an equity offering from mandatory prepayment requirements 
the following is a summary of significant terms of the facilities  as amended 
revolver term facility letter of credit facility maturity february february february interest usage rate our option of base rate a plus or libor plus per annum our option of base rate a plus or libor plus per annum per annum maximum availability lesser of million and the borrowing base b million outstanding as of december  million periodic principal payments none  is due quarterly not applicable a base rate is the higher of the federal fund rate plus and the prime rate 
b the revolver s borrowing base is the sum of up to of the eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of up to of eligible inventory and up to of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory  minus reserves from time to time set by the administrative agent 
amount available is also subject to a minimum liquidity covenant 
the revolver provides that we can use up to million of the revolver availability to issue letters of credit 
the revolver provides for a fee on any outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolver and a fee on the unused portion of the revolver 
the facilities require certain mandatory prepayments from certain asset sales  incurrence of indebtedness and excess cash flow 
the facilities include financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum adjusted ebitda  a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity threshold and limit capital expenditures  each as defined by the agreement 
we were not in compliance with the minimum ebitda and leverage ratio covenants required by our facilities as of june  the credit amendment in august waived these defaults as of june   modified the existing financial covenants  added a minimum liquidity threshold and made other changes to the facilities 
as a result of the credit amendment  we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the facilities as of december  for more detail regarding the covenants under the facilities  see part ii item a risk factors we may be unable to comply with restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness  which could result in a default under these instruments 
the facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the following chart reflects the components of our debt as of december  and senior notes term facility prior senior secured credit facility revolver total long term debt less amounts classified as current total long term debt  less current maturities during the fourth quarter of  we raised approximately million through the issuance of common shares 
we used a portion of the proceeds to pay down the balance of the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the facilities that were entered into in february  as they were amended in august  and the sale of common stock in december  we expect to have adequate liquidity to operate our business throughout at december   we had available liquidity of million 
this available liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under the revolver after giving consideration to the million minimum liquidity requirement on december  effective  january   the minimum liquidity requirement will be million which on a proforma basis would have increased our availability under the revolver to million at december  the minimum liquidity threshold will be million on march   and will be million for the remainder of the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the facilities and the senior notes as of december   although we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance in subsequent periods 
if necessary  we will consider the issuance of equity  the sale of assets  seeking an additional waiver or other alternatives to remain in compliance with the covenants 
our primary source of cash is expected to be sales of coal to our utility and industrial customers 
the price of coal received can change dramatically based on supply and demand and will directly affect this source of cash 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of ordinary mining expenses to mine coal  capital expenditures and benefit payments 
ordinary mining expenses are driven by the cost of supplies  including steel prices and diesel fuel 
benefit payments include payments for workers compensation and black lung benefits paid over the lives of our employees as the claims are submitted 
we are required to pay these when due  and are not required to set aside cash for these payments 
we have posted surety bonds with state regulatory departments to guarantee these payments and have issued letters of credit to secure these bonds 
we believe that our letter of credit facility provides us with the ability to meet the necessary bonding requirements 
our secondary source of cash is the revolver 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from our operating activities  and availability under the revolver will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  to fund our capital expenditures for existing operations and to meet our debt service obligations through the remainder of nevertheless  there are many factors beyond our control  including general economic  regulatory and coal market conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our liquidity needs 
we believe that cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and future debt and equity offerings will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments for the next several years 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt service obligations  or fund planned capital expenditures  will substantially depend upon our future operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry  debt covenants  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in the event that the sources of cash described above are not sufficient to meet our future cash requirements  we will need to reduce certain planned expenditures  seek additional financing  or both 
we may seek to raise funds through additional debt financing or the issuance of additional equity securities 
if such actions are not sufficient  we may need to limit our growth  sell assets or reduce or curtail some of our operations to levels consistent with the constraints imposed by our available cash flow  or both 
our ability to seek additional debt or equity financing may be limited by our existing and any future financing arrangements  economic and financial conditions  or both 
in particular  our senior notes and the facilities restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
we cannot provide assurance that any reductions in our planned expenditures or in our expansion would be sufficient to cover shortfalls in available cash or that additional debt or equity financing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
currently  our primary use of cash during the next several years is expected to be ordinary course of business expenses and capital expenditures for existing mines 
we currently project that our capital expenditures for will be approximately to million 
we expect that such expenditures will be funded through cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowings under our debt facilities 
net cash provided by or used in operating activities reflects net income or loss adjusted for non cash charges and changes in net working capital including non current operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   our net income  as adjusted for non cash charges  was increased by a million increase in cash from our operating assets and liabilities 
the primarily changes in our operating assets and liabilities were a million decrease in our accounts receivables and an increase in accounts payables of million 
these changes are primarily due to timing of payments as compared with the prior year 
net cash used by investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we had a decrease in capital expenditures of million to million as compared to prior year 
the capital expenditures were primarily related to new and replacement mine equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects changes in short and long term financing 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we received million of proceeds from the entrance into our term facility and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
during  the cash inflows from financing activities were offset by million of repayments on our various debt facilities and million of debt issuance costs 
during  our primary financing activities were million of borrowings on the prior revolver 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt and fees under our letter of credit facility operating lease obligations royalty obligations purchase obligations consists of our senior notes and term loan 
we had no amounts outstanding under our revolver as of december  consists of interest payments on our senior notes and our term loan 
also includes the charge associated with our letter of credit facility 
we have assumed the interest rate on our term loan is the rate in place at december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on leases 
royalty obligations include minimum royalties payable on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of ten years 
certain coal leases require payment based on minimum tonnage  for these contracts an average sales price of was used to project the future commitment 
purchase obligations  if any  include agreements to purchase coal that include fixed quantities or minimum amounts and a fixed price provision 
they do not include agreements to purchase coal with vendors that do not include quantities or minimum tonnages  or monthly purchase orders 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension  workers compensation  black lung  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flow  results of operations or financial condition from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation and other miscellaneous obligations 
at december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds with third parties 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment  collection bonds  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
recently  surety bond costs have increased and the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
we also use bank letters of credit to secure our obligations for workers compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding 
the letters of credits were issued under our letter of credit facility 
critical accounting estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
us gaap require estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the estimates and judgments we make in connection with our consolidated financial statements are based on historical experience and various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements lists and describes our significant accounting policies 
the following critical accounting policies have a material effect on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
workers compensation we are liable under various state statutes for providing workers compensation benefits 
to fulfill these obligations  we have used self insurance programs with varying excess insurance levels  and  since june   a high deductible  fully insured program 
the high deductible  fully insured program is comparable to a self insured program where the excess insurance threshold equals the deductible level 
in june of  we became self insured for workers compensation for our kentucky operations 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our workers compensation obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if the estimates do not materialize as anticipated  our actual costs and cash expenditures could differ materially from that currently estimated 
our estimated workers compensation liability as of december  was million coal miners pneumoconiosis we are required under the federal mine safety and health act of  as amended  as well as various state statutes  to provide pneumoconiosis black lung benefits to eligible current and former employees and their dependents 
we provide these benefits through self insurance programs and  for those claims incurred with last exposure after june   a high deductible  fully insured program 
an independent actuary calculates the estimated pneumoconiosis liability annually based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the discount rate is based on interest rates on high quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flows 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was at december  significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our black lung obligation would increase by approximately million 
a change in the law  through either legislation or judicial action  could cause these assumptions to change 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  the actual costs and cash expenditures could vary materially from the amount currently estimated 
our estimated pneumoconiosis liability as of december  was million 
defined benefit pension effective september   the company froze it pension plan benefit accruals for all employees covered under its non contributory defined benefit pension plan  resulting in a curtailment gain of million 
as of december   the company valued the pension obligation to reflect the impact of the curtailment 
the estimated cost and benefits of our non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined annually by independent actuaries  who  with our review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
at december   the discount rate used to determine the obligation was 
significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our consolidated financial statements 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate from to  all other things being equal  the present value of our projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense was for the period ended december  significant changes to these rates would introduce volatility to our pension expense 
our accrued pension obligation as of december  was million 
reclamation and mine closure obligation the surface mining control reclamation act of establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining 
the company s asset retirement obligation liabilities consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming surface land and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering estimates related to these requirements 
us gaap require that asset retirement obligations be initially recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
our management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate is based on interest rates of bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
the actual costs could be different due to several reasons  including the possibility that our estimates could be incorrect  in which case our liabilities would differ 
if we perform the reclamation work using our personnel rather than hiring a third party  as assumed under us gaap  then the costs should be lower 
if governmental regulations change  then the costs of reclamation will be impacted 
us gaap recognize that the recorded liability could be different than the final cost of the reclamation and addresses the settlement of the liability 
when the obligation is settled  and there is a difference between the recorded liability and the amount paid to settle the obligation  a gain or loss upon settlement is included in earnings 
our asset retirement obligation as of december  was million 
contingencies we are the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
we have accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
unless otherwise noted  management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes statement no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
statement no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income 
we have also considered tax planning strategies in determining the deferred tax asset that will ultimately be realized 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of the amount of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
as of december  the company has reduced its deferred tax assets by an million valuation allowance based on the conclusion that not all of the gross deferred tax assets recorded as of december  will more likely than not be realized 
coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data initially assembled by our staff and analyzed by marshall miller associates  inc mm a 
the reserve information has subsequently been updated by our staff 
the updates to the reserves have been calculated in the same manner  and based on the same assumptions and qualifications  as used in the mm a studies described above  but these updates to the reserve estimates have not been reviewed by mm a 
a number of sources of information were used to determine accurate recoverable reserves estimates  including all currently available data  our own operational experience and that of our consultants  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  previously completed geological and reserve studies  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs 
reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect  among other factors mining activities  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings  and modification of mining plans or mining methods 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances could be material 
in particular  a variance in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our annual expense for depreciation  depletion and amortization and on our annual calculation for potential impairment

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin as of january   and have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin in addition  we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin other supplemental information sales commitments as of february   we had the following contractual commitments including long term and short term contracts to ship coal at a fixed and known price average price per ton tons s average price per ton tons s average price per ton tons s capp midwest a a certain contracts in the midwest include a customer option to increase or decrease the stated tons in the contract 
we have included option tons that we believe will be exercised based on current market prices 
the prices for the midwest in years to are minimum base price amounts adjusted for projected fuel escalators 
reconciliation of non gaap measures ebitda is a measure used by management to measure operating performance 
we define ebitda as net income or loss plus interest expense net  income tax expense benefit and depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda  to better measure our operating performance 
we regularly use ebitda to evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
adjusted ebitda and the leverage ratio are the amounts used in our current debt covenants 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges 
adjusted ebitda and the leverage ratio are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and the leverage ratio are not recognized terms under us gaap and are not an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap or an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of operating liquidity 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda  adjusted ebitda and the leverage ratio may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
additionally  ebitda or adjusted ebitda are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as they do not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments  interest payments and other contractual obligations 
the leverage ratio is calculated as the company s senior funded indebtedness divided by annualized adjusted ebitda as calculated below 
the senior funded indebtedness as of december  is million and includes the amounts outstanding under our revolver  amounts of the letters of credit available to be issued under our letter of credit facility and the amounts outstanding on the term loan as of december  years ended december december net loss income tax benefit interest expense interest income depreciation  depletion  and amortization ebitda before adjustments other adjustments specified in our current debt agreement gain on curtailment of pension plan charges associated with repayment of debt other adjustments adjusted ebitda item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our million senior notes have a fixed interest rate and are not sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
our revolver and term facility entered into in february of have floating interest rates based on our option of either the base rate or libor rate 
as of december   we had no borrowing outstanding under the revolver and million outstanding under the term facility 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to manage this risk 
a basis point increase in the average interest rate for our floating rate borrowings would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million for each million of borrowings under the revolver and term facilities 
we manage our commodity price risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which we define as contracts with a term of one year or more  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts was approximately for the year ended december  all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we are not engaged in any foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions and we have no trading market risk
