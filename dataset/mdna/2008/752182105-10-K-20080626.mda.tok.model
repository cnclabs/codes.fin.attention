such uncertainties include  among others  the following factors overview business rand logistics  inc formerly rand acquisition corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  as a blank check company to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of lower lakes towing ltd  a canadian corporation which  with its subsidiary lower lakes transportation company  provides bulk freight shipping services throughout the great lakes region 
as part of the acquisition of lower lakes  we also acquired lower lakes affiliate  grand river navigation company  inc prior to the acquisition  we did not conduct  or have any investment in  any operating business 
in this discussion of rand s business  unless the context otherwise requires  references to rand include rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries  and references to lower lakes business or the business of lower lakes mean the combined businesses of lower lakes towing  lower lakes transportation and grand river 
rand s shipping business is operated in canada by lower lakes towing and in the united states by lower lakes transportation 
lower lakes towing was organized in march under the laws of canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports in the great lakes that were restricted in their ability to receive larger vessels 
lower lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full service shipping company with a fleet of thirteen cargo carrying vessels  including one vessel is operated under a contract of affreightment 
from its exclusively canadian beginnings  lower lakes has also grown to offer domestic services to both canadian and us customers as well as cross border routes 
lower lakes services the construction  electric utility and integrated steel industries through the transportation of limestone  coal  iron ore  salt  grain and other dry bulk commodities 
we believe that lower lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port to port services to both canada and the united states in the great lakes region 
lower lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both us and canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the shipping act   and the merchant marine act   commonly referred to as the jones act  in the us and the coasting trade act canada in canada 
results of operations year ended march  the fiscal year ended march  was highlighted by several significant events the three wms vessels did not sail from may through august of due to a strike by its licensed officers 
after wms negotiated a contract extension with its unlicensed officers and hired new licensed officers  the three wms vessels sailed over the last few months of the season with reduced overall productivity due to new licensed officers operating the vessels 
as a result of the strike on the wms vessels  we were required to voyage charter some of our customer deliveries to other third party carriers  for which we receive very small margins 
in addition  the strike caused inefficiencies in delivery routes and cargo carried by our core vessels which negatively impacted our revenues and margins 
we acquired two bulk carriers on august  which provided just over four months of revenue for the company but required a full season of winter work expense 
we exercised our option to buy the three wms vessels at the end of the sailing season  which we believe will result in substantially increased cash flow in future years 
we transferred one of these vessels to our canadian subsidiary and the other two vessels will be operated by our us subsidiary 
we retired and scrapped our oldest and smallest vessel at the end of the season  which will result in a modest reduction of earnings in future years 
increases in our fuel costs through the year were passed on to customers through fuel surcharges which reduced our margin percentages  but not our margin dollars 
we experienced increased general and administrative costs stemming from consulting  outsourcing  and staffing upgrades to our management infrastructure and controls  particularly in the finance and it functions 
the strengthening canadian dollar and acquisition integration also increased general and administrative expenses

for a discussion of fin r  see note to our financial statements 
revenues for the year ended march  were million  an increase of from million during the year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the voyageur vessels and increased revenues from our core vessels

in  sailing days  defined as vessels crewed and available for sailing  increased days to  days  including days from the acquired voyageur vessels from  days in the year ended march  excluding the acquired voyageur vessels  sailing days dropped days from  which included days lost from the strike impacted wms vessels  and days lost from the core vessels due to certain vessel incidents and sailing season repairs 
management believes that each of our vessels should achieve approximately sailing days per year in an average great lakes season  assuming average winter weather and ice  as average winterwork  capital expenditures and dry docking cycle times performed during the winter lay up period 
vessel margins  which is revenue reduced for voyage charters  charter hire  vessel operating expenses  and repairs and maintenance  decreased million to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  
vessel margins  excluding the consolidated vie  decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the decrease was attributable to the million increase in the loss from the strike impacted wms vessels offset by increased vessel margins from our other vessels 
the newly acquired voyageur vessels generated approximately of vessel margins from approximately four months of operations  but were offset by a full season of winterwork expense 
vessel margins on our core vessels increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  vessel margins for the consolidated vie increased million to million  which reflected a full season of operating under the time charter contract 
management believes that vessel margins are an important measure of the cashflow generated by individual vessels to evaluate performance and to make investment decisions 
repairs and maintenance expenses  which consist of expensed winterwork  are a component of vessel operating cost and increased to  in the year ended march  compared to  in the year ended march  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the two voyageur vessels 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  the increase included million of higher cash expenses  million related to the increase in the canadian dollar  due to higher non cash equity compensation and due to higher general and administrative cost in the vie 
most of the higher cash expenses were related to upgrading our finance and it infrastructure  as well as expensed legal costs related to the voyageur vessel acquisition 
general and administrative expense represented of revenues in the year ended march   an increase from of revenues in the year ended march  excluding the vie  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in the year ended march   compared to in the year ended march  depreciation expense rose million to million in the year ended march  due to a stronger canadian dollar  the acquisition of the two voyageur vessels  certain capital expenditures and the full year effect of depreciation of the wms vessels at the vie 
amortization of dry dock costs increased million to million in the year ended march   due to the amortization in the year ended march  of those dry dockings completed for the winter season 
dry docking costs prior to march  were considered in the fair value valuation of the vessels on the date of our acquisition of lower lakes 
amortization of intangibles increased million to million in the year ended march   due to the acquisition of the voyageur vessels and the conversion of values amortized in canadian dollars 
in the year ended march   we incurred a loss of million with the net book value write off of our oldest vessel  which was retired at the end the fiscal sailing season 
the vie recorded a gain of million on the sale of the wms vessels to rand in february  which is consolidated under fin r 
as a result of the items listed above in the year ended march   the loss before other income and expenses and income taxes increased million to a loss of million as compared to a loss of million for the year ended march  interest expense increased million to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  as a result of the increase in term loans arising from financing the acquisitions of the voyager and wms vessels  as well as the full year effect of loans to the vie 
we wrote off million in of deferred financing costs in fiscal as a result of entering into a new amended and restated credit agreement with our lender 
we recorded a loss on interest rate swap contracts of million in fiscal as a result of writing such swap contracts down to fair value as of march  such swap contracts were entered in connection with the new term loans in our amended and restated credit agreement 
the vie was deconsolidated from rand s financial statements effective february  after the acquisition of the wms vessels  which resulted in a loss 
the loss before income taxes and minority interest was million in the year ended march  compared to a loss of million in the year ended march  our recovery from income tax represented a negative provision income of million in the year ended march  and million in the year ended march  our net loss increased million to million in the year ended march  from a loss of million in the year ended march  we accrued million for cash dividends on our preferred stock in the year ended march  compared to million in the year ended march  the vie paid a cash dividend on its common stock of in the year ended march  we also recorded million of stock warrant inducement discount in connection with the per warrant discount on the  warrants which were exercised during the fiscal year 
as a result of the items above  rand s net loss applicable to common shareholders increased million to million in the year ended march  from million in the year ended march  impact of inflation and changing prices for the fiscal year ended march  and march   the annual inflation rates in canada were and  respectively  based on the core cpi rate calculated by the bank of canada 
during the same two years  the us key inflation rates were and  respectively  based on the cpi u rate calculated by the us department of labor 
during these periods  rand sought and achieved revenue increases from renewing customer contracts  which were typically to years in length 
lower lakes estimates that price increases averaged at least to per year during these two periods as a result of inflation 
during the past two years  the impact of inflation on income from continuing operations is estimated by lower lakes to be between to per year  as both revenues and costs increased proportionately due to inflation during such period 
liquidity and capital resources rand s primary sources of liquidity are provided by operations  our credit facility  the exercise of our outstanding warrants and the issuance of common stock 
principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions  capital expenditures  drydock expenditures  operations  and principal payments on our amended and restated credit facility 
information on rand s consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows categorized by operating  financing and investing activities which is included in rand s audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended march  and march  we believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowing under our amended and restated credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
investments in capital expenditures and dry dockings rand expended million in capital expenditures in fiscal  including million related to the wms acquisition and million in vessel upgrades

borrowings under the canadian swing line facility will bear an interest rate per annum equal to the canadian prime rate as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement  plus per annum 
borrowings under the us revolving credit facility and the us term loan will bear interest  at the borrowers option equal to i libor as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement plus per annum  or ii the us base rate as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement  plus per annum

the interest rates shall be adjusted quarterly commencing on the second quarter of fiscal year based upon the borrowers senior debt to ebitda ratio as calculated in accordance with the amended and restated credit agreement 
obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement are secured by i a first priority lien and security interest on all of the borrowers and guarantors assets  tangible or intangible  real  personal or mixed  existing and newly acquired  ii a pledge by rand ll holdings of all of the outstanding capital stock of the borrowers  and iii a pledge by the registrant of all of the outstanding capital stock of rand ll holdings and rand finance 
the indebtedness of each borrower under the amended and restated credit agreement is unconditionally guarantied by each other borrower and by the guarantors  and such guaranty is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of each borrower and each guarantor 
under the amended and restated credit agreement  the borrowers will be required to make mandatory prepayments of principal on term loan borrowings i if the outstanding balance of the term loans plus the outstanding balance of the seasonal facilities exceeds the sum of of the fair market value of the vessels owned by the borrowers  less the amount of outstanding liens against the vessels with priority over the lenders liens  in an amount equal to such excess  ii in the event of certain dispositions of assets and insurance proceeds all subject to certain exceptions  in an amount equal to of the net proceeds received by the borrowers there from  and iii in an amount equal to of the net proceeds to a borrower from any issuance of a borrower s debt or equity securities

in addition  the amended and restated credit agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios 
failure of the borrowers or the guarantors to comply with any of these covenants or financial ratios could result in the loans under the amended and restated credit agreement being accelerated 
seasonality lower lakes is subject to a cyclical industry  primarily due to the typical cold weather patterns on the great lakes from december through march which cause lock closures  waterway ice  and customer facility closings  which typically shut down shipping for a period of up to days commencing from late december to mid january  and continuing until late march to early april 
lower lakes also experiences a cyclical pattern for its capital spending cycle  typically off season from the shipping revenues  to permit annual maintenance and investment in the vessels 
this places additional adverse pressures on lower lakes liquidity and capital resources 
such winterwork  capital expenditure  and dry docking costs are incurred during a period when customer collections have ended from the prior season  and fit out and vessel operating costs will be incurred at the beginning of the season as much as to days prior to the receipt of significant customer collections 
to counter these negative working capital cycles  lower lakes amended and restated credit facility includes a revolver feature with a seasonal overadvance facility which provides working capital from the march through june period  after which customer collections typically exceed cash disbursements 
foreign exchange rate risk rand has foreign currency exposure related to the currency related remeasurements of its various financial instruments denominated in the canadian dollar fair value risk and operating cash flows denominated in the canadian dollar cash flow risk 
these exposures are associated with period to period changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
at march   rand s liability for financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately cdn million of term loans in canada  compared to a liability of cdn million in term loans and cdn million of revolver borrowings in canada at march  although rand has tried to match its indebtedness by country with its cashflows  the sudden change in exchange rates can increase the indebtedness converted to us dollars before the operating cashflows can make up for such a currency conversion change 
from a cash flow perspective  rand s operations are insulated against changes in currency rates as operations in canada and the united states have revenues and expenditures denominated in local currencies and the operations are cash flow positive 
however  as stated above  the majority of the rand s financial liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars which exposes the company to currency risks related to principal payments and interest payments on such financial liability instruments 
interest rate risk rand is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates associated with its revolver debt 
lower lakes amended and restated credit agreement carries interest rates which vary with canadian prime rates and ba rates for canadian borrowings  and us prime rates and libor rates on us borrowings 
rand has entered into two interest rate swap contracts for all of its term loans for the full term of such term loans based on three month ba rates for the canadian term loans and three month us libor rates for the us term loans 
the rates on these instruments  prior to the addition of the lender s margin  are on the canadian term loans  and on the us term loans 
rand will be exposed to risk under these contracts if they are required to be amended or terminated earlier than contracted 
off balance sheet arrangements options and warrants issued in conjunction with our initial public offering are equity linked derivatives and accordingly represent off balance sheet arrangements 
the options and warrants meet the scope exception in paragraph a of fas and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of fas  but instead are accounted for as equity 
see the notes to the march  financial statements for a discussion of outstanding options and warrants 
on august   in connection with the coa and option agreement  lower lakes entered into a guarantee with ge canada the guarantee  pursuant to which lower lakes agreed to guarantee up to cdn million the guaranteed obligations of voyageur s indebtedness to ge canada 
lower lakes maximum future payments under the guarantee are limited to the guaranteed obligations plus the costs and expenses ge canada incurs while enforcing its rights under the guarantee 
lower lakes obligations under the guarantee shall become due should voyageur fail to meet certain financial covenants under the terms of its loan from ge canada or if voyageur breaches certain of its obligations under the coa 
lower lakes has several options available to it in the event that ge canada intends to draw under the guarantee  including i the right to exercise its option for the trader under the option agreement and ii the right to make a subordinated secured loan to voyageur in an amount at least equal to the amount intended to be drawn by ge canada on terms as are reasonably satisfactory to ge canada and voyageur 
in the event ge canada makes a demand against lower lakes pursuant to the terms of the guarantee  through a letter of credit agreement  dated august   an affiliate of voyageur has agreed to contribute half of any amounts drawn under the guarantee through a cdn million letter of credit provided to lower lakes 
voyageur has been determined to be a variable interest entity of the company under us gaap 
rand has determined that it is not a primary beneficiary of voyageur s remaining business and therefore rand is not required to consolidate voyageur s financial statements 
critical accounting policies rand s significant accounting policies are presented in note to its fiscal audited consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this proxy statement 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the financial statements and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition the company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment voyage charters generally on a rate per ton basis 
voyage charter revenue is recognized ratably over the period from the departure of a vessel from its original shipping point to its destination  when the following conditions are met the company has a signed contract of affreightment  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges  which represent pass through charges to customers for toll fees  lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties 
fuel surcharges are recognized ratably over the voyage  while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred 
freight surcharges are insignificant and amount to less than of total revenues for the periods presented 
the company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers 
service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are being provided to customers 
consequently  revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above 
in addition  revenues are presented on a gross basis in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
costs for subcontracted freight providers  presented as outside voyage charter fees on the statement of operations are recognized ratably over the voyage 
intangible assets and goodwill the company adopted statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill will not be amortized  but will be tested at least annually for impairment  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
if the asset is impaired  it will be written down to its fair value 
intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  financing costs  trademarks  trade names  non competition agreements and customer relationships and contracts 
in accordance with sfas  the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step impairment test to first identify potential impairment and then to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
chartering agreement costs are primarily legal costs of establishing the time chartering agreements with the vie  including loan and guaranty documentation 
these costs were amortized over the term of the time chartering agreement  and related debt 
other intangibles are amortized as follows trademarks and trade names years straight line non competition agreements years straight line customer relationships and contracts years straight line chartering agreement costs term of chartering agreement property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and have been valued as of the date of acquisition 
depreciation methods for capital assets are as follows vessels years straight line leasehold improvements years straight line furniture and equipment declining balance computer equipment declining balance deferred charges deferred charges include capitalized drydock expenditures and deferred financing costs 
drydock costs incurred during statutory canadian and united states certification processes are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the benefit period  which is months 
drydock costs include costs of work performed by third party shipyards  subcontractors and other direct expenses to complete the mandatory certification process 
deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related debt  which approximates the effective interest method 
repairs and maintenance the company s vessels require repairs and maintenance each year to ensure the fleet is operating efficiently during the shipping season 
the vast majority of repairs and maintenance are completed in january  february and march of each year when the vessels are inactive 
the company expenses such routine repairs and maintenance costs 
significant repairs to the company s vessels  whether owned or available to the company under a time charter  such as major engine overhauls and hull repairs  are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the asset repaired  or remaining lease term  whether it is engine equipment  the vessel  or leasehold improvements to a vessel leased under time charter agreement 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets include property  intangible assets subject to amortization  and certain other assets 
the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill with their carrying values 
the company determines fair value of goodwill by evaluating the fair value of the acquired business as well as using the sum of the undiscounted cash flows projected to be generated by the acquired business giving rise to that goodwill 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s services and future market conditions 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using undiscounted expected cash flows attributable to the assets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recognized  if necessary  to measure tax benefits to the extent that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
rand believes that such tax benefits will be realized 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the impact of the company s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective april  the adoption of fin on april  did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit 
at april   the company had no unrecognized tax benefits which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
consistent with its historical financial reporting  the company has elected to classify interest expense related to income tax liabilities  when applicable  as part of the interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations rather than income tax expense 
the company will continue to classify income tax penalties as part of selling  general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of operations 
to date  the company has not incurred material interest expenses or penalties relating to assessed taxation years 
stock based compensation effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
this method requires compensation cost to be recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date 
under this method  the company recognizes compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after april  compensation expense for the unvested portion of the awards that was outstanding on april  is recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period based on the fair value at date of grant as calculated under the black scholes option pricing model 
variable interest entities the company uses fasb interpretation fin r  which requires the company to consolidate certain entities on the basis other than through ownership of a voting interest of the entity 
two vie s have been identified and wms had been consolidated in accordance with fin r through the deconsolidation date of february  though the voyageur group of companies is a variable interest entity for rand  it does not meet criteria for consolidation and hence is not consolidated 
on february   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with wms a vie until that date to buy the entire remaining assets of the vie 
based on this reconsideration event  the company is no longer the primary beneficiary under fin r and is no longer required to consolidate wms financial statements
