the term loan is amortized based on a term of seven years with a balloon payment on the remaining outstanding principal due at the maturity of the agreement  may if average availability should fall below million over a day period  the loans become immediately secured by a lien on the company s equipment that is not encumbered by other liens 
the company is obligated to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio of to in july  chaparral steel company  our primary supplier of sheet piling and bearing pile  announced that it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by gerdau ameristeel corporation 
this transaction closed in september if we are unable to continue to distribute the products of gerdau ameristeel corporation  our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 
in september  the dm e announced it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of the canadian pacific railway limited cp would be merged into the dm e  with the dm e being the surviving corporation 
in october  the merger agreement between the dm e and the cp was consummated

our agreement with the uprr includes their purchasing concrete ties from our grand island  ne facility through and our tucson  az facility through while the uprr will continue to purchase concrete ties under this agreement  total concrete ties purchased by the uprr in will be reduced by approximately from its purchase levels 
while we believe that the uprr purchasing level for concrete ties will improve beyond  we have taken certain steps to mitigate the effects of this loss of business including reducing the workforce at both of our facilities as well as other efficiency efforts including extending the cure times of the concrete ties we are currently producing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period and because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product liability accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product liability claims 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
slow moving inventory the company maintains reserves for slow moving inventory 
these reserves  which are reviewed and adjusted routinely  take into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used in calculating the reserve can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
at december  and  the reserve for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual direct labor costs to estimated total direct labor costs 
as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  sfas requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was and for and  respectively 
on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas required the company to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses  unrecognized prior service costs  and unrecognized transition assets remaining from the initial adoption of sfas deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation applies to all open tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas this interpretation is intended to result in increased relevance and comparability in financial reporting of income taxes and to provide more information about the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
we adopted this interpretation on january  see note  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense benefit and net income loss 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather it applies under existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
 sfas 
sfas permits entities to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard will not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r which replaces sfas no 
sfas r retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  the company will adopt the provisions of this standard beginning january  results of operations three months ended twelve months ended december  december  dollars in thousands net sales rail products construction products tubular products total net sales gross profit rail products construction products tubular products other total gross profit expenses selling and administrative expenses interest expense dividend income gain on sale of dm e investment interest income other income expense total income expenses income from continuing operations  before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operations income tax benefit expense loss income from discontinued operations net income gross profit rail products construction products tubular products total gross profit fourth quarter of vs 
fourth quarter of income from continuing operations and net income for the fourth quarter of was million per diluted share on net sales of million 
income from continuing operations and net income for the fourth quarter of includes a pre tax gain of million from the sale of our investment in the dm e railroad 
this compares favorably to income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of which was million per diluted share on net sales of million 
net sales increased million  or  compared to the prior year quarter 
rail segment sales increased due to our concrete railroad tie sales which increased compared to the same prior year quarter primarily due to our tucson  az facility which started producing and selling concrete railroad ties in the first quarter of last year represented a start up year for this facility and it produced only minimal concrete railroad ties late in the fourth quarter of our allegheny rail products division also contributed to the growth with increased sales volumes and production at the pueblo  co and niles  oh facilities 
during the prior year quarter  our pueblo  co facility  where we manufacture insulated rail joints  experienced production start up inefficiencies which were largely corrected during lastly  our rail distribution sales increase was associated with higher volumes of scrap and reroll products sales 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes from rail project work 
construction products sales decreased due mainly to reduced piling sales 
in the prior year period  delivery of two large orders of flat sheet piling sales were deferred from the third quarter into the fourth quarter due to customer delays 
this resulted in a large spike in piling sales during the fourth quarter of tubular products sales increased compared to the fourth quarter of due to growth in both our coated pipe and threaded products divisions 
the coated pipe division s sales growth came from continued demand from a strong energy market 
gross profit margin increased percentage points to compared to last year s fourth quarter 
rail products profit margin increased percentage points to 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased billing margins  decreased unfavorable plant variances and decreased warranty expense at our spokane  wa concrete tie facility 
additionally  our transit products division s gross profit margin increased due to product mix 
construction products gross profit margin increased percentage points to 
product mix with our piling sales contributed to the increased gross profit 
tubular products gross profit margin increased by percentage points to due primarily to improved volume related efficiencies within the coated pipe division 
selling and administrative expenses increased from the same prior year period due to increases in employee related costs including benefit expenses 
interest expense decreased due to reduced average borrowings 
in connection with the sale of the dm e railroad  we stopped accruing dividend income and recorded a pre tax gain of million during the fourth quarter of the proceeds received from this sale were invested in a series of short term  tax free mutual funds resulting in the receipt of million of interest income during the fourth quarter of more information about the dm e and its merger agreement with the cp can be found on page of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes from continuing operations in the fourth quarter were recorded at approximately compared to in the prior year period 
the year compared to the year for the year ended december   income from continuing operations was million per diluted share on net sales of million 
income from continuing operations includes the aforementioned million pre tax gain from the sale of our investment in the dm e railroad 
additionally  income from continuing operations includes million of incremental dividend income recognized in the third quarter of when the sale of the dm e railroad was announced 
this compares favorably to income from continuing operations of million per diluted share for on net sales of million 
including the pre tax gain and dividend income related to the dm e sale  net income for was million per diluted share 
including income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share  which includes a gain on the sale of the company s former geotechnical division of approximately million  net income for was million per diluted share 
net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the prior year 
rail segment sales increased  or million from the prior year  primarily as a result of increased revenues from rail distribution  which were driven mainly by new rail project work 
secondly  we produced and sold more concrete ties during than in the previous year due principally to production at our tucson  az facility 
last year represented a start up year for this facility and it produced and sold only minimal ties late in the fourth quarter of our grand island  ne facility was also able to increase tie production in due to the installation of a fifth production line at the facility 
our agreement with the uprr includes their purchasing concrete ties from our grand island  ne facility through and our tucson  az facility through while the uprr will continue to purchase concrete ties under this agreement  total concrete ties purchased by the uprr in will be reduced by approximately from its purchase levels 
thirdly  our transit products division had improved sales from a strong backlog entering safetea lu  legislation that authorized funding for transit products  led to increased transit agency spending 
finally  our arp division benefited from increased sales at both our pueblo  co and niles  oh facilities 
construction segment sales increased  or million from the prior year due primarily to increased piling sales as well as increased sales from concrete buildings 
our h beam and pipe piling products drove the overall increase in piling sales  benefiting from a combination of both price increases and strong customer demand throughout these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bridge products revenues 
three large bridge jobs were completed during which had a positive impact on that period s sales 
tubular segment sales increased  or million  over the prior year due to increased sales volumes in both our coated pipe and threaded products divisions 
the coated pipe division s sales increased due to a strong energy market leading to the addition of a second shift during a portion of the second quarter and all of the third quarter of at our birmingham  al facility 
our threaded products division has benefited from its entrance into the micropile market and providing limited service to the oil country tubular goods market  both of which have added volume to our langfield  tx facility 
we anticipate strength in all three of our business segments  we do not  however  provide assurances that the rate of growth or sales levels will remain at these levels during our gross margin percentage increased percentage points to compared to in rail products gross margin percentage increased to  an increase of percentage points over the prior year period 
increased plant efficiencies at our spokane  wa facility and a full year of production at our tucson  az tie facility contributed to the margin expansion 
construction products gross margin percentage increased percentage points to from the year earlier period as a result of improved performance across all product lines except concrete buildings 
our spokane  wa facility experienced high employee turnover leading to an inexperienced workforce that contributed to higher unfavorable plant variances at this facility 
tubular products gross margin percentage increased to from in  an increase of percentage points  due to improved billing margins within both divisions and improved volume related efficiencies within our coated pipe division 
selling and administrative expenses increased million or over the prior year comparable period due to increases in employee related costs and benefit expenses including incentive compensation 
interest expense increased million  or  due to increased average borrowings during the first half of the year 
we were able to reduce outstanding borrowings during the second half of as a result of generating strong positive cash flows from operations 
at the announcement of the sale of the dm e railroad  we recognized million of previously unrecognized dividend income due from the dm e 
this increase was offset by the loss of million in dividend income which would have been recognized during the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of the dm e railroad  we recorded a pre tax gain of million 
we invested the proceeds received from this sale in a series of short term  tax free mutual funds resulting in the receipt of million of interest income during the fourth quarter

outlook our cxt rail and arp divisions are dependent on the union pacific railroad uprr for a significant portion of their business 
subsequent to the january execution of a concrete tie supply agreement with uprr  we installed new tie manufacturing equipment at our grand island  ne facility and commenced production of concrete ties in september during the fourth quarter of  the refurbished grand island  ne facility has been producing concrete ties at a rate above the maximum capacity of the old facility 
in addition to upgrading the grand island facility  we have completed a new concrete railroad tie manufacturing facility in tucson  az 
despite construction delays attributable to permitting and other operational issues  the facility started tie production in the fourth quarter of  with meaningful production beginning in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  production at the facility had been hampered by employee turnover caused by the emergence of higher paying new businesses in the tucson  az area 
including the tucson  az facility  the company produced more concrete railroad ties over the prior year fourth quarter 
excluding the tucson  az operations  concrete tie production has increased approximately in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year period 
our agreement with the uprr includes their purchasing concrete ties from our grand island  ne facility through and our tucson  az facility through while the uprr will continue to purchase concrete ties under this agreement  total concrete ties purchased by the uprr in will be reduced by approximately from its purchase levels 
while we believe that the uprr purchasing level for concrete ties will improve beyond  we have taken certain steps to mitigate this loss of business including reducing the workforce at both of our facilities as well as other efficiency efforts including extending the cure times of the concrete ties we are currently producing 
certain of our operating groups sold  from time to time  to the dm e railroad and construction related materials 
as a result of the merger agreement  certain of this business may be provided to the dm e directly from other suppliers through existing cp relationships

in connection with the ratification of the new collective bargaining agreement with our spokane  wa workforce  the company should be able to hire and retain better qualified employees and be more competitive in the marketplace 
a more qualified and experienced workforce should  over time  reduce the prolonged production times which have had a negative impact on the financial results of this operation
