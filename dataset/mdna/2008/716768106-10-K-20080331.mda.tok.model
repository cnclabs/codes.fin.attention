we experienced a series of pet food recalls that had a negative impact on sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  insurance liabilities and reserves  asset impairments  reserves for closed stores  reserves against deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers and forward distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter 
stores perform physical inventories at least once a year  and between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
most of the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the year due to the holiday season  but continue to perform counts on certain inventory items 
as of the end of a reporting period  there will be stores with certain inventory items that have not been counted 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical cost 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
as of february  and january   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 
asset impairments we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we conduct this review annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of such assets may not be recoverable 
there were no material asset impairments identified during 
table of contents reserves for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our retail stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as of february   and january   we had closed store reserves of million and million  respectively 
we can make no assurances that additional charges for these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of pets  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately billion in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies as of february   we retained an initial risk of loss of million per occurrence for general liability and million per occurrence for workers compensation 
we establish reserves for losses based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
as of february  and january   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at february   and january   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
as of january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents the percent to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income year ended february  january  january  weeks weeks weeks statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating  general and administrative expenses operating income gain on sale of investment interest income interest expense income before income tax expense and equity in income from investee income tax expense equity in income from investee net income weeks compared to weeks net sales net sales increased million  or  to billion in  compared to net sales of billion in the sales increase is primarily due to the addition of net new stores since january   the rd week of sales and a increase in comparable store sales for the rd week increased net sales by approximately million 
our comparable store sales growth was for the decrease in our comparable sales growth rate was due to economic conditions  a slow down in consumer spending and the impact of the recall of certain pet food products during the first two quarters of  as well as reduced sales of equine products as a result of our decision to exit that product line 
services sales  which are included in our net sales amount discussed above and include grooming  training  boarding and day camp  increased by  or million  to million 
this increase was primarily due to continued strong demand for our grooming and training services  the addition of new petshotels during and the rd week  which increased services sales by million 
gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for from for fixed costs in cost of sales  including store occupancy costs and warehouse and distribution costs  increased as a percentage of net sales 
in  we opened net new stores  petshotels and a new distribution center and completed a portion of the store remodel projects 
these investments increased the amount of rent and other occupancy costs and increased depreciation expense 
these additional expenses coupled with a slower growth rate in net sales decreased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
additionally  services sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
services sales generate lower gross margins than product sales as we include service related labor in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating 
table of contents margins than merchandise sales 
we also opened petshotels in compared to in fiscal petshotels have higher costs as a percentage of net sales in the first several years 
these decreases in the gross profit percentages were partially offset by improvements in merchandise margins 
merchandise margins continued to benefit from pricing initiatives  partially offset by a change in product mix 
hardgood sales  which generally have higher gross margins than consumable merchandise  grew at a slower rate than consumable sales 
in  we entered into a new master operating agreement with mmih that has an initial year term and has resulted in higher license fees 
we charge mmih license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we treat these amounts as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we also charge mmih for its portion of specific operating expenses and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expense 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for from for during  we experienced lower expense for general liability and health insurance compared to due to lower average claims during the year 
the improvements in claim activity resulted in a smaller increase in the actuarial assessments of our required reserves than in the prior year 
in addition  bonus expense decreased in we also recognized million of gift card breakage income in gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
during  we obtained sufficient historical redemption data for our gift card program to make a reasonable estimate of the ultimate redemption patterns and breakage rate 
fiscal was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage income 
in addition  expenses decreased in our e commerce business due to the exit of our equine product line 
this business  which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  decreased as a percentage of total sales 
these expense decreases were offset by expenses incurred to exit our equine product line and by higher corporate payroll and other expenses 
the expenses to exit the equine product line included accelerated depreciation of assets  severance and costs to remerchandise the equine sections of our stores 
corporate payroll and other expenses continued to increase as our revenue growth slowed 
gain on sale of investment and equity in income from investee during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of our non voting shares in mmih resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  we also converted our remaining mmih non voting shares to voting shares 
the increase in voting shares caused us to exceed the significant influence threshold as defined by gaap  which required us to account for our investment in mmih using the equity method of accounting instead of the previously applied cost method in accordance with apb no 
conversion to the equity method of accounting would typically require a restatement of prior years consolidated financial statements for the mmih earnings 
however  since the amounts are not material  we have not restated prior year financial statements 
interest income interest income decreased to million for compared to million for  primarily due to lower average investments in auction rate securities during the year  partially due to our use of available cash to fund a portion of the asr 
as of february   we had no investments in auction rate securities 

table of contents interest expense interest expense increased to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to continued increases in capital lease obligations and new bank borrowings during to fund a portion of the asr 
income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of 
the effective rate for includes a benefit from the use of capital loss carryforwards to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of mmih non voting shares and benefits from the release of uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and from the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions 
the effective rate for includes the settlement of an audit with the internal revenue service and tax benefits primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions and additional federal and state tax credits 
weeks compared to weeks net sales net sales for increased million  or  to billion  compared to net sales of billion in  due to the addition of net new stores and a increase in comparable store sales for our comparable store sales growth was for we believe the increase in our comparable store sales growth rate during as compared to was due to general economic conditions 
our results were also impacted by a dramatic increase in fuel prices which affected consumer spending 
in addition  we lost days of sales from temporary store closures due to the effect of hurricanes in the third quarter of services sales increased by  or million  to million 
this increase was primarily due to continued strong demand for our grooming and training services as well as the addition of new petshotels during gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for from for services sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
services sales generate lower gross margins than product sales as we include service related labor in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  however  services generate higher operating margins than product sales 
in addition  we opened petshotels in fiscal compared to in petshotels have higher costs as a percentage of revenue in the first several years 
we also experienced higher redemptions of promotional offers in our petperks program  which are recorded as a reduction in sales  in compared to also contributing to the gross profit percentage decline was a revision of our early pay discounts recognition policy 
historically  discounts were recognized as they were taken against payments 
under our revised policy  discounts are recorded as a reduction of inventory and recognized as a reduction in cost of sales as inventory is sold 
we recorded a million charge in the second quarter of for this change 
we also incurred approximately million additional expense in the second and third quarter of as well as a shift in mix from higher margin hard goods towards consumables primarily in the second quarter of as we worked through an unplanned re racking project in our phoenix distribution center 
in addition  we had some higher costs in our supply chain to increase service levels to our stores during the holiday season 
these negative margin impacts were partially offset by continued positive results from improved buying practices and pricing initiatives 
in addition  included charges to increase our inventory obsolescence reserve  
table of contents and we did not experience the same level of obsolescence expense in we also capitalized more costs into ending inventory as a percentage of revenue in compared to operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to for from for net expenses resulting from legal settlements reflected a year over year increase 
fiscal included a million expense to accrue for an ongoing legal proceeding while included reductions in expenses from an million legal settlement gain and a million credit card settlement gain 
fiscal also included a reduction in expense due to a correction in stock based compensation 
we accelerated into several initiatives  which include strengthening our distribution processes  improving our information systems and investing in our associates and their education  originally planned for and also contributing to the increased expenses was the review of a potential acquisition we ultimately chose not to pursue 
other professional fees also increased as we invested in projects to continue to improve our supply chain and information technology infrastructure 
the increased expenses described above were partially offset by several factors 
we saw a decrease in advertising expense due to higher expenses for our mart to smart advertising initiative in we have also allocated more of our marketing spending to petperks promotional offers in  which are recorded as a reduction of sales 
depreciation expense in was lower as a percentage of revenue compared to  as a significant asset reached the end of its depreciable life in stock compensation expense was lower as a percentage of revenue in compared to due to higher forfeitures in as well as a change in forfeiture assumptions for the unvested options and restricted stock 
interest income interest income increased to million during compared to million during primarily due to higher rates of return on our investments in auction rate securities 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for fiscal  from million for primarily due to an increase in capital lease obligations in income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of 
during  we settled an audit with the internal revenue service 
this included settlement of an affirmative issue we raised during with respect to the characterization of certain losses 
the settlement resulted in an overall benefit of million 
we also recorded tax benefits of approximately million primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions and additional federal and state tax credits 
during  we recorded a reduction to income tax expense of approximately million as the period of assessment  during which additional tax may be imposed for years prior to  expired for several jurisdictions 
as a result  we determined that approximately million of tax contingency reserves were no longer required  with approximately million as an increase to additional paid in capital 
we also recorded additional tax expense of approximately million resulting from corrections of our deferred tax assets 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow and balance sheet data the following table represents our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and restricted short term investments in thousands february  january  january  cash and cash equivalents short term investments restricted cash and restricted short term investments total we finance our operations  new store and petshotel growth  store remodels and other expenditures to support our growth initiatives primarily through cash generated by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for and million for receipts from our sales come from cash  checks and third party debit and credit cards  and therefore provide a significant source of liquidity 
cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund procurement of merchandise inventory and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  million for and million for the net cash used in consisted primarily of capital expenditures and the purchase of store locations resulting in net new stores in canada 
capital expenditures consisted primarily of expenditures associated with opening or acquiring new stores  reformatting existing stores  expenditures associated with equipment and computer software in support of our system initiatives  petshotel construction costs  costs to expand our distribution network and other expenditures to support our growth plans and initiatives 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investment in mmih  a decrease in restricted cash and short term investments and a decrease in short term available for sale investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  million for and million for the net cash used in consisted primarily of the purchase of treasury stock  payments on capital lease obligations  a decrease in our bank overdraft and payments of cash dividends 
these activities were partially offset by net borrowings on our credit facility  proceeds from common stock issued under equity incentive plans and tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized 
the primary differences between and were an increase in the amount of treasury stock purchased and borrowings on our credit facility to fund a portion of the asr 
common stock purchase program in june  the board of directors approved a program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock through in august  the board of directors increased the amount remaining under that share purchase program by million  to bring the share purchase capacity under the program to million and extended the term of the program to august  from january  through june   we purchased million shares of our common stock for million under the million program  completing the program 
in august  the board of directors approved a new program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock through august  on august   we entered into a million fixed dollar asr 
the asr contained provisions that established the minimum and maximum number of shares purchased during its term 
pursuant to the terms of the asr  on august   we paid million to the asr counterparty 
the asr was initially funded with million in cash and million in borrowings under our new credit facility 
we received million shares of common stock between august  and january  which were recorded as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheets  completing the asr 
as of february   we had million available under the current million authorization 

table of contents common stock dividends we believe our ability to generate cash allows us to invest in the growth of the business and  at the same time  distribute a quarterly dividend 
our credit facility and letter of credit facility permit us to pay dividends  so long as we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default 
in  the board of directors declared the following dividends dividend amount stockholders of date declared per share record date date paid march  april  may  june  july  august  september  october  november  december  february  february  on march   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on may  to stockholders of record on may  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements substantially all our stores are leased facilities 
we opened or acquired new stores in and closed stores 
generally  each new store requires capital expenditures of approximately million for fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements without petshotel expenditures  approximately million for inventory and approximately million for preopening costs 
we expect total capital spending to be million or less for  based on our plan to open net new stores and new petshotels  to fixture and equip a new distribution center in reno  nevada that will open in  to continue our investment in the development of our information systems  to add to our services capacity with the expansion of certain grooming salons  to remodel or replace certain store assets and to continue our store refresh program 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility and available lease financing  will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs and planned capital expenditures 
our ability to fund our operations and make planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands year ended february  january  january  weeks weeks weeks capital expenditures new stores store related projects petshotel information technology supply chain other total capital expenditures includes store remodels  grooming salon expansion  equipment replacement  relocations and or expansions  as well as various merchandising projects

table of contents lease and other commitments operating and capital lease commitments and other obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property at february   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands and contractual obligation beyond other total operating lease obligations capital lease obligations short term debt purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total less sublease income net total includes million in interest 
credit facility borrowings

approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  as shown in other  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
letters of credit we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements and utilities 
as of february   million was outstanding under our letters of credit 
related party transactions we have an investment in mmi holdings  inc who  through a wholly owned subsidiary  medical management international  inc  operates full service veterinary hospitals inside of our stores 
our investment consists of common and convertible preferred stock 
during the first quarter of  we sold a portion of our non voting shares in mmih resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  we also converted our remaining mmih non voting shares to voting shares 
the increase in voting shares caused us to exceed the significant influence threshold as defined by gaap  which required us to account for our investment in mmih using the equity method of accounting instead of the previously applied cost method in accordance with apb no 
as of february   we owned approximately of the voting stock and approximately of the combined voting and non voting stock of mmih 
conversion to the equity method of accounting would typically require a restatement of prior years consolidated financial statements for mmih earnings 
however  because the amounts are not material  we have not restated prior year financial statements 
our equity income from our investment in mmih  which is recorded one month in arrears  was million for we charge mmih license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we treat these amounts as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we also charge mmih for its portion of specific operating expenses  and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expense 

table of contents in june  we entered into a new master operating agreement with mmih that has an initial year term and was retroactive to february the new agreement includes a change to the calculation of license fees charged to mmih and a provision for mmih to pay their portion of utilities costs 
we recognized license fees  utilities and other cost reimbursements of million and million during and  respectively 
receivables from mmih totaled million and million at february  and january   respectively  and were included in the receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the master operating agreement also includes a provision for the sharing of profits on the sales of therapeutic pet foods sold in all stores with an operating banfield hospital 
credit facility in august  we replaced our existing million credit facility with a million five year revolving credit facility which expires on august  borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a borrowing base and bear interest  at our option  at a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
we are subject to fees payable to lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the credit facility 
the credit facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit  which reduce the amount available under the credit facility 
letter of credit issuances under the credit facility are subject to interest payable to the lenders and bear interest of to for standby letters of credit or to for commercial letters of credit 
in august  we borrowed million under the credit facility to fund a portion of our million asr 
the remaining portion of the asr was funded using existing cash and cash equivalents 
as of february   we had million in borrowings and million in stand by letter of credit issuances under our million five year revolving credit facility 
we also have a million stand alone letter of credit facility that expires on june  we are subject to fees payable to the lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the average daily face amount of the letters of credit outstanding during the preceding calendar quarter 
in addition  we are required to maintain a deposit with the lenders equal to the amount of outstanding letters of credit or  in the case of auction rate securities  must have an amount on deposit  which  when multiplied by the advance rate of  is equal to the amount of outstanding letters of credit under this stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of february   we had no outstanding letters of credit under this stand alone letter of credit facility and had no restricted cash and short term investments on deposit with the lenders in connection with this facility 
we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements and utilities 
the credit facility and letter of credit facility permit the payment of dividends  so long as we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default of the credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of february   we were in compliance with the terms and covenants of our credit facility and letter of credit facility 
the credit facility and letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our personal property assets  our subsidiaries and certain real property 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a fiscal year 
sales of certain products and services are seasonal 
because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store openings and related preopening costs  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  new store 
table of contents openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
we expense preopening costs associated with each new location as the costs are incurred 
our results of operations and financial position are presented based upon historical costs 
while neither inflation nor deflation has had  nor do we expect them to have  a material impact on operating results  we can make no assurances that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future

we had no borrowings under the line of credit during
