item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as part of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by key factors in each of our business divisions as discussed below agribusiness in the agribusiness division  we purchase  store  transport  process and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products 
profitability in this division is affected by the availability and market prices of agricultural commodities and commodity products and the availability and costs of transportation and logistics services  including truck  barge  rail and ocean freight 
additionally  profitability in the division is affected by the relative market prices of processed oilseed products and the raw materials necessary to produce them  which are influenced by global supply and demand for each 
our oilseed processing profitability is also impacted by industry capacity utilization and energy costs 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by weather  plant diseases  governmental policies and agricultural growing patterns 
demand is affected by growth in worldwide consumption of food products  particularly meat and poultry  population growth  changes in per capita incomes  the relative prices of substitute agricultural products  outbreaks of livestock and poultry disease  and  in the past few years  by the growing demand for renewable fuels produced from agricultural commodities and commodity products 
we expect that population growth  rising standards of living and rising global demand for renewable fuels will continue to increase global demand for our agribusiness products 
however  from time to time  imbalances may exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products in certain markets  which impacts our decisions regarding whether  when and where to purchase  store  transport  process or sell these commodities  including whether to change the location of or reduce our own oilseed processing capacity 
fertilizer in the fertilizer division  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the brazilian agricultural sector  agricultural commodity prices  international fertilizer prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted  the quality of the land under cultivation and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
in addition  our selling prices are influenced by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and fertilizer raw materials  such as phosphate  ammonia and urea  as a significant portion of our raw material needs are met with imports 
the brazilian fertilizer business is also a seasonal business with fertilizer sales normally concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
as a result  we generally import and mine raw materials and produce finished goods during the first half of the year in preparation for the main brazilian cultivation season that occurs during the second half of the year 
food products in the food products division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operations are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials  such as crude vegetable oils and grains  the mix of products we sell  changes in eating habits  changes in per capita incomes  consumer purchasing power levels  governmental dietary guidelines and policies  changes in general economic conditions and the competitive environment in the principal markets for our food products division 
competition in this industry has intensified in the past several years due to consolidation in the supermarket industry and attempts by competitors to increase market share 
in addition to the above factors  our results of operations are affected by the following factors foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results can be materially impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
both translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements and foreign currency transactions affect our results as described below 
translation of foreign currency financial statements 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  the functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
we translate the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars on a monthly basis at weighted average exchange rates  which we believe approximate the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions 
translations of the local currency income statement and cash flow amounts to us dollars are affected by fluctuations of the local currency during a period versus the us dollar 
further  comparisons of results between periods are affected by the differences in the average exchange rates during one period versus another 
our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at period end exchange rates  and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
included in other comprehensive income for the years ended december   and were foreign exchange net translation gains of million  million and million  respectively  representing the net gains from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
foreign currency transactions 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries  most significantly those in brazil  have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in us dollars 
these us dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting gains losses are included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains losses 
we also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts  swaps and options  to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
in addition  we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to local currency operating expenses 
these derivative instruments are marked to market  with changes in their fair values recognized as a component of foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
we may also hedge other foreign currency exposures as deemed appropriate 
brazil 
the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiaries is the brazilian real 
as such  exchange rate changes between the us dollar and the real affect our operating profitability 
the real appreciated against the us dollar at december  compared to the rate at december   and the real appreciated against the us dollar at december  when compared to the rate at december  in  the average real us dollar exchange rate was r  compared to r in  which represents a strengthening in the average value of the real versus the us dollar in in  the average us dollar exchange rate was r  compared to r in  which represents an strengthening in the average value of the real versus the us dollar in we use long term intercompany loans to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in brazil  particularly their effects on our results of operations 
these loans do not require cash payment of principal and are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
this is in contrast to foreign exchange gains or losses on third party debt and short term intercompany debt  which are recorded in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
agribusiness segment brazil 
our agribusiness sales are us dollar denominated or us dollar linked 
in addition  commodity inventories in our agribusiness segment are stated at market value  which is generally linked to us dollar based international prices 
as a result  these commodity inventories provide a natural hedge to our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in our agribusiness segment 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally has a negative effect on our agribusiness segment results in brazil  as real denominated industrial costs  which are included in cost of goods sold  and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are translated to us dollars at stronger us dollar exchange rates  which results in higher us dollar costs 
in addition  appreciation of the real generates losses based on the changes in the real denominated value of our commodity inventories  which are reflected in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income 
however  appreciation of the real also generates offsetting net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our brazilian agribusiness subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
as our brazilian subsidiaries are primarily funded with intercompany  us dollar denominated debt  the mark to market losses on the commodity inventories during periods of real appreciation generally offset the foreign exchange gains on the intercompany us dollar denominated debt 
our effective tax rate is also negatively affected by the appreciation of the real  as we recognize tax expenses related to foreign exchange gains on certain intercompany loans 
the foreign exchange gains are eliminated in our consolidated statements of income but the related tax effects remain 
fertilizer segment brazil 
our fertilizer segment sales prices are linked to us dollar priced fertilizer raw materials 
mining  industrial and sg a expenses are real denominated costs 
inventories in our fertilizer segment are accounted for on an average historical cost basis and are not marked to market 
these inventories are generally financed with us dollar denominated liabilities 
appreciation of the real against the us dollar generally results in higher mining  industrial and sg a expenses when translated into us dollars and net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our fertilizer segment subsidiaries 
however  gross profit margins are generally adversely affected by appreciation of the real is our local currency revenues are linked to us dollar priced imported and domestic raw materials  whereas our cost of goods sold would reflect the higher real cost of inventories acquired and produced during a period when the real was weaker 
inventories are acquired and produced throughout the year  whereas sales of fertilizer products are disproportionately concentrated in the second half of the year 
thus  the recording of the exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position and the effects of the appreciating real on our gross profit margins generally do not occur in the same reporting period 
as such  the foreign exchange impact on the intercompany debt is reflected monthly in our results while the impact on gross profit margins is reflected at the time products are sold 
the converse is true for devaluation of the real and the related effect on our consolidated financial statements 
edible oil and milling products segment brazil 
our food products businesses are generally local currency businesses 
the costs of raw materials  principally wheat  corn and vegetable oils  are largely us dollar linked and changes in the costs of these raw materials have historically been passed through to the customer in the form of higher or lower selling prices 
however  delays or difficulties in passing through changes in raw materials costs into local currency selling prices can affect our margins 
other operations 
our operations in europe are in countries that are members of the european union and several countries that are not members of the european union 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposures in those countries to minimize the financial effects of fluctuations in the euro and other european currencies 
we also operate in argentina  where we are exposed to the peso  and in asia  where our primary exposures are to the chinese yuan renminbi and the indian rupee 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposure to the financial effects of fluctuations in the values of these currencies relative to the us dollar 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes on income earned in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates ranging from to 
determination of taxable income requires the interpretation of related and often complex tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we operate and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events 
we employ various tax strategies in different tax jurisdictions that are intended to minimize net cash outflows and manage tax assets and liabilities 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
among other tax guidance  fin requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax positions 
as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  with a corresponding reduction of million in retained earnings and million in the deferred tax valuation allowance at january  at december   we had recorded tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million relates to accrued interest and penalties 
in  we merged and spun off several owned european subsidiaries which generated statutory capital tax losses and the recognition of million of net operating loss carryforwards 
we had determined that it was more likely than not that the tax authorities would disallow the recognition of the statutory capital tax losses 
consequently  in  we recorded a valuation allowance of million 
in  tax authorities conducted audits of the tax returns of the applicable entities which included the statutory capital tax losses and no additional tax assessment was made by the tax authorities 
in addition  the statute of limitations for auditing tax returns relating to the applicable returns that included the statutory capital tax losses expired on january  as a result  we reversed deferred tax valuation allowances of million in  as it was determined to be more likely than not that the net operating losses will be recovered 
the increase from the amount recorded in of million compared to the million reversed in represents the effects of foreign exchange translation adjustments 
in  we received a favorable us tax ruling with respect to the tax status of certain entities acquired in our acquisition of cereol sa cereol in we had recorded a million deferred tax liability in the opening balance sheet of cereol in  related to unremitted earnings of a subsidiary that were not considered to be permanently reinvested 
based upon the final ruling received in  we determined that the subsidiary could be liquidated without generating tax on the unremitted earnings 
as a result of receipt of the favorable us tax ruling  and in accordance with eitf issue no 
 uncertainties related to income taxes in a purchase business combination  we reduced certain indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in the cereol acquisition by million  net of deferred tax liabilities  to zero and then recognized an million non cash tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income 
in conjunction with this transaction  we incurred million of tax expense in  related to the repatriation of the post acquisition unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act 
we have in the past obtained tax benefits under us tax laws providing incentives under the provisions of the extraterritorial income act eti legislation 
however  the jobs creation act ultimately repealed the eti benefit in a gradual manner that resulted in the eti benefit being phased out completely in the eti benefit has been replaced with an income tax deduction intended to allocate benefits previously provided to us exporters across all manufacturers when fully phased in 
although most of our us operations qualify as manufacturing  we do not expect to receive significant benefits from this new tax legislation primarily due to our current us tax position 
income tax benefit in includes a charge of million relating to a correction of certain tax benefits recognized from to related to incentives under the eti provision of the us internal revenue code 
internal control over financial reporting in connection with the year end closing process  we determined that there were certain errors in our previously issued unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements  which resulted in an overstatement of net sales and costs of goods sold for the affected periods 
these errors had no effect on bunge s previously reported volumes  gross profit  segment operating profit  net income or earnings per share or on bunge s balance sheets or statements of cash flows for the affected periods 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information  including the corrected amounts 
we have determined that the identified causes of these errors represent two material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have taken  and will continue to take  actions to remediate these weaknesses 
see item a 
controls and procedures for more information 
results of operations overview our total segment operating profit was well above as a result of improved agribusiness fundamentals that increased volumes and margins in both our agribusiness and fertilizer segments 
operating profit in our edible oil and milling products segments was lower than largely as a result of higher raw material costs  impairment and restructuring charges  and increased costs related to investments for growth of our edible oils businesses in europe and asia 
agribusiness segment operating profit for was well above last year s primarily as a result of volume and margin increases 
volumes increased in almost all regions and product lines  particularly in grain origination and distribution 
oilseed processing volumes  primarily in north and south america  increased as export volumes benefited from weather related crop reductions in other regions 
these weather related crop reductions  notably in wheat production in europe and australia and corn production in europe  created major disruptions in the normal global flows of grains 
these dislocations enabled us to utilize our global asset network and our logistics assets and capabilities to supply customers from north and south america in an efficient manner 
our continuing efforts to reduce costs and improve capacity utilization led to decisions to close certain smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing facilities in the us and europe in in addition  the weaker us dollar against most major world currencies  particularly the brazilian real  had a somewhat negative impact on our results in as it increased our operating costs when translated into us dollars 
our fertilizer segment operating profit for more than doubled over with above average historical volume growth and increased margins driven by high international fertilizer and fertilizer raw material and agricultural commodity prices 
historically high commodity prices improved brazilian farm economics and encouraged both increased plantings  including a large winter corn crop  and increased fertilizer application rates to improve farm yields 
operating profit was negatively impacted in by a million increase in provisions related to recoverable taxes as law changes in certain states within brazil that take effect in have made recovery in those states uncertain 
in addition  results were somewhat reduced by the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local costs translated into us dollars 
the real appreciation also partially offset the benefit to farmers from commodity price increases 
edible oil products segment operating profit for declined from  primarily due to lagging sales prices relating to high raw material costs from the increases in crude vegetable oil prices 
operating profit was also reduced by the impact of impairment and restructuring charges related to facility closures  primarily in europe  impairment charges relating to certain brands and related intangible assets in india and increased selling  general and administrative expenses associated with growing our asian and european businesses 
operating profit in was strong in brazil  with higher packaged product volumes and good performance in procurement of raw material inventories more than offsetting lower profitability of margarines that resulted from increased competition 
operating profit was improved in north america 
volumes grew in asia and europe  but european operations suffered from difficulties in passing on historically high crude softseed oil prices to customers  increased selling  general and administrative costs to position the company for future growth  and impairment and restructuring charges 
milling products segment operating profit for declined from  as wheat milling results were negatively impacted by historically high raw material costs and by million of impairment charges due to the closure of an older  less efficient mill and increased activity at our newest mill 
a decline in wheat milling operating profit was only partially offset by improvements in corn milling operating profit that resulted from increased volumes and improved margins on us government food aid program sales 
segment results in  we reclassified certain product lines from the edible oil products segment to the agribusiness segment 
as a result  amounts for the year ended december  have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
we did not reflect the reclassification in years prior to the year ended december  as it is not practicable to do so 
a summary of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment for the periods indicated is set forth below 
year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages volumes in thousands of metric tons agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products    total    net sales agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products  total    costs of goods sold agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products  total    gross profit agribusiness  fertilizer edible oil products milling products total    selling  general and administrative expenses agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total  foreign exchange gain loss agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total interest income agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total interest expense agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total segment operating profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total  depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products total net income total segment operating profit is our consolidated income from operations before income tax that includes interest income of each segment and an allocated portion of the foreign exchange gains and losses and of interest expense relating to debt financing operating working capital  including readily marketable inventories 
total segment operating profit is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace income from operations before income tax  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
total segment operating profit is a key performance measurement used by our management to evaluate whether operating activities cover the financing costs of its business 
we believe total segment operating profit loss is a more complete measure of its operating profitability  since it allocates foreign exchange gains and losses and the cost of debt financing working capital to the appropriate operating segments 
additionally  we believe total segment operating profit assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of its portfolio of businesses before non operating factors that affect net income 
total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations before income tax or any other measure of consolidated operating results under us gaap 
below is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income tax to total segment operating profit year ended december  us in millions income from continuing operations before income tax  unallocated income expense net total segment operating profit  unallocated income expense net includes interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other income and expense not directly attributable to our operating segments 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased primarily due to historically high market prices for most agricultural commodities and commodity products in our portfolio 
volumes increased by  primarily in grain origination  as higher commodity prices led to improved farm economics  particularly in brazil  and stimulated increased plantings and farmer selling activities 
grain and oilseed distribution volumes were also higher with weather related crop reductions  particularly in oilseed  corn and wheat production in europe and wheat production in australia  creating dislocations in the normal global flows of grains and oilseeds 
these dislocations enabled us to utilize our global asset network and our logistics assets and capabilities to supply european customers from our grain and oilseed facilities in north and south america 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to historically high market prices for most agricultural commodity raw materials as well as higher ocean freight costs and the impact of a weaker us dollar  particularly against the brazilian real  on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
the average brazilian real us dollar exchange rate strengthened by in the year ended december  compared to in addition  included impairment and restructuring charges of million compared to charges of million in gross profit increased due to the increase in volumes and improved origination and processing margins 
sg a expenses increased by primarily due to increased support and administration costs for new product lines  such as sugar  information system implementations in brazil and certain european countries  increased performance based compensation costs and the impact of a weaker us dollar on foreign local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
foreign exchange gains on our net us dollar monetary liability position in brazil of million in resulted from the appreciation of the brazilian real us dollar exchange rate at december  compared to december   significantly higher notional working capital amounts resulting from higher commodity prices and increased volumes 
while the real appreciated against the us dollar in  foreign exchange losses of million for the period were primarily the result of volatility in the value of the brazilian real during the year relative to the us dollar  particularly during the second quarter of when the brazilian real devalued and brazilian agribusiness inventory levels were at their highest levels in foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory mark to market adjustments  which are included in cost of goods sold 
interest expense increased in primarily due to higher average borrowings caused by higher average working capital levels  offset partially by lower average borrowing rates 
segment operating profit increased by primarily due to higher gross profit and foreign exchange gains  partially offset by higher sg a and interest expense 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices resulting from high international fertilizer prices  particularly during the last half of the year  and a increase in volumes 
the volume increase was due primarily to higher crop prices  which improved brazilian farm economics and encouraged farmers to increase plantings and fertilizer applications to improve crop yields 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher prices of imported fertilizer raw materials used in our production processes 
costs were also higher due to the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars compared to and a million provision related to changes in value added tax vat regulations in certain brazilian states that take effect in and make the recoverability of vat tax assets in those states uncertain 
gross profit increased by primarily due to higher average selling prices that were only partially offset by higher raw material costs  which had been carried earlier in the year at lower prices 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to increased bad debt provisions  increased performance based compensation expenses and the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local costs when translated to us dollars 
foreign exchange results for included exchange gains from our program to hedge the negative impact on results of a stronger brazilian real on cost of goods sold and sg a expenses 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to increased selling prices as described above 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased due to significantly higher average selling prices and a increase in volumes 
volumes increased in most regions  with the largest increases in brazil  eastern europe and asia 
the increase in average selling prices followed the trend in agricultural commodity prices 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher raw material costs and increased volumes 
costs were also negatively impacted by the effects of a weaker us dollar on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
cost of goods sold in also included million of impairment charges relating to write downs of certain facilities in europe and the united states 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of impairment charges relating to the write down of certain refining and packaging facilities in our brazilian edible oil operations 
gross profit increased primarily due to improved profitability and higher volumes in brazilian packaged oils and in europe 
our new growth initiatives in asia also contributed to our results in in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by impairment charges 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to increases in europe and asia supporting planned growth in our edible oil operations in those regions and to million of impairment charges related to the write down of certain brands and related intangible assets in india 
expenses were also impacted by the effects of a weaker us dollar on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
segment operating profit decreased primarily due to million in impairment charges and increased sg a expenses that more than offset the increased gross profit 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices for wheat and corn milling products  combined with a modest increase in volumes 
higher average selling prices in wheat and corn milling products were primarily caused by weather related reductions in global wheat and increased consumption of corn from the us ethanol industry  as product prices generally move in relation to the cost of raw materials 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher raw material costs and million of impairment charges in relating to the closure of an older  higher cost mill 
costs were also negatively impacted by the effects of a stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
raw material cost increases were higher following the trend in wheat and corn prices 
gross profit decreased primarily due to the impairment charges in sg a increased as a result of higher labor related costs  increases in advertising expenses and the effects of a weaker us dollar on local currency costs 
segment operating profit decreased as a result of lower gross profits resulting largely from impairment charges combined with the increase in sg a 
consolidated financial costs 
the following is a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated year ended december  us in millions  except percentages change interest income interest expense foreign exchange gains interest income increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest bearing accounts receivable 
interest expense increased due to higher average borrowings resulting from increased working capital caused primarily by commodity price increases 
foreign exchange gains of million in related primarily to our us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil and were primarily due to the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real versus the us dollar at december  compared to december  foreign exchange results also included hedging gains relating to foreign exchange derivative contracts used to hedge the effects of exchange rate movements on our fertilizer segment industrial and sg a expenses in brazil 
foreign exchange gains of million in included exchange gains on our brazilian us dollar net monetary liability position primarily due to the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real versus the us dollar at december  compared to december  other income expense net 
other income expense net decreased million to million in the amount for related primarily to a gain of million from the sale of shares held in cme group  an entity created by the merger of the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade  while amounts included a gain on sale of land in europe for million 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense of million in primarily related to higher taxable earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates combined with a net increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million discussed below 
we believe that our effective tax rate has returned to a sustainable rate 
the tax benefit for of million included a million reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances and a charge of million relating to a reversal of certain tax benefits on us foreign sales recorded from to see factors affecting our operating results income taxes above and a charge of million relating to certain income tax contingencies in europe 
excluding these items  the income tax benefit was million 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
among other tax guidance  fin requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax positions 
during  we recorded an income tax expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits of million 
the increase related primarily to the appreciation of the brazilian real compared to the us dollar on amounts recorded for the possible realization of certain brazilian deferred tax assets 
we have requested a ruling on the realization of these deferred tax assets from the applicable tax authorities and expect to receive this ruling within the next months 
if the ruling is favorable  our liability related to this unrecognized tax benefit will be reversed 
minority interest 
minority interest expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to record earnings from fosfertil 
equity in earnings in affiliates 
equity in earnings of affiliates increased by million to million in from million in primarily due to a gain from our french oilseed processing joint venture related to the sale of a subsidiary and higher earnings in solae as a result of margin improvement in china and europe 
solae s earnings were low as a result of impairment and restructuring charges relating to the closure of a plant in china and employee severance costs and impairment charges relating to certain patent  technology and trademark investments in intangible assets no longer used in the business 
partially offsetting the increase from solae were lower earnings from our european biodiesel joint ventures 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in net income for includes charges for impairment and restructuring  net of tax  of million  increased value added tax provisions in our fertilizer business  net of tax and minority interest  of million and million in after tax gains from the sale of shares of stock held in cme group 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices for agricultural commodity products 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher raw material costs  freight costs  increased energy costs primarily in north america and higher operational expenses due to the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
the average brazilian us dollar exchange rate strengthened in the year ended december  compared to the same period in in addition  included impairment and restructuring charges of million and included a million decrease in allowances for recoverable taxes and a million reversal for a transactional tax provision due to a favorable tax ruling and million of impairment and restructuring charges 
gross profit was relatively unchanged primarily due to higher freight costs  increased energy costs  primarily in north america  and higher operational expenses due to the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to increases in bad debt expense and from the impact of a stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
offsetting the increase was a million reduction in sg a expenses due to a partial settlement payment we received in connection with litigation in brazil 
despite the appreciation of the brazilian real at december  compared to december   foreign exchange losses in of million were primarily the result of volatility in the value of the brazilian real during the year relative to the us dollar  particularly during the second quarter of when the brazilian real devalued and brazilian agribusiness inventory levels were at their highest levels during at december   the brazilian real had appreciated in value against the us dollar compared to values at december   resulting in exchange gains of million in foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory mark to market adjustments  which are included in cost of goods sold 
interest expense increased primarily due to higher average borrowings caused by higher average inventory levels and increases in short term interest rates 
segment operating profit decreased primarily due to lower volumes and gross profit  higher sg a expenses  foreign exchange losses and higher interest expense 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices because of lower international prices for potash partially offset by a increase in volumes 
cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower expenses resulting from the restructuring programs in brazil initiated in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by higher operating and depreciation expenses attributable to the expansion of our phosphate capacity which began production in the first quarter of  and higher costs primarily due to the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars compared to cost of goods sold in was reduced as a result of million of value added tax credits relating to taxes we paid in prior periods 
gross profit decreased by primarily due to lower average selling prices  higher operating and depreciation expenses and higher costs due to the impact of a stronger brazilian real 
sg a expenses decreased primarily due to a reversal of a brazilian social contribution tax provision of million resulting from a favorable court ruling and lower expenses resulting from a workforce reduction we made earlier in the year 
partially offsetting the decrease were higher costs due to the impact of the stronger brazilian real 
included in sg a expenses in were million of cash restructuring charges relating to a workforce reduction 
foreign exchange results for included exchange gains from our program to hedge the negative impact on results of a stronger brazilian real on cost of goods sold and sg a expenses 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to foreign exchange gains resulting from our hedging program and lower sg a expenses 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices and a increase in volumes in most regions  especially in europe 
the increase in average selling prices followed the generally higher trend in agricultural commodity prices 
the increase in volumes was largely driven by increased demand for vegetable oil used in the biodiesel industry 
our european operations also benefited from the consolidation of an acquisition in poland  which was previously accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
our brazilian operations benefited from expanded operations at one of our refining and packaging facilities 
cost of goods sold increased due to the increase in volumes  higher raw material costs and higher energy costs primarily in north america and increases in industrial costs resulting from the effects of a stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
gross profit increased primarily due to improved profitability and higher volumes in europe 
included in cost of goods sold in was million of impairment charges relating to the write down of certain refining and packaging facilities in our brazilian edible oil operations 
overall improved distribution and brand positioning also contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
sg a expenses decreased primarily due to lower advertising expenses and a receipt of a million partial settlement payment in connection with litigation in brazil partially offset by the effects of a weaker us dollar 
in  sg a expenses included million of restructuring charges relating to a workforce reduction in brazil and europe 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to improved profitability in europe and the consolidation of an acquisition in poland  which contributed million to segment operating profit in milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased primarily due to higher wheat milling product volumes and higher average selling prices for wheat and corn milling products 
increases in wheat milling product volumes to bakery and industrial customers and corn milling product volumes to commercial customers more than offset the lower corn volumes sold to the us government food aid program 
higher average selling prices in wheat and corn milling products were primarily caused by a reduction in global wheat stocks and higher corn prices in north america due to increases in demand for corn by ethanol producers 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher raw material costs and increases in industrial costs resulting from the effects of a stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
raw material cost increases were largely higher following the trend in wheat and corn prices 
gross profit increased primarily due to improved milling product margins resulting from a shift to higher margin products 
sg a expenses increased primarily due to the effects of a stronger brazilian real 
segment operating profit increased as a result of the increase in gross profit and lower financial costs 
consolidated financial costs 
the following is a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated year ended december  us in millions  except percentages change interest income interest expense foreign exchange losses interest income increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest bearing accounts receivable 
interest expense increased due to higher average borrowings and higher average interest rates on short term debt 
foreign exchange gains of million in on our us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil were primarily due to the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real versus the us dollar at december  compared to december  foreign exchange results also included hedging gains relating to foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate movements on our fertilizer segment industrial and sg a expenses in brazil 
foreign exchange losses of million in included hedging costs related to our exposure in brazil partially offset by exchange gains on our brazilian us dollar net monetary liability position primarily due to the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real versus the us dollar at december  compared to december  in addition  in  the devaluation in the value of the argentine peso versus the us dollar at december  compared to december  resulted in exchange losses on our argentine us dollar net monetary liability position 
other income expense net 
other income expense net increased million to million in from million in the amount for primarily included a gain on sale of land in europe for million and included gains on interest rate derivative contracts and gains on sales of long lived assets 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit for of million included a million reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances and a charge of million relating to a reversal of certain tax benefits on us foreign sales recorded from to see factors affecting our operating results income taxes above and a charge of million relating to certain income tax contingencies in europe 
excluding these items  the income tax benefit was million 
in  we merged and spun off several owned european subsidiaries which generated statutory capital tax losses and the recognition of million of net operating loss carryforwards 
we had determined that it was more likely than not that the tax authorities would disallow the recognition of the statutory capital tax losses 
consequently  in  we recorded a valuation allowance of million 
in  the tax authorities conducted audits of the tax returns of the applicable entities which included the statutory capital tax losses and no additional tax assessment was made by the tax authorities 
in addition  the statute of limitations for auditing tax returns relating to the applicable returns that included the statutory capital tax losses expired on january  as a result  we reversed deferred tax valuation allowances of million in as we now believe that it is more likely than not that the net operating losses will be recovered 
the increase from the amount recorded in of million compared to the million reversed in represents the effects of foreign exchange translation adjustments 
offsetting the decrease in the reversal were additional valuation allowances of million recorded in various entities relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets 
income tax benefit for of million included a million reversal of a deferred tax liability as a result of a favorable tax ruling with respect to unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary acquired see factors affecting our operating results income taxes above and a million reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances as a result of the projected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
excluding these items  the income tax expense was million 
the decrease in the valuation allowance in resulted from the projected use of net operating loss carryforwards by our brazilian subsidiaries 
we were able to recognize these net operating loss carryforwards because of the legal restructuring of our brazilian subsidiaries  increased statutory taxable income of these subsidiaries caused by the effects of the brazilian real appreciation and actions undertaken to recover the net operating loss carryforwards 
our tax planning strategies in brazil involve the use of foreign currency derivatives  optimizing the capital structure of our brazilian subsidiaries to make it more tax efficient and using us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
the decrease in the income tax expense  excluding the items noted above  was primarily due to a decline in income from operations before income tax in subsidiaries that are in tax jurisdictions with higher income tax rates 
the effects of a legal restructuring in brazil  completed in  also contributed to the lower income tax expense 
minority interest 
minority interest expense decreased million to million in from million in primarily due to lower earnings from fosfertil 
equity earnings in affiliates 
equity earnings of affiliates decreased million to million in from million in primarily due to lower earnings in solae as a result of impairment and restructuring charges relating to the closure of a plant in china  employee severance costs and impairment charges relating to certain patent  technology and trademark investments in intangible assets no longer used in the business 
partially offsetting the decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates were higher earnings from our french oilseed processing and european biodiesel joint ventures

liquidity and capital resources one of our primary financial objectives is to maintain sufficient liquidity to provide flexibility to pursue our growth strategies and ensure the smooth functioning of our existing businesses 
at december   our shareholders equity plus minority interest exceeds our long lived assets by  million  and our total debt to capitalization was 
our current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  was and at december  and december   respectively 
cash and readily marketable inventories 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and million at december  of these amounts  million and million  respectively  was held at fosfertil  a non wholly owned  publicly traded subsidiary in brazil  which is included in our consolidated financial statements 
cash and cash equivalents at fosfertil are generally not made available to reduce indebtedness incurred at other bunge companies until a dividend distribution is made by fosfertil 
included in our inventories were readily marketable inventories of  million at december  and  million at december  readily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories  which are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics  widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms 
inventories at december  increased from december  primarily due to higher agricultural commodity prices in long term and short term debt 
we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure  designed to act as our central treasury  which enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
certain of bunge limited s owned subsidiaries fund the master trust with long and short term debt obtained from third parties  including through our commercial paper program 
borrowings by these subsidiaries carry full  unconditional guarantees by bunge limited 
our short term and long term debt increased by  million at december  from december   primarily to finance higher working capital levels 
the increase in working capital was primarily caused by higher prices for agricultural commodities 
to finance working capital  we use cash flows generated from operations  short term borrowings  including our commercial paper program  borrowings under various long term bank facilities as well as proceeds from the issuance of senior notes 
generally  during periods when commodity prices are high  our operations require increased levels of working capital  which results in higher debt levels 
at december   we had approximately  million of aggregate committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities  of which  million was unused and available at december  the following table summarizes committed borrowing facilities and outstanding amounts at the period end dates specified us in millions maturities december  december  total availability december  commercial paper revolving credit facilities   total   borrowings under the revolving credit facilities whose maturities are greater than one year from the date of the consolidated balance sheets are classified as long term debt  consistent with the long term maturity of the facilities 
however  individual borrowings under the revolving credit facilities are generally short term in nature  bear interest at variable rates and can be repaid or renewed as each individual borrowing matures 
at december   we had million outstanding under our million commercial paper program  which is supported by committed back up bank credit lines of million with a number of lending institutions that are rated at least a by s p and p by moody s investor service 
in june  we extended the maturity of these committed back up bank credit lines for a five year period to june these credit lines permit bunge to  at its option  set up direct borrowings or issue commercial paper in an aggregate amount of million 
the cost of borrowing under the committed back up bank credit lines would be higher than the cost of borrowing under our commercial paper program 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under these committed back up bank credit lines 
in november  we entered into a billion  day revolving credit agreement with a number of lending institutions 
borrowings under the facility  which expires in november  are to be used for general corporate purposes 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above  from time to time we enter into uncommitted short term credit lines with lending institutions 
these credit lines are negotiated as we deem necessary based on our liquidity requirements 
at december  and december   and million  respectively  were outstanding under such short term credit lines and are included in short term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
in march  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes bearing interest at per year that mature in april senior notes due 
the senior notes due were issued by our indirect  owned finance subsidiary  bunge na finance na  and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bunge limited 
interest on the senior notes due is payable semi annually in arrears in april and october of each year  commencing in october we used the net proceeds of this offering  of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering expenses  to repay outstanding indebtedness 
through our subsidiaries  we have various other short and long term debt facilities at fixed and variable interest rates denominated in us dollars  euros  brazilian reais  and other local currencies 
a summary of these facilities is shown in the table below 
us in millions december  december  short term debt at subsidiaries long term debt at subsidiaries total certain land  property  equipment and investments in consolidated subsidiaries having a net carrying value of approximately million at december  have been mortgaged or otherwise collaterized against long term debt of million at december  in november  fitch ratings revised the outlook on the bbb credit rating of our unsecured guaranteed senior notes to stable from negative 
also in november  standard poor s ratings services s p confirmed the bbb stable outlook credit rating on our unsecured guaranteed senior notes 
in addition  our unsecured guaranteed senior notes carry a rating of baa with a negative outlook from moody s investor service 
our debt agreements do not have any credit ratings downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
however  credit rating downgrades would increase our borrowing costs under our credit facilities and  depending on their severity  could affect our ability to renew existing or to obtain new credit facilities or access the capital markets in the future on favorable terms 
we may also be required to post collateral or provide third party credit support under certain agreements as a result of such downgrades 
a significant increase in our borrowing costs could impair our ability to compete effectively in our business relative to competitors with lower amounts of indebtedness and or higher credit ratings 
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth  minimum current ratio  a maximum debt to capitalization ratio and indebtedness at the subsidiary level 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had various interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of  million for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate senior notes 
under the terms of interest rate swaps  we make payments based on six month libor and we receive payments based on the fixed rates of the associated senior notes 
the maturity of the interest rate swap agreements correspond with the maturity of the associated fixed rate senior notes 
in  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million maturing in april and a notional amount of million maturing in may for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure associated with the senior notes due and million of the million principal amount of our senior notes due  respectively 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we will make payments based on six month libor and will receive payments based on fixed interest rates 
we have accounted for these interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

during  we also terminated certain interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million and million maturing in and  respectively 
as a result of the swap terminations  we realized a net settlement loss of approximately million that was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
this settlement loss will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the associated debt instruments 
in january  we terminated our outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of  million maturing in  and and received approximately million in cash  which was comprised of million of accrued interest and a million gain on the net settlement of the swap agreements 
the million of accrued interest was recognized in as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statement of income and million of the gain was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december  the million gain will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the debt 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity increased to  million at december  from  million at december   as a result of net income of million  million received from the sale of preference shares  million from the issuance of our common shares relating to the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of restricted stock units that had vested  million related to stock based compensation expense  and other comprehensive income of million  which includes foreign exchange translation gains of million 
this increase was partially offset by million relating to the initial adoption of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  dividends paid to common shareholders of million and accrued dividends to preference shareholders of million during the year ended december  in november  we sold  shares of cumulative mandatory convertible preference shares in a public offering  for which we received net proceeds of approximately million after underwriting discounts and commissions  which was used to repay indebtedness 
the annual dividend on each mandatory convertible preference share will be and will be payable quarterly 
each mandatory convertible preference share has an initial liquidation preference of  which will be adjusted for any accumulated and unpaid dividends 
each mandatory convertible preference share will automatically convert on december   into between and bunge limited common shares 
each mandatory convertible preference share is also convertible at any time before december   at the holder s option  into bunge limited common shares 
the conversion rates are subject to anti dilution adjustments 
cash flows compared to in  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million  reflecting the net impact of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to an million increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance in our operating activities used cash of million in  compared to cash used of million in our cash flow from operations varies depending on the timing of the acquisition of  and the market prices for  agribusiness commodity inventories and the existence of a positive carrying structure in the market for agricultural commodities  which encourages commodity merchandisers to hold inventories 
the decrease in the cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to higher levels of working capital 
the higher levels of working capital are primarily attributable to an increase in readily marketable commodity inventories and trade accounts receivable partially offset by increased accounts payable resulting from higher commodity prices and increased purchases in north and south america and europe 
generally  during periods when commodity prices are high  our operations require increased levels of working capital and our customers will  in many cases  reduce the volume of agricultural commodity forward sales contracts with us in anticipation that prices will decline 
as a result  we are dependent on exchange traded futures to minimize the effects of changes in the prices of agricultural commodities on our agribusiness inventories and agricultural forward purchase contracts 
typically  futures exchanges require daily settlements on outstanding futures positions 
as a result of the rising prices of agricultural commodities  we have experienced significant cash payment obligations required to settle our daily outstanding net futures positions 
historically  our operating activities use cash in the first half of the year due to purchases of the south american harvest  which occurs in march  april and may 
in addition  in the first half of the year we also build fertilizer inventories in anticipation of sales to farmers who typically purchase the bulk of their fertilizer needs in the second half of the year 
also during the first half of the year  north american and european old crop inventories harvested and purchased in september  october and november of the previous year are at their lowest level 
our operating activities have historically provided cash flow in the second half of the year  but they can vary depending upon the amount of advances made to farmers in brazil and the amount of north american and european new crops purchased during the september  october and november harvest periods 
in addition  most of the south american inventories acquired during the march  april and may harvest period have been sold 
for the years ended december  and  the foreign exchange gain on debt was million and million  respectively  and these were included as an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash used in operating activities in the line item foreign exchange gain on debt in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our brazilian subsidiaries are primarily funded with intercompany  us dollar denominated debt 
the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiaries is the local currency  the brazilian real 
these us dollar denominated intercompany loans are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates at the applicable balance sheet date 
the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain or loss 
however  foreign exchange gains or losses on these us dollar denominated intercompany loans do not impact our cash flows from operating activities  but are included as an adjustment to reconcile net income to cash used for provided by operating activities 
cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to cash used of million in payments made for capital expenditures included investments in property  plant and equipment totaling million and consisted primarily of additions under our capital expenditure plan 
capital expenditures in related to replacement of existing equipment in order to maintain current production capacity  efficiency improvements to reduce costs  equipment upgrades and business expansion

cash provided by financing activities was  million in  compared to cash provided of million in in and  we increased our borrowings by million and million  respectively  primarily to finance our working capital requirements 
we also received net proceeds of million and million from the issuance of convertible preference shares in and  respectively 
dividends paid to our common shareholders in were million and million in dividends paid to holders of our convertible preference shares were million in compared to in  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million  reflecting the net impact of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to a million decrease in our cash and cash equivalents balance in our operating activities used cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in the decrease in the cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to higher levels of working capital 
the higher levels of working capital is primarily attributable to higher soybean purchases in the united states and brazil and a positive carrying structure in the market for agricultural commodities 
cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to cash used of million in payments made for capital expenditures included investments in property  plant and equipment that totaled million and consisted primarily of additions under our normal capital expenditure plan

cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to cash provided of million in in  we increased our borrowings by million  and we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible preference shares 
dividends paid to our common shareholders in were million and million in brazilian farmer credit fertilizer segment accounts receivable 
in our fertilizer segment  customer accounts receivable typically have repayment terms of up to days 
the actual due dates are individually determined based upon when a farmer purchases our fertilizer and the anticipated date for the harvest and sale of the farmer s crop  as the farmer s cash flow is seasonal and is typically generated after the crop is harvested 
the payment terms for these accounts receivable are often renegotiated if there is a crop failure or the cash flows generated from the harvest are not adequate for the farmer to repay balances due to us 
brazilian farm economics in and were adversely affected by volatility in soybean prices  poor crop quality and yields in certain regions and a steadily appreciating brazilian real 
certain brazilian farmers responded to these conditions by delaying payment on outstanding amounts owed to farm input suppliers 
higher crop prices in  driven partially by anticipated demand increases for corn and vegetable oils to support growing food and biofuels demand and by certain global production shortfalls in wheat  corn and oilseeds  have contributed to an improvement in brazilian farm economics 
however  some brazilian farmers continue to face high unpaid debt balances and a strong brazilian real 
in addition  crop input prices were significantly higher in than as a result of these factors and our review of individual accounts receivable balances  we have increased our allowance for doubtful accounts in the fertilizer segment 
while we expect farm economics in brazil to continue to improve  the recovery process for some farmers will likely extend beyond one crop cycle 
below is a table of our fertilizer segment current and non current trade accounts receivable balances and the related allowances for doubtful accounts as of the dates indicated december  us in millions  except percentages trade accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and record allowances for doubtful accounts if we determine that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance on analyses of credit quality for specific accounts  considering also the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in brazil and will adjust this allowance in the future depending upon changes in circumstances 
in addition  we have tightened our credit policies to reduce exposure to higher risk accounts and we have increased our collateral requirements for certain customers 
based on our collectibility evaluation during  we reclassified million of certain accounts receivable from trade accounts receivable to other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
this reclassification reflects the non current portion of outstanding trade receivables that have been renegotiated with farmers 
as of december   the balance of the non current accounts receivable was million and the related non current allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
in addition to our fertilizer trade accounts receivable  we issue guarantees to financial institutions in brazil relating to amounts owed the institutions by certain of our customers 
related amounts totaled million at december  the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financing arrangements  which can range from days to five years 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to the institutions and we would be required to perform under the guarantees  we have obtained collateral from the customers 
at december   million of these financing arrangements were collateralized by tangible property 
we evaluate the likelihood of the customer repayments of the amounts due to financial institutions and we record an obligation if we determine collection is doubtful 
during  we paid million to the financial institutions as a result of customer defaults on the amounts they owe to the institutions 
included in total trade accounts receivable of million at december  were partially collateralized non current accounts receivable of million relating to customer defaults under this program that occurred primarily in and for which we have related reserves for doubtful accounts of million 
secured advances to farmers and suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts  specifically with prepayments in advance of crop deliveries  and secured advances to farmers in brazil 
these financing arrangements are typically secured by the farmer s future crop and mortgages on the farmer s land and other assets and are generally settled after the farmer s crop is harvested and sold 
at december   we had  million in outstanding prepaid commodity purchase contracts and secured advances to farmers in brazil compared to million at december  the increase in the balance resulted primarily from higher farmer crop input costs 
the allowance for uncollectible advances totaled million at december  and million at december  we closely monitor the collectibility of these advances 
against these outstanding balances owed to us  we also had million and million  as of december  and december   respectively  recorded as accounts payable to these farmers reflecting soybeans which had been delivered by the farmers to our facilities 
interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of million  million and million for  and  respectively  is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income 
included in the outstanding balances for prepaid commodity purchase contracts and secured advances to farmers at december  and december  were long term secured advances to suppliers of million and million  respectively 
we extend secured advances to suppliers on a long term basis as brazilian producers increase acreage used for the production of agricultural commodities 
these advances are used by our suppliers to invest in the cultivation of newly converted land and other supplies needed for the production of agricultural commodities 
often these new production areas will take two to three years to reach normal yields 
the repayment terms of our long term secured advances to suppliers generally range from two to three years 
this program is intended to assure the future supply of agricultural commodities from the increased acreage 
included in the long term secured advances to suppliers are advances that were renegotiated from their original terms  equal to an aggregate of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these renegotiated advances are generally collateralized by a farmer s future crops and a mortgage on such farmer s land  buildings and equipment 
also included in long term secured advances to suppliers are advances for which we have initiated legal action to collect the outstanding balance  equal to an aggregate of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
collections being pursued through legal action largely reflect loans made for the and crops 
capital expenditures our cash payments made for capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in in  major capital projects included the expansion of oilseed processing capabilities and construction of a new refinery in canada  continued construction of port facilities in brazil  expansion of brazilian phosphate rock production capacity and a new wheat mill  and expansion of our sugar production facility in brazil

in  major capital projects included the expansion of our brazilian fertilizer blending  sulfuric and phosphoric acid production capacity  investments in export terminal operations in brazil and argentina  expansion of our oilseed processing capabilities and port facilities in spain and eastern europe  and expansion of oilseed processing and grain origination capabilities in russia and ukraine 
we intend to invest approximately  million to  million in  net of cash received on asset dispositions 
of this amount  we expect that approximately will be used for sustaining current production capacity  safety and environmental programs 
the other investments will be used to expand our sugar business  build new plants and improve oilseed processing logistics and plant operating efficiencies in europe  expand and upgrade our mining  fertilizer production capacity and port facilities in the united states and brazil  expand or acquire grain origination facilities in europe and modernize certain of our edible oil refineries in canada and europe

the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us 
the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products 
however  changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities 
represents estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to an agreement between us and a third party  we were granted an option to purchase and the third party was granted an option to sell to us  a grain shipping terminal in europe for million 
this option could be exercised by either party at specified time periods beginning in may in the second quarter of  both we and the third party gave notice of our intentions to exercise the options 
however  the parties are in dispute regarding certain terms of the transfer of the terminal and the implementation of the transfer 
we have initiated arbitration proceedings to clarify such matters 
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our post retirement healthcare benefit plans in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report on form k 
allowances for uncollectible accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers and record allowances for uncollectible accounts if we have determined that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts on historical experience  market conditions  current trends and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could result in additional provisions to the allowance for uncollectible accounts and an increase in bad debt expense 
at december   our allowances for uncollectible current and non current trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers were million and million  respectively 
at december   our allowances for uncollectible current and non current trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers were million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
management s assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments 
at december  and  the allowance for recoverable taxes was million and million  respectively 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 
inventories and derivatives to the extent we consider it prudent for minimizing risk  we use derivative instrument contracts for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with agricultural commodity prices  energy and ocean freight costs  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we are exposed to loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties to these contracts 
the risk of non performance is routinely monitored and provisions recorded  if necessary  to account for potential non performance 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these contracts could result in additional provisions and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold  foreign exchange or interest expense 
we did not have significant allowances relating to non performance by counterparties at december  and the majority of our merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories  forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts are valued at estimated market values 
these merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded  have quoted market prices and may be sold without significant additional processing 
we estimate market values based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in the market values of these inventories and contracts are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of goods sold 
if we used different methods or factors to estimate market values  amounts reported as inventories and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in the consolidated balance sheets and cost of goods sold could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories  unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and cost of goods sold could differ 
property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property  plant and equipment assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of property  plant and equipment assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our property  plant and equipment assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
in  we recorded pretax impairment charges of million  million  and million in our agribusiness  edible oil products and milling products segments  respectively  relating to write downs of smaller  older and less efficient facilities 
these included four oilseed processing  refining and packaging facilities in europe  an oilseed processing facility and an edible oil products packaging facility in the united states  one wheat milling facility in brazil and one corn milling facility in canada 
the declining results of operations of these facilities  as well as our additions of new  larger and better located facilities in recent years  led management to reach a decision to permanently close all or substantial portions of these facilities 
in addition to the facility impairments  pretax impairment charges included million impairments related to certain brands and other intangible assets in india as a result of declining returns on those assets 
in  we recorded pretax impairment charges of million and million in our agribusiness and edible oil products segments  respectively  relating to write downs of three smaller  older and less efficient oilseed processing  refining and packaging facilities  in brazil 
declining results of operations at these facilities  which resulted from adverse operating conditions in the brazilian agribusiness industry  competition from argentina and the strength of the brazilian currency  led management to permanently close these three facilities 
in  we recorded pretax impairment charges in our agribusiness segment of million relating to certain south american oilseed processing facilities  which have been closed due to a deteriorating operating environment caused by industry over capacity  and million relating to an oilseed processing plant in india 
investments in affiliates we continually review our equity investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time that the fair value of the investment is less than our carrying value  the financial condition  operating performance and near term prospects of the investment  which include general market conditions specific to the investment or the industry in which it operates  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in fair value 
we did not have any significant impairment charges relating to our equity investments in  and goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the costs of businesses acquired over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recovery of goodwill  projections regarding estimated discounted future cash flows  market place data and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the reporting units and the respective assets 
our reporting units  which are our operating segments  in which we have recorded goodwill  are agribusiness  edible oil products and milling products 
these projections are based on historical data  anticipated market conditions and management plans 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and recognized a million impairment of goodwill related to our packaged oil brands in europe and asia in the edible oils product segment 
the impairments were a result of a decline in the market conditions in asia and our continued business realignment in europe 
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  please see item legal proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various us and foreign pension and post retirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and post retirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate on our defined benefit pension plans would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily representing the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
in  we merged and spun off several owned european subsidiaries which generated statutory capital tax losses and the recognition of million of net operating loss carryforwards 
we had determined that it was more likely than not that the tax authorities would disallow the recognition of the statutory capital tax losses 
consequently  in  we recorded a valuation allowance of million 
in  the tax authorities conducted audits of the tax returns of the applicable entities  which included the statutory capital tax losses  and no additional tax assessments were made by the tax authorities 
in addition  the statute of limitations for auditing the tax returns relating to the applicable returns that included the statutory capital tax losses expired on january  as a result  in  we reversed deferred tax valuation allowances of million  as we now believe that it is more likely than not that the net operating losses will be recovered 
the increase from the amount recorded in of million compared to million reversed in represents the effects of foreign exchange translation adjustments 
offsetting the decrease in the reversal were additional valuation allowances of million recorded in various entities relating to the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
in  we decreased the valuation by million as a result of the projected utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by our brazilian subsidiaries 
we were able to recognize these net operating loss carryforwards because of the legal restructuring of our brazilian subsidiaries  increased statutory taxable income of these subsidiaries caused by the effects of the real appreciation and actions undertaken to recover the net operating loss carryforwards 
our tax planning strategies in brazil involve the use of foreign currency derivatives  optimizing the capital structure of our brazilian subsidiaries to make it more tax efficient and using us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax benefits 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
at december   we had recorded tax liabilities of million in our consolidated balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements adoption of new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued two related standards that address accounting for income taxes  fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and fsp fas  accounting for a change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction fsp fas

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices  transportation costs  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  those fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
while the hedging positions are intended to minimize the volatility on operating profits  occasionally the hedging activity can result in earnings volatility  some of which may be material 
the counter parties to these contractual arrangements are primarily major financial institutions or  in the case of commodity futures and options  a commodity exchange 
certain hedges are executed through the over the counter market and related counterparty exposure is managed through credit analysis and review by a credit committee 
as a result  credit risk arising from these contracts is not significant and we do not anticipate any significant losses 
our board of directors finance and risk policy committee supervises  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and risk limits 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry  from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products 
as a result  we purchase and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  sunflower seed  rapeseed or canola  wheat and corn 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
we are also subject to the risk of counter party defaults under forward purchase or sale contracts 
we enter into various derivative contracts  primarily exchange traded futures  with the objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are a combination of quantity and value at risk limits 
we measure and review our net commodities position on a daily basis 
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  related purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded contracts  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing each net position at quoted average futures prices for the period 
value at risk is calculated on the net position and monitored at the and confidence intervals 
in addition  scenario analysis is performed on the portfolio 
for example  one measure of market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position ocean freight risk ocean freight represents a significant portion of our operating costs 
the market price for ocean freight varies depending on the supply and demand for ocean vessels  global economic conditions and other factors 
we enter into time charter agreements for time on ocean freight vessels based on forecasted requirements for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
our time charter agreements have terms ranging from two months to five years 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge portions of our ocean freight costs 
the ocean freight derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
a substantial portion of the ocean freight derivatives have been designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities of our unrecognized firm commitment to purchase time on ocean freight vessels 
changes in the fair value of the ocean freight derivatives that are qualified  designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge  along with the gain or loss on the hedged firm commitment to purchase time on ocean freight vessels that is attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income million of gains on the firm commitments to purchase time on ocean freight vessels  which were offset by million of losses on freight derivative contracts 
there was no material gain or loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income for due to hedge ineffectiveness 
currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we follow a policy of hedging monetary assets and liabilities and commercial transactions with foreign currency exposure 
our primary exposure is related to our subsidiaries located in brazil and europe and to a lesser extent  argentina  canada and asia 
we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward contracts and swaps  and to a lesser extent  foreign currency options  to limit exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and our local currency operating expenses 
we may also hedge other foreign currency exposures as deemed appropriate 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the balance of permanently invested intercompany borrowings was  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange gains of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
for risk management purposes and to determine the overall level of hedging required  we further reduce the foreign exchange exposure determined above by the value of our agricultural commodities inventories 
our agricultural commodities inventories  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provide a natural hedge to our currency exposure 
our net currency positions  including currency derivatives  and our market risk  which is the potential loss from an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  are set forth in the following table 
in addition  we have provided an analysis of our foreign currency exposure after reducing the exposure for our agricultural commodities inventories 
actual results may differ from the information set forth below 
us in millions december  december  brazilian operations primarily exposure to us dollar net currency short position  from financial instruments  including derivatives   market risk agricultural commodities inventories   net currency short position  less agricultural commodities inventories market risk argentine operations primarily exposure to us dollar net currency short position  from financial instruments  including derivatives market risk agricultural commodities inventories net currency long position  less agricultural commodities inventories market risk european operations primarily exposure to us dollar net currency short position  from financial instruments  including derivatives market risk agricultural commodities inventories net currency long short position  less agricultural commodities inventories market risk the market risk for the brazilian operations excludes fertilizer inventories of million at december   which also provide a natural hedge to our currency exposure 
including the market fertilizer inventories reduces the net currency to a long position  less agricultural commodities inventories at december  of million 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our brazilian fertilizer segment results 
we use net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustments arising from remeasuring our investment in the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of our brazilian subsidiaries 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges  we record the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at december   we had outstanding cross currency swaps with a notional value of million to hedge our net investment in brazilian assets 
we pay brazilian reais and receive us dollars using fixed interest rates  offsetting the translation adjustment of our net investment in brazilian reais assets 
these swaps have maturity dates in at december   the fair value of these currency swaps was a loss of million  which was recorded in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognized a loss of million on the change in fair value on our outstanding net investment hedge and a loss of million on the settlement of certain other net investment hedges for the year ended december   which were included as an offset against foreign exchange translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
interest rate risk we issue debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the following table summarizes our total short term and long term debt exposure to interest rate risk at december  variable rate debt fixed rate debt total us in millions a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest rates of our debt at december  would result in a decrease in the fair value of our debt of approximately million 
similarly  a decrease of basis points in the interest rates of our debt at december  would cause an increase in the fair value of our debt of approximately million 
in addition  a hypothetical change in the libor interest rates would result in a change in our interest expense of approximately million 
the calculation assumes that all long term debt maturing within one year is variable rate debt in addition to the debt that carries a variable interest rate 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and is indexed to non us dollar based interest rate indices  such as euribor and tjlp 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the impact from any currency movements 
interest rate derivatives we use various derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with outstanding or forecasted fixed and variable rate debt and debt issuances  including interest rate swaps  options  and futures as may be required 
the interest rate swaps used by us as derivative hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in sfas no 
 is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
the derivatives we entered into for hedge purposes are assumed to be perfectly effective under the shortcut method of sfas no 
the differential to be paid or received based on changes in interest rates is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the interest rate differential on the swaps settles in cash every six months until expiration 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million maturing in and a notional amount of million maturing in for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure associated with the senior notes due see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and million of the million principal amount of senior notes due  respectively 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  we make payments based on six month libor and receive payments based on fixed interest rates 
we have accounted for the interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
in  we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million and million maturing in and  respectively 
as a result of these swap terminations  we realized a net settlement loss of approximately million that was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt in the consolidated balance sheet 
this settlement loss will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the associated debt instruments 
the following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges as of december  fair value gain december  maturity us in millions total receive fixed pay variable notional amount weighted average variable rate payable weighted average fixed rate receivable interest is payable in arrears based on a six month libor plus a spread 
we recognized approximately million  million and million as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income in the years ended december   and  respectively  relating to our outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  in  and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income  related to the termination of interest rate swap gains 
in january  we terminated our outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of  million maturing in  and  and received approximately million in cash  which was comprised of million of accrued interest and a million gain on the net settlement of the swap agreements 
the million of accrued interest was recognized in as a reduction of interest expense in the consolidated statement of income and million of the gain was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december  the million gain will be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the debt
