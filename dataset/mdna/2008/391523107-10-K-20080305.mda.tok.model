construction on the resort began in october with expected completion in spring industry trends 
we operate in the family entertainment resort segment of the travel and leisure industry 
the concept of a family entertainment resort with an indoor waterpark was first introduced to the united states in wisconsin dells  wisconsin  and has evolved there over the past years 
in an effort to boost occupancy and daily rates  as well as capture off season demand  hotel operators in the wisconsin dells market began expanding indoor pools and adding waterslides and other water based attractions to existing hotels and resorts 
the success of these efforts prompted several local operators to build new  larger destination resorts based primarily on the concept 
we believe that these properties  which typically are themed and include other resort features such as arcades  retail shops and full food and beverage service in addition to the indoor waterpark  have historically outperformed standard hotels in the market 
we believe that the rate premiums and increased market share in the wisconsin dells for hotels and resorts with some form of an indoor waterpark can be attributed to several factors  including the ability to provide a year round vacation destination without weather related risks  the wide appeal of water based recreation and the favorable trends in leisure travel discussed below 
while no standard industry definition for a family entertainment resort featuring an indoor waterpark has developed  we generally consider resorts with at least rooms featuring indoor waterparks larger than  square feet  as well as a variety of water slides and other water based attractions  to be competitive with our resorts 
a recent hotel leisure advisors  llc h la survey indicates that the number of indoor waterpark destination resorts has grown from available properties as of year end to available properties as of january the same survey indicated new indoor waterpark projects currently projected to open in we believe recent vacation trends favor drive to family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks  as the number of families choosing to take shorter  more frequent vacations that they can drive to have increased in recent years 
we believe that these trends will continue 
we believe indoor waterpark resorts are generally less affected by changes in economic cycles  as drive to destinations are less expensive and more convenient than destinations that require air travel 
outlook 
we believe that no other operator or developer other than us has established a portfolio of family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks 
we intend to continue to expand our portfolio of owned resorts throughout the united states and to selectively seek licensing and management opportunities domestically and internationally 
the resorts we are currently constructing and plan to develop in the future require significant industry knowledge and substantial capital resources 
similar family entertainment resorts compete directly with several of our resorts 
our primary business objective is to increase long term stockholder value 
we believe we can increase stockholder value by executing our internal and external growth strategies 
our primary internal growth strategies are to maximize total resort revenue  minimize costs by leveraging our economies of scale  and build upon our existing brand awareness and loyalty in order to compete more effectively 
our primary external growth strategies are to capitalize on our first mover advantage by being the first to develop and operate family entertainment resorts featuring indoor waterparks in our selected target markets  focus on development and strategic growth opportunities by seeking to develop additional resorts and target selected licensing and joint venture opportunities  and continue to innovate by leveraging our in house expertise  in conjunction with the knowledge and experience of our third party suppliers and designers 

table of contents in attempting to execute our internal and external growth strategies  we are subject to a variety of business challenges and risks 
these challenges include development and licensing of properties  increases in costs of constructing  operating and maintaining our resorts  competition from other entertainment companies  both within and outside our industry segment  and external economic risks  including family vacation patterns and trends 
we seek to meet these challenges by providing sufficient management oversight to site selection  development and resort operations  concentrating on growing and strengthening awareness of our brand and demand for our resorts  and maintaining our focus on safety 
we believe that our traverse city and sandusky resorts have been and will continue to be affected by adverse general economic circumstances in the michigan northern ohio region such as bankruptcies of several major companies and or large announced layoffs by major employers and increased competition that has occurred in these markets over the past three years 
the michigan northern ohio region includes cities that have historically been the traverse city and sandusky resorts largest suppliers of customers 
we believe the adverse general economic circumstances in the region have negatively impacted overall discretionary consumer spending in that region over the past year and may continue to do so going forward 
we believe this has and may continue to have an impact on the operating performance of our traverse city and sandusky resorts 
also  we have experienced a much slower than expected occupancy ramp up and lower than expected average daily room rates at our sheboygan  wisconsin property since its opening in we believe this operating weakness has been primarily attributable to the fact that the overall development of sheboygan as a tourist destination continues to lag behind our initial expectations 
we believe this has impacted and will likely continue to impact the consumer demand for our indoor waterpark resort in that market and the operations of the resort 
additionally  our mason resort opened its first phase in december and is ramping up more slowly than we had projected  which we believe is due  in part  to the opening of competitive properties in the region and to negative publicity from operating issues at the resort in our external growth strategies are based primarily on developing additional indoor waterpark resorts by ourselves either alone or in conjunction with joint venture partners or by others in a licensing situation 
developing resorts of the size and scope of our family entertainment resorts generally requires obtaining financing for a significant portion of a project s expected construction costs 
the subprime loan crisis that began in has precipitated a general tightening in us lending markets and decreased the overall availability of construction financing to us and other parties 
although the ultimate effect on our external growth strategy of the current credit environment is difficult to predict with certainty  we believe that the availability to us of construction financing may be lessened in the future and that terms of construction financing may be less favorable than we have seen over the past few years 
although we believe we can continue to obtain construction financing sufficient to execute our development strategies  we believe the more difficult credit market environment is likely to continue through and possibly beyond 
revenue and key performance indicators 
we seek to generate positive cash flows and maximize our return on invested capital from each of our owned resorts 
our rooms revenue represents sales to guests of room nights at our resorts and is the largest contributor to our cash flows and profitability 
rooms revenue accounted for approximately of our total resort revenue for the year ended december  we employ sales and marketing efforts to increase overall demand for rooms at our resorts 
we seek to optimize the relationship between room rates and occupancies through the use of yield management techniques that attempt to project demand in order to selectively increase room rates during peak demand 
these techniques are designed to assist us in managing our higher occupancy nights to achieve maximum rooms revenue and include such practices as monitoring our historical trends for occupancy and estimating our high occupancy nights  offering the highest discounts to previous guests in off peak periods to build customer loyalty and enhance our ability to charge higher rates in peak periods  structuring rates to allow us to offer our previous guests the best rate while simultaneously working with a promotional partner or offering internet specials  monitoring sales of room types daily to evaluate the effectiveness of offered discounts  and 
table of contents offering specials on standard suites and yielding better rates on larger suites when standard suites sell out 
in addition  we seek to maximize the amount of time and money spent on site by our guests by providing a variety of revenue generating amenities 
we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these indicators include the following occupancy  average daily room rate  or adr  revenue per available room  or revpar  total revenue per available room  or total revpar  total revenue per occupied room  or total revpor  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hospitality industry to evaluate hotel operations and are defined as follows occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms by total available rooms 
adr is calculated by dividing total rooms revenue by total occupied rooms 
revpar is the product of occupancy and adr 
total revpar and total revpor are defined as follows total revpar is calculated by dividing total revenue by total available rooms 
total revpor is calculated by dividing total revenue by total occupied rooms 
occupancy allows us to measure the general overall demand for rooms at our resorts and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategies 
adr allows us to measure the effectiveness of our yield management strategies 
while adr and revpar only include rooms revenue  total revpor and total revpar include both rooms revenue and other revenue derived from food and beverage and other amenities at our resorts 
we consider total revpor and total revpar to be key performance indicators for our business because we derive a significant portion of our revenue from food and beverage and other amenities 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total resort revenues consisted of non rooms revenue 
we use revpar and total revpar to evaluate the blended effect that changes in occupancy  adr and total revpor have on our profitability 
we focus on increasing adr and total revpor because we believe those increases can have the greatest positive impact on our profitability 
in addition  we seek to maximize occupancy  as increases in occupancy generally lead to greater total revenues at our resorts  and we believe maintaining certain occupancy levels is key to covering our fixed costs 
increases in total revenues as a result of higher occupancy are  however  typically accompanied by additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
in contrast  increases in total revenues from higher adr and total revpor are typically accompanied by lower incremental costs and result  generally  in a greater increase in profitability 
we also use ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of each of our resorts 
ebitda is a supplemental financial measure and is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
see non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of our use of ebitda and a reconciliation to net income 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process involve the use of accounting estimates based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from our current judgments 
investments in property and equipment 
we record investments in property and equipment at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years fixtures and equipment  including waterpark equipment years we are required to make subjective assessments as to these useful lives for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record annually with respect to our investments in property and equipment 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in property and equipment we would depreciate and amortize such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation and amortization expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we have assigned to our depreciable assets to determine whether those useful lives are reasonable and appropriate 
when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate the carrying values of a long lived asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges from the expected future operations of the asset 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  operating trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
carrying values of goodwill  intangible assets and investment in related parties 
as a result of the formation transactions  we recorded on our consolidated balance sheet approximately  of goodwill and  of intangible assets related to our great wolf lodge brand name 
the brand name intangible asset has an indefinite life 
in we removed  of goodwill in conjunction with the sale of interests in our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
the carrying value of our interest in the joint venture that now owns the wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts is  as of december  in we removed  of goodwill on our traverse city and blue harbor resorts as the implied fair value of the goodwill  as discussed below  was deemed less than the carrying value 
the carrying value of our interest in our joint venture that owns the great wolf lodge under construction in grand mound is  as of december  we are required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
to test goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of the individual resort to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of that resort 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the individual resort  we compare the implied fair value of the resort s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the individual resort to all the assets and liabilities of that resort as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the assessment date 
the excess of the fair value of the individual resort over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
our assessment of the fair value is dependent on the operating results of the resorts 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging 
table of contents industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of goodwill 
when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying real estate assets could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these intangibles 
when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that the carrying value of our investments in related parties may be impaired  we perform an analysis to review the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
to test investment in related parties for impairment  we compare the fair value of the investment in related parties with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the investment in related parties is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses  which reduce net income 
future adverse changes in the hospitality and lodging industry  market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investments could result in future losses or the inability to recover the carrying value of these assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
conversely  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  we would establish a valuation allowance which would increase the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
these federal and state carryforwards begin expiring in and  respectively 
we believe all but  of the net operating loss carryforwards will be realized  therefore we have established a valuation as of december  of  which is the tax effected amount of the operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance is included on the balance sheet in deferred tax liability 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation 
table of contents also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various states and foreign jurisdictions 
all of the tax years since the date of our ipo are open in all jurisdictions 
our policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense 
we believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  the adoption of fin did not impact the consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at january   we had unrecognized tax benefits of  which primarily related to uncertainty regarding the sustainability of certain deductions taken on our and us federal income tax return related to transaction costs from our ipo 
to the extent the unrecognized tax benefits of  at december  are ultimately recognized  they will impact the effective tax rate in a future period 
we do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next year 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the provisions of this statement are required to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate electing the option to fair value financial assets or financial liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for a non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of the new income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement 

table of contents non gaap financial measures we use ebitda as a measure of our operating performance 
ebitda is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is commonly defined as net income plus a net interest expense  b income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
ebitda as calculated by us is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
in addition  ebitda a does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  b is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash flow needs  and c should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or our other financial information as determined under gaap 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because a significant portion of our assets consists of property and equipment that are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in accordance with gaap 
because depreciation and amortization are non cash items  we believe that presentation of ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance  it is widely used in the hospitality and entertainment industries to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  and we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of items directly resulting from our asset base  primarily depreciation and amortization  from our operating results  for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget  as a valuation measure for evaluating our operating performance and our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business  and as one measure in determining the value of other acquisitions and dispositions 
using a measure such as ebitda has material limitations 
these limitations include the difficulty associated with comparing results among companies and the inability to analyze certain significant items  including depreciation and interest expense  which directly affect our net income or loss 
management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently  as well as in connection with its analysis of net income

future maturities future principal requirements on long term debt are as follows thereafter total short term liquidity requirements our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses for the next months  including recurring maintenance  repairs and other operating expenses necessary to properly maintain and operate our resorts  property taxes and insurance expenses  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  general and administrative expenses  and income taxes 

table of contents historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows and cash on hand 
we believe that cash provided by our operations  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the next months 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the following items for periods beyond the next months scheduled debt maturities  costs associated with the development of new resorts  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our resorts  and capital contributions and loans to unconsolidated joint ventures 
we expect to meet these needs through existing working capital  cash provided by operations  proceeds from investing activities  including sales of partial or whole ownership interests in certain of our resorts  and proceeds from financing activities  including mortgage financing on properties being developed  additional borrowings under future credit facilities  contributions from joint venture partners  and the issuance of equity instruments  including common stock  or additional or replacement debt  as market conditions permit 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
our mason mortgage loan in the amount of  matures in december the loan has two  one year extensions available at our option  assuming the property meets an operating performance threshold 
we do not expect the property to meet the operating performance threshold at december accordingly  we have begun discussions with the lender on obtaining a waiver or modification of this performance threshold  in order to exercise the one year extension at december we expect to obtain a waiver or modification allowing us to exercise the one year extension prior to the loan s maturity date in december also  in february we closed on a  mortgage loan secured by our williamsburg resort 
that loan has a one year term 
prior to the loan s maturity in february  we expect to either extend it or refinance it into a larger  longer term  fixed rate loan 
our largest long term expenditures are expected to be for capital expenditures  development of future resorts and capital contributions or loans to joint ventures owning resorts under construction or development 
such expenditures were  for the year ended december  we expect to have approximately  of such expenditures in and  in as discussed above  we expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  cash on hand  contributions from new joint venture partners  proceeds from investing activities and proceeds from financing activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we have two unconsolidated joint venture arrangements at december  we account for our unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
our joint venture with cnl income properties  inc cnl owns two resorts  great wolf lodge wisconsin dells  wisconsin and great wolf lodge sandusky  ohio 
we are a limited partner with a ownership interest in the cnl joint venture 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of  this loan is a mortgage loan that is non recourse to us

table of contents washington 
this resort is currently under construction and is expected to open in march this joint venture is a limited liability company  we are a member of that limited liability company with a ownership interest 
at december   the joint venture had aggregate outstanding indebtedness to third parties of  we have provided a guarantee on the joint venture s mortgage debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we loaned  to the joint venture to fund a portion of construction costs of the resort 
in  we expect to make a combined total of approximately  of equity contributions and additional loans to the joint venture to fund a portion of construction costs of the resort 
as capital may be required to fund the activities of the resorts owned by these joint ventures  we may in the future fund either or both of the joint ventures shares of the costs not funded by the majority owner of the joint venture  the joint ventures operations or outside financing 
based on the nature of the activities conducted in these joint ventures  management cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy amounts that we may be required to fund in the long term 
management does not currently believe that any additional future funding of these joint ventures will have an adverse effect on our financial condition  however  as currently we do not expect to make any significant future capital contributions to these joint ventures other than amounts described above 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment terms less than more than total year years years years debt obligations operating lease obligations construction contracts related party guarantee reserve on unrecognized tax benefits total includes  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of fixed rate debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by our sheboygan resort 
we have provided a partial guarantee on mortgage debt obtained by one of our joint ventures 
as we develop future resorts  we expect to incur significant additional debt and construction contract obligations 
working capital we had  of available cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of  current assets less current liabilities at december   compared to the  of available cash and cash equivalents and  of working capital at december  the primary reason for the decline in our working capital balance from december  to december  were the use of cash for capital expenditures and investments in and advances to related parties  for our properties under development  less proceeds from issuances of long term debt  and the classification of our mason mortgage loan maturing in december as a current liability as of december  
table of contents cash flows comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities investing activities 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from increased capital expenditures for our properties that are in service and our development properties 
this increase in net cash used was also due to distributions received in from our unconsolidated related party 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from less proceeds received from issuances of long term debt in as compared to offset by draws on our mason and grapevine construction loans during the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from a reduction in the net operating loss excluding our impairment loss for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was lower for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily because of the cash received due to the sale of interests in of our wisconsin dells and sandusky resorts 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from proceeds from our pocono mountains mortgage loan of  in inflation we are able to change room and amenity rates at our resort properties on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation can often be passed along to customers 
however  a weak economic environment that decreased overall demand for our products and services could restrict our ability to raise room and amenity rates to offset rising costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent  in part  upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings are also affected by the changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest income from cash and short term investments  and our interest expense from variable rate debt instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not intend to use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with two financial institutions on a notional amount of  the agreement expires in december the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on  of floating rate debt outstanding at a rate of per annum  thus reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the 
table of contents parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to us 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with major financial institutions  which are expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
in december  we entered into an interest rate cap that hedged our entire grapevine loan in accordance with our original loan document

this debt bears interest at a floating rate of day libor plus a spread of basis points 
the total rate was at december   of fixed rate debt effective interest rate of recognized as a liability related to certain bonds issued by the city of sheboygan and  of noninterest bearing debt recognized as a liability related to a loan from the city of sheboygan 
these liabilities will be satisfied by certain future minimum guaranteed amounts of real and personal property tax payments and room tax payments to be made by the sheboygan resort  and as of december   we estimate the total fair value of the indebtedness described above to be  less than their total carrying values  due to the terms of the existing debt being different than those terms we believe would currently be available to us for indebtedness with similar risks and remaining maturities 
if libor were to increase by or basis points  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately annually  based on our debt balances outstanding as of december  if libor were to decrease by or basis points  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would be approximately annually  based on our debt balances outstanding as of december
