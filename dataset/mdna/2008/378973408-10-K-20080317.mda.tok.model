item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of this report 
overview we are a provider of mobile voice and data communication services via satellite 
our communications platform extends telecommunications beyond the boundaries of terrestrial wireline and wireless telecommunications networks to serve our customer s desire for connectivity 
using in orbit satellites and ground stations  which we call gateways  we offer voice and data communications services to government agencies  businesses and other customers in over countries 
in early  old globalstar and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
we were formed in delaware in november for the purpose of acquiring substantially all the assets of old globalstar and its subsidiaries 
with bankruptcy court approval  we acquired old globalstar s assets and assumed certain of its liabilities in a two step transaction  with the first step completed on december   and the second step on april  the reorganization 
on january   we elected to be taxed as a c corporation  and on march   we converted from a delaware limited liability company to a delaware corporation 
material trends and uncertainties 
our satellite communications business  by providing critical mobile communications to our subscribers  serves principally the following markets government  public safety and disaster relief  recreation and personal  oil and gas  maritime and fishing  natural resources  mining and forestry  construction  utilities  and transportation 
our industry has been growing as a result of favorable market reaction to new pricing plans with lower service charges  awareness of the need for remote communication services  increased demand for communication services by disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders  improved voice and data transmission quality  and a general reduction in prices of user equipment 
in addition  our industry as a whole has benefited from the improved financial condition of most industry participants following their financial reorganizations 
nonetheless  as further described under risk factors  we face a number of challenges and uncertainties  including constellation life and health 
our current satellite constellation is aging 
we successfully launched our eight spare satellites in a number of our satellites launched prior to have experienced various anomalies over time  one of which is a degradation in the performance of the solid state power amplifiers of the s band communications antenna subsystem our two way communication issues 
the s band antenna provides the downlink from the satellite to a subscriber s phone or data terminal 
degraded performance of the s band antenna amplifiers reduces the availability of two way voice and data communication between the affected satellites and the subscriber and may reduce the duration of a call 
if the s band antenna on a satellite ceases to be commercially functional  two way communication is impossible over that satellite  but not necessarily over the constellation as a whole 
subscriber service will continue to be available  but at certain times in any given location it may take longer to establish calls and the average duration of calls may be impacted adversely 
there are periods of time each day during which no two way voice and data service is available at any particular location 
the root cause of our two way communication issues is unknown  although we believe it may result from irradiation of the satellites in orbit caused by the space environment at the altitude that our satellites operate 
the decline in the quality of two way communication does not affect adversely our one way simplex data transmission services  including our new spot products and services  which utilize only the l band uplink from a subscriber s simplex terminal to the satellites 
to date  we have managed the two way communication issue in various technical ways  including moving less impaired satellites to key orbital positions and launching eight spare satellites 
nonetheless  we have been unable to correct our two way communication issues 
although the rate of degradation of the s band anternnas has slowed in recent months  we continue to believe that  the quality of two way communication services will continue to decline  and by some time in substantially all of our satellites launched between and  but not those satellites launched in  will cease to be able to support two way communications 
simplex data services  including our new spot products and services  will not be affected 
we continue to work on plans  including new products and services and pricing programs to mitigate the effects of reduced service availability upon our customers and operations 
among other things  we requested thales alenia space to present a four part sequential plan for accelerating delivery of the initial satellites of our second generation constellation by up to four months 
in  we accepted the first two portions of this plan 
see part i  item a 
risk factors our satellites have a limited life and some have failed  which causes our network to be compromised and which materially and adversely affects our business  prospects and profitability 
competition and pricing pressures 
we face increased competition from both the expansion of terrestrial based cellular phone systems and from other mobile satellite service providers 
for example  inmarsat plans to commence offering satellite services to handheld devices in the united states around  and several competitors  such as ico global communications company  are constructing geostationary satellites that may provide mobile satellite service 
increased numbers of competitors  and the introduction of new services and products by competitors  increases competition for subscribers and pressures all providers  including us  to reduce prices 
increased competition may result in loss of subscribers  decreased revenue  decreased gross margins  higher churn rates  and  ultimately  decreased profitability and cash 
technological changes 
it is difficult for us to respond promptly to major technological innovations by our competitors because substantially modifying or replacing our basic technology  satellites or gateways is time consuming and very expensive 
approximately of our total assets at december  represented fixed assets 
although we plan to procure and deploy our second generation satellite constellation and upgrade our gateways and other ground facilities  we may nevertheless become vulnerable to the successful introduction of superior technology by our competitors 
capital expenditures 
we have incurred significant capital expenditures during and and we expect to incur additional significant expenditures through under the following commitments we estimate that procuring and deploying our second generation satellite constellation and upgrading our gateways and other ground facilities will cost approximately billion  which we expect will be reflected in capital expenditures through the following obligations are included in this amount on november   we entered into a contract with thales alenia space for the construction of our second generation constellation 
the total contract price  including subsequent additions  will be approximately million approximately million at a weighted average conversion rate of at december   including approximately million which will be paid by us in us dollars at a fixed conversion rate of 
we have made payments in the amount of approximately million approximately million through december  under this contract 
at our request  thales alenia space has presented to us a four part sequential plan for accelerating delivery of the initial satellites by up to four months 
the expected cost of this acceleration will range from approximately million to million million to million at 
in  we accepted the first two portions of this plan with an additional cost of million million at 
we cannot assure you that any of the remaining acceleration will occur 
in march  we entered into a million approximately million at a conversion rate of agreement with thales alenia space for the construction of the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment collectively  the control network facility for our second generation satellite constellation 
we have made payments in the amount of approximately million approximately million through december  on september   we entered into a contract with our launch provider for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services 
pursuant to the contract  our launch provider will make four launches of six satellites each  and we have the option to require our launch provider to make four additional launches of six satellites each 
the total contract price for the first four launches is million 
we have made payments in the amount of approximately million through december  we have begun construction of a gateway in singapore at a total cost of approximately million 
this gateway is expected to be fully operational in the second half of see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our requirements for funding these capital expenditures 
introduction of new products 
we work continuously with the manufacturers of the products we sell to offer our customers innovative and improved products 
virtually all engineering  research and development costs of these new products are paid by the manufacturers 
however  to the extent the costs are reflected in increased inventory costs to us  and we are unable to raise our prices to our subscribers correspondingly  our margins and profitability would be reduced 
fluctuations in interest and currency rates 
debt under our credit agreement bears interest at a floating rate 
therefore  increases in interest rates will increase our interest costs if debt is outstanding 
a substantial portion of our revenue for the year ended december  is denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  a substantial majority of our obligations under the contracts for our second generation constellation and related control network facility are denominated in euros 
any decline in the relative value of the us dollar may adversely affect our revenues and increase our capital expenditures 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 
simplex products personal tracking services and emergency messaging 
in early november  we introduced the spot satellite messenger  aimed at attracting both the recreational and commercial markets that require personal tracking  emergency location and messaging solutions for users that require these services beyond the range of traditional terrestrial and wireless communications 
using the globalstar simplex network and web based mapping software  this device provides consumers with the capability to trace or map the location of the user on google maps 
the product enables users to transmit messages to specific preprogrammed email addresses  phone or data devices  and to request assistance in the event of an emergency 
we are starting to work on second generation spot like applications 
spot addressable market we believe the addressable market for our spot products and services in north america alone is approximately million units 
our objective is to capture of that market by the end of the reach of our simplex system  on which our spot products and services relies  covers approximately of the world population 
we intend to market our spot products and services aggressively in our overseas markets including south and central america  western europe  and through independent gateway operators in their respective territories 
spot pricing the pricing for spot products and services and equipment is intended to be extremely competitive 
annual service fees currently range from for our basic level plan to for additional tracking capability 
we expect the equipment will be sold to end users at per unit 
spot distribution we are distributing and selling our new spot satellite messenger through a variety of existing and new distribution channels 
we have signed distribution agreements with a number of big box retailers and other similar distribution channels including bass pro shops  big sporting goods  big rock sports  boater s world  cabela s  campmor  joe s sport  outdoor and more  orvis  rei  rescue source  sportsman s warehouse  west marine and wynit 
our objective is to sell spot products through approximately  distribution points by the end of the second quarter of and  in currently  the spot satellite messenger is being sold in approximately  distribution points 
we also intend to sell directly using our existing salesforce into key vertical markets and through our direct e commerce website www 
findmespot 
com 
spot products and services have been introduced only recently and their commercial introduction and their commercial success cannot be assured 
ancillary terrestrial component atc 
atc is the integration of a satellite based service with a terrestrial wireless service resulting in a hybrid mobile satellite service 
the atc network would extend our services to urban areas and inside buildings in both urban and rural areas where satellite services currently are impractical 
we believe we are at the forefront of atc development and are actively working to be among the first market entrants 
to that end  we are considering a range of options for rollout of our atc services 
we are exploring selective opportunities with a variety of media and communication companies to capture the full potential of our spectrum and us atc license 
in addition to our agreement with open range communications  inc see item ancillary terrestrial component atc opportunities  we hope to exploit additional atc opportunities in urban markets or in suburban areas that are not the subject of our agreement with open range 
our system is flexible enough to allow us to use different technologies and network architectures in different geographic areas 
as described in item business atc opportunities  the fcc has opened a rulemaking proceeding to consider expanding the amount of spectrum in which we may provide atc from mhz to as much as mhz 
we and other interested parties have filed comments and reply comments  and we expect a decision in implementation of our agreement with open range communications is contingent upon our receiving substantially more atc spectrum in our s band than the mhz we currently have 
we believe that we have made a convincing case for mhz additional in the s band  however  we cannot predict whether the fcc will agree with us in its final decision 
service and subscriber equipment sales revenues 
the table below sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service and equipment sales for the years ended december   and year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue of total revenue revenue of total revenue revenue of total revenue service revenue mobile voice and data    fixed voice and data    satellite data modems data    asset tracking and monitoring   independent gateway operators    other    subtotal    subscriber equipment sales mobile equipment    fixed equipment    data equipment    accessories misc 
   subtotal    total revenue    includes activation fees and engineering service revenue 
operating income loss 
we realized an operating loss of million for the year ended december  compared to operating income of million in this decrease can be attributed primarily to a million charge for impairment of assets caused by a write down of our first generation product inventory recognized in we recognized these impairment charges after assessing our inventory and current and projected sales 
lower service revenue and a decline in equipment sales as a result of degradation of our two way communication service during the year ended december  compared to last year also contributed to the decline in operating results 
lower usage also resulted in lower retail average revenue per unit arpu on our monthly service plans 
moreover  concerns over the long term viability of  and service issues related to  our first generation constellation s voice service contributed to lower subscriber equipment sales for the year ended december  independent gateway acquisition strategy currently  of the gateways in our network are owned and operated by unaffiliated companies  which we call independent gateway operators  some of whom operate more than one gateway 
we have no financial interest in these independent gateway operators other than arms length contracts for wholesale minutes of service 
some of these independent gateway operators have been unable to grow their businesses adequately due in part to limited resources 
old globalstar initially developed the independent gateway operator acquisition strategy to establish operations in multiple territories with reduced demands on its capital 
in addition  there are territories in which for political or other reasons  it is impractical for us to operate directly 
we sell services to the independent gateway operators on a wholesale basis and they resell them to their customers on a retail basis 
we have acquired  and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of  independent gateway operators when we believe we can do so on favorable terms and the current independent operator has expressed a desire to sell its assets to us  subject to capital availability 
we believe that these acquisitions can enhance our results of operations in three respects 
first  we believe that  with our greater financial and technical resources  we can grow our subscriber base and revenue faster than some of the independent gateway operators 
second  we realize greater margin on retail sales to individual subscribers than we do on wholesale sales to independent gateway operators 
third  we believe expanding the territory we serve directly will better position us to market our services directly to multinational customers who require a global communications provider 
however  acquisitions of independent gateway operators do require us to commit capital for acquisition of their assets  as well as management resources and working capital to support the gateway operations  and therefore increase our risk in operating in these territories directly rather than through the independent gateway operators 
in addition  operating the acquired gateways increases our marketing  general and administrative expenses 
our credit agreement limits to million in cash the aggregate amount we may invest in foreign acquisitions without the consent of our lenders 
in february  we purchased the venezuela gateway for million in cash to be paid over four years 
effective january   we acquired the central american gateway and other real property assets for million  paid principally in shares of our common stock 
in december  we agreed to acquire an independent gateway operator that owns three satellite gateway ground stations in brazil for million 
the purchase price will be paid primarily in our common stock 
we are unable to predict the timing or cost of further acquisitions because independent gateway operations vary in size and value 
performance indicators our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our earnings and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include total revenue  which is an indicator of our overall business growth  subscriber growth and churn rate  which are both indicators of the satisfaction of our customers  arpu  which is an indicator of our pricing and ability to obtain effectively long term  high value customers  operating income  which is an indication of our performance  ebitda  which is an indicator of our financial performance  and capital expenditures  which are an indicator of future revenue growth potential and cash requirements 
seasonality our results of operations are subject to seasonal usage changes 
april through october are typically our peak months for service revenues and equipment sales 
government customers in north america tend to use our services during summer months  often in support of relief activities after events such as hurricanes  forest fires and other natural disasters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our revenues and expenses for the periods reported and the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  including contingent assets and liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  long lived assets  income taxes  pension obligations  derivative instruments and stock based compensation  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most important to understanding our financial results and condition and require complex or subjective judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition customer activation fees are deferred and recognized over four to five year periods  which approximates the estimated average life of the customer relationship 
we periodically evaluate the estimated customer relationship life 
historically  changes in the estimated life have not been material to our financial statements 
monthly access fees billed to retail customers and resellers  representing the minimum monthly charge for each line of service based on its associated rate plan  are billed on the first day of each monthly bill cycle 
airtime minute fees in excess of the monthly access fees are billed in arrears on the first day of each monthly billing cycle 
to the extent that billing cycles fall during the course of a given month and a portion of the monthly services has not been delivered at month end  fees are prorated and fees associated with the undelivered portion of a given month are deferred 
under certain annual plans  where customers prepay for minutes  revenue is deferred until the minutes are used or the prepaid time period expires 
unused minutes are accumulated until they expire  usually one year after activation 
in addition  we offer other annual plans under which the customer is charged an annual fee to access our system 
these fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the plan 
in some cases  we charge a per minute rate whereby we recognize the revenue when each minute is used 
occasionally we have granted to customers credits which are expensed or charged against deferred revenue when granted 
subscriber acquisition costs include items such as dealer commissions  internal sales commissions and equipment subsidies and are expensed at the time of the related sale 
we also provide certain engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies related to our system 
the revenues associated with these services are recorded when the services are rendered  and the expenses are recorded when incurred 
we own and operate our satellite constellation and earn a portion of our revenues through the sale of airtime minutes on a wholesale basis to independent gateway operators 
revenue from services provided to independent gateway operators is recognized based upon airtime minutes used by their customers and contractual fee arrangements 
if collection is uncertain  revenue is recognized when cash payment is received 
we introduced annual plans sometimes called liberty plans in august and broadened their availability during the second quarter of these plans grew substantially in and these plans require users to pre pay usage charges for the entire plan period  generally months  which results in the deferral of certain of our revenues 
under our revenue recognition policy for these annual plans  we defer revenue until the earlier of when the minutes are used or when these minutes expire 
any unused minutes are recognized as revenue at the expiration of a plan 
most of our customers have not used all the minutes that are available to them or have not used them at the pace anticipated  which has caused us to defer a portion of our service revenue 
during the second quarter of  we introduced an unlimited airtime usage service plan called the unlimited loyalty plan which allows existing and new customers to use unlimited satellite voice minutes for anytime calls for a fixed monthly or annual fee 
the unlimited loyalty plan incorporates a declining price schedule that reduces the fixed monthly fee at the completion of each calendar year through the duration of the customer agreement  which ends on june  customers have an option to extend their customer agreement by one year at the fixed price 
we record revenue for this plan on a monthly basis based on a straight line average derived by computing the total fees charged over the term of the customer agreement and dividing it by the number of the months 
if a customer cancels prior to the ending date of the customer agreement  the balance in deferred revenue is recognized as revenue 
at december  and december   our deferred revenue aggregated approximately million with million included in non current liabilities and million  respectively 
subscriber equipment revenue represents the sale of fixed and mobile user terminals and accessories 
revenue is recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliveries are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to account separately for some or all of the deliveries that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliveries are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
inventory inventory consists of purchased products  including fixed and mobile user terminals  accessories and gateway spare parts 
inventory acquired on december   through the old globalstar bankruptcy proceedings  was stated at fair value at the date of our acquisition 
subsequent inventory transactions are stated at the lower of cost or market 
at the end of each quarter  product sales and returns from the previous twelve months are reviewed and any excess and obsolete inventory is written off 
cost is computed using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory allowances for inventories with a lower market value or that are slow moving are recorded in the period of determination 
globalstar system  property and equipment our globalstar system assets include costs for the design  manufacture  test and launch of a constellation of low earth orbit satellites  including satellites previously held as ground spares which we launched in may and october  which we refer to as the space segment  and primary and backup terrestrial control centers and gateways  which we refer to as the ground segment 
loss from an in orbit failure of a satellite is recognized as an expense in the period it is determined that the satellite is not recoverable 
the carrying value of the globalstar system is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value of the space segment and ground segment may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
the satellites previously recorded as spare satellites and subsequently incorporated into the globalstar system on the date the satellite is placed into service the in service date will be depreciated over an estimated life of eight years beginning on the satellite s in service date 
property and equipment acquired by us on december  in the old globalstar bankruptcy proceedings was recorded based on our allocation of acquisition cost 
because the acquisition cost of these assets was substantially below their historic cost or replacement cost  current depreciation and amortization costs have been reduced substantially for gaap purposes  thereby increasing net income or decreasing net loss 
as we increase our capital expenditures  especially to procure and launch our second generation satellite constellation  we expect gaap depreciation to increase substantially 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 
income taxes until january   we were treated as a partnership for us tax purposes 
generally  our taxable income or loss  deductions and credits were passed through to our members 
we did have some corporate subsidiaries that required a tax provision or benefit using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

effective january   we elected to be taxed as a c corporation in the united states 
when an enterprise changes its tax status from non taxable to taxable  under sfas no 
the effect of recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities is included in income from continuing operations in the period of change 
as a result  we recognized a gross deferred tax asset of million and a gross deferred tax liability of million on january  sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not recognize the entire deferred tax asset  therefore  we established a valuation allowance of million  resulting in recognition of a net deferred tax benefit of million 
we monitor the situation to ensure that  if and when we are more likely than not to be able to utilize more of the deferred tax asset  we will be able to reduce the valuation allowance accordingly 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the impact of this adoption on our financial statements 
spare satellites  launch costs and second generation satellites old globalstar purchased eight additional satellites in for million including performance incentives of up to million to serve as on ground spares 
costs of million including a portion of the performance incentives were previously recognized for these spare satellites 
prior to december   old globalstar recorded an impairment of these assets  and at december  they were carried at million 
the eight spare satellites were launched successfully in two separate launches of four satellites each in may and october depreciation of these assets commences when the satellites are placed in service and begin to handle call traffic 
as of december   five of the eight satellites had been placed into service and were handling call traffic 
the remaining three satellites are being placed into their desired orbital plane 
as of december  and december   these assets were recorded at million and million  respectively 
the amount relating to spare satellites that were placed into service during the year ended december  approximately million  was classified within the globalstar system as part of the space segment 
these satellites will be a part of the second generation constellation and are being depreciated over an estimated useful life of eight years 
on november   we entered into a contract with thales alenia space to construct low earth orbit satellites 
the total contract price  including subsequent additions  is approximately million approximately million at a weighted average conversion rate of at december  including approximately million which will be paid by us in us dollars at a fixed conversion rate of 
the contract requires thales alenia space to commence delivery of satellites in the third quarter of  with deliveries continuing until unless we elect to accelerate delivery 
if we elect to accelerate delivery of the second phase of satellites  it is contemplated that all of the satellites will be delivered by the third quarter of as of december  and  capitalized interest recorded was million and million  respectively 
at our request  thales alenia space has presented a four part sequential plan to us for accelerating delivery of the initial satellites by up to four months 
the expected cost of this acceleration will range from approximately million to million million to million at 
in  we accepted the first two portions of this plan with an additional cost of million million at 
we cannot assure you that any of the remaining acceleration will occur 
in march   we entered into an agreement with thales alenia space for the construction of the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment collectively  the control network facility for the company s second generation satellite constellation 
this agreement complements the second generation satellite construction contract with thales alenia space for the construction of low earth orbit satellites and allows thales alenia space to coordinate all aspects of the second generation satellite constellation project  including the transition of first generation software and hardware to equipment for the second generation 
the total contract price for the construction and associated services is million approximately million at a conversion rate of consisting of million for the satellite operations control centers  million for the telemetry command units and million for the in orbit test equipment  with payments to be made on a quarterly basis through completion of the control network facility in late on september   we entered into a contract with our launch provider for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services 
pursuant to the contract  our launch provider will make four launches of six satellites each  and we have the option to require our launch provider to make four additional launches of six satellites each 
the total contract price for the first four launches is million 
the total cost for the launches under this contract is included in our estimate of approximately billion to procure and deploy our second generation satellite constellation and related gateway upgrades 
the depreciation on these assets will begin once the assets are completed and placed into service 
pension obligations we have a company sponsored retirement plan covering certain current and past us based employees 
until june   substantially all of old globalstar s and our employees and retirees who participated and or met the vesting criteria for the plan were participants in the retirement plan of space systems loral  inc the loral plan  a defined benefit pension plan 
the accrual of benefits in the old globalstar segment of the loral plan was curtailed  or frozen  by the administrator of the loral plan as of october  prior to october   benefits for the loral plan were generally based upon compensation  length of service with the company and age of the participant 
on june   the assets and frozen pension obligations of the segment attributable to our employees were transferred into a new globalstar retirement plan the globalstar plan 
the globalstar plan remains frozen and participants are not currently accruing benefits beyond those accrued as of october  our funding policy is to fund the globalstar plan in accordance with the internal revenue code and regulations 
we account for our defined benefit pension and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas  sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
on december  and this adoption did not have any impact on our results of operation 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
we utilize the services of a third party to perform these actuarial calculations 
we determine the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for the us pension plan 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
using these methodologies  we determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of december   which is an increase of percentage points from the rate used as of december  an increase of in the discount rate would have decreased our plan liabilities as of december  by million and a decrease of could have increased our plan liabilities by million 
a significant element in determining our pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  our assumption for the expected return on plan assets was for the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and  under certain circumstances  amortized over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net unrecognized pension actuarial losses of million 
these amounts represent potential future pension and postretirement expenses that would be amortized over average future service periods 
derivative instrument we utilize a derivative instrument in the form of an interest rate swap agreement and a forward contract for purchasing foreign currency to minimize our risk from interest rate fluctuations related to our variable rate credit agreement and minimize our risk from fluctuations related to the foreign currency exchange rates  respectively 
we use the interest rate swap agreement and the forward contract for purchasing foreign currency to manage risk and not for trading or other speculative purposes 
at the end of each accounting period  we record the derivative instrument on our balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value 
the interest rate swap agreement and the forward contract for purchasing foreign currency do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the forward contract for purchasing foreign currency are recognized as interest rate derivative gain loss and other income over the life of the agreements  respectively 
we have agreed to provide collateral in the form of cash and securities equal to any negative value of the interest rate swap agreement 
stock based compensation effective january   as a result of our initial public offering  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas r  and related interpretations  or sfas r  to account for stock based compensation using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated our prior period results 
among other things  sfas r requires that compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for both employee and non employee share based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
at january   the option of one board member to purchase up to  shares of common stock at per share was the only outstanding equity award 
compensation cost related to the remaining portion of this award for which the requisite service had not been rendered was insignificant 
therefore  the adoption of sfas r did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
additionally  stock based compensation expense includes an estimate for pre vesting forfeitures and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards on a straight line basis  which is generally commensurate with the vesting term 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for a stock option grant was recognized only if the exercise price was less than the market value of our common stock on the grant date 
results of operations comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and statements of operations year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands revenue service revenue   subscriber equipment sales   total revenue   operating expenses cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below   cost of subscriber equipment sales   marketing  general and administrative   depreciation and amortization   impairment of assets   total operating expenses   operating income loss   n a interest income   interest expense   interest rate derivative loss   other income expense  net   n a income loss before income taxes   n a income tax expense benefit   n a net income loss   n a includes related party amounts of and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
includes related party amounts of and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue 
total revenue decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   from million for this decrease is attributable in part to lower service revenues as a result of our two way communication issues

our cost of services for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
our cost of services is comprised primarily of network operating costs  which are generally fixed in nature 
these costs declined as a result of lower telecom costs and reductions in certain labor costs offset partially by an increase in non cash executive incentive compensation as compared to cost of subscriber equipment sales

total revenue increased million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this increase was due principally to the growth in service revenue related to the additional approximately  net subscribers we added during the year ended december  our average monthly retail revenue per user during the year ended december  decreased by to from during the year ended december  this decline resulted from the rapid acceptance of our annual plans  which were first introduced broadly in the second quarter of and which allow subscribers to pay for a year of service in advance 
these pricing plans were extensively purchased 
annual plans reduce current period revenue because revenue is not recognized until minutes are used or expire 
unused minutes are recognized as revenue at the expiration of a plan 
subscribers generally do not use all of the minutes for which they have paid 
average monthly subscriber churn decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  service revenue

at january   our principal short term liquidity needs were to make payments to procure our second generation satellite constellation  construct the control network facility and launch related costs  in a total amount not yet determined  but which will include approximately million payable to thales alenia space by december under the purchase contract for our second generation satellites and million payable to thales alenia space by december under the contract for construction of the control network facility  respectively  to fund our working capital million at december   which our management believes is sufficient for our present requirements  and to fulfill cash escrow requirements under the thales alenia space contract for procurement of our second generation satellites approximating an additional million approximately million at through december  during the years ended december  and  our principal sources of liquidity were dollars in millions year ended december  year ended december  cash on hand at beginning of period capital contributions by thermo net borrowings under thermo funding credit agreement purchase of common stock by thermo funding proceeds of initial public offering  net cash generated used by operations we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements from the following sources borrowings under our credit agreement with thermo funding of which the entire million related to the revolving credit facility was drawn at december  and the entire million related to the delayed draw term loan was undrawn at december  we have subsequently drawn million of the delayed draw term loan during  and cash on hand million at december  
our principal long term liquidity needs are to pay the costs of procuring and deploying our second generation satellite constellation and upgrading our gateways and other ground facilities  to fund our working capital  including any growth in working capital required by growth in our business  and to fund the cash requirements of our independent gateway operator acquisition strategy  in an amount not determinable at this time 
we expect to fund our long term capital needs with any remaining funds available under our credit agreement  cash flow  which we expect will be generated primarily from sales of our simplex products and services  including our new spot products and services  and the incurrence of additional indebtedness  additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of funds 
we will require significant additional capital and currently have not obtained any commitment for such funds 
see capital expenditures below and part i  item a 
risk factors we must generate significant cash flow from operations and have to raise additional capital in order to complete our second generation satellite constellation 
our liquidity and our ability to fund these needs will depend to a significant extent on our future financial performance  which will be subject in part to general economic  financial  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control  including our ability to achieve positive cash flow from operations despite the problems with our satellite constellation described elsewhere  the willingness of others to invest in the company and trends in our industry and technology discussed elsewhere in this report 
in addition to these general and economic and industry factors  the principal factors affecting our cash flows will be our ability to continue to provide attractive and competitive services and products  successfully manage the degradation of our current satellite constellation until we can deploy our second generation satellite constellation  increase our number of subscribers and retail average revenue per unit  control our costs  and maintain our margins and profitability 
if those factors change significantly or other unexpected factors adversely affect us  our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future financings may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all to meet our liquidity needs 
in assessing our liquidity  our management reviews and analyzes our current cash on hand  the average number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding  the contractual rates that we have established with our vendors  inventory turns  foreign exchange rates  capital expenditure commitments and income tax rates 
net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased to a cash outflow of million from a cash inflow of million for this decrease was due primarily to lower revenues and lower inventory turnover during the year ended december  as compared to net cash from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily the result of capital expenditures associated with construction expenses for our second generation satellite constellation and the launches of our eight spare satellites in net cash from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million from million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily the result of million of equity purchased by thermo funding pursuant to its irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement and million drawn on the revolving credit agreement with thermo funding offset by million received as proceeds from our initial public offering in november  and million received pursuant to thermo funding s irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement during capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of upgrading our satellite constellation and gateways and other ground facilities

in march  we entered into an agreement with thales alenia space for the construction of the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment collectively  the control network facility for our second generation satellite constellation 
this agreement complements the second generation satellite construction contract with thales alenia space for the construction of low earth orbit satellites and allows thales alenia space to coordinate all aspects of the second generation satellite constellation project  including the transition of first generation software and hardware to equipment for the second generation 
the total contract price for the construction and associated services is million approximately million at a conversion rate of consisting of million for the satellite operations control centers  million for the telemetry command units and million for the in orbit test equipment  with payments to be made on a quarterly basis through completion of the control network facility in late we have made payments in the amount of approximately million approximately million through december  in september  we entered into a contract with our launch provider for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services

the total contract price for the first four launches is million 
as of december   we have incurred million associated with the our launch services contract 
the total cost for the satellites and launches under these contracts with thales alenia space and our launch provider are included in the estimated billion the majority of which is denominated in euros of capital expenditures which we currently anticipate will be required to procure and deploy our second generation satellite constellation and related gateway upgrades 
since the fourth quarter of  we have used portions of the proceeds from sales of common stock to thermo funding under the irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement  the proceeds from our initial public offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the approximately million excluding internal costs and capitalized interest but including million which is held in escrow pursuant to the contract for the procurement of our second generation satellite constellation to secure our payment obligations under that contract paid through december  we expect to fund the balance of the capital expenditures through cash generated by our duplex voice and data services  new spot satellite messenger products and services and other simplex devices and services  borrowings under our credit agreement with thermo funding  future debt financings  additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources
