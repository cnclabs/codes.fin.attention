assessing the impairment of goodwill requires that the company make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of its net assets 
the company completed its most recent annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill as of december  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
this evaluation was primarily based on the market and income approaches 
these approaches utilize information such as values of similar publicly traded companies  recent acquisitions of companies  arms length transactions in the company s stock  and forecasted revenues and cash flows of the company

these include estimates of the expected term of share based awards  expected volatility of the company s stock price  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate 
these estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and may result in materially different amounts should circumstances change and the company employs different assumptions in its application of sfas r in future periods

in certain select cases  the company has issued warrants  outside the ltip  to service providers in exchange for the performance of consulting or other services 
these warrants have generally been immediately vesting and expense was recognized equal to the fair value of the warrant on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the same assumptions and related risks as discussed above apply  with the exception of the expected term 
for these warrants issued to service providers  the company estimates that the warrant will be held for the full term 
for the year ended december   the company recognized  of compensation expense for warrants issued to service providers
