item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and overview as of december  we managed our portfolio within seven geographic segments pennsylvania  new jersey delaware  richmond  virginia  california north  california south  metropolitan washington  dc and southwest 
the pennsylvania segment includes properties in chester  delaware  berks  bucks  cumberland  dauphin  lehigh and montgomery counties in the philadelphia suburbs and the city fo philadelphia in pennsylvania 
the new jersey delaware segment includes properties in counties in the southern and central part of new jersey including burlington  camden and mercer counties and the state of delaware 
the richmond  virginia segment includes properties primarily in albemarle  chesterfield and henrico counties  the city of richmond and durham  north carolina 
the california north segment includes properties in the city of oakland and concord 
the california south segment includes properties in the city of carlsbad and rancho bernardo 
the metropolitan washington  dc segment includes properties in northern virginia and suburban maryland 
the southwest segment includes properties in travis county of texas 
we receive income primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from our properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
our financial performance is dependent upon the demand for office  industrial and other commercial space in our markets and prevailing interest rates 
as we seek to increase revenue through our operating activities  our management also seeks to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk we are subject to the risk that tenant leases  upon expiration  are not renewed  that space may not be relet  or that the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty in we maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals 
our retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in was 
if we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases  at anticipated rental rates  or if tenants terminate their leases early  our cash flow would be adversely impacted 
tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our management regularly evaluates our accounts receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
our accounts receivable allowance was million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  development risk as of december   we had in development or redevelopment sites aggregating approximately million square feet 
we estimate the total cost of these projects to be million and we had incurred million of these costs as of december  we are actively marketing space at these projects to prospective tenants but can provide no assurance as to the timing or terms of any leases of space 
table of contents at these projects 
as of december   we owned approximately acres of undeveloped land 
risks associated with development of this land include construction cost increases or overruns and construction delays  insufficient occupancy rates  building moratoriums and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
we record acquisition of real estate investments under the purchase method of accounting and allocate the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
we expense routine repair and maintenance expenditures and capitalize those items that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets 
real estate ventures when we obtain an economic interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity vie  and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
if the entity is not deemed to be a vie  and we serve as the general partner within the entity  we evaluate to determine if our presumed control as the general partner is overcome by the kick out rights and other substantive participating rights of the limited partners in accordance with eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
we consolidate i entities that are vies and of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we control 
entities that we account for under the equity method ie  at cost  increased or decreased by our share of earnings or losses  less distributions include i entities that are vies and of which we are not deemed the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we do not control  but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
we will reconsider our determination of whether an entity is a vie and who the primary beneficiary is if events occur that are likely to cause a change in the original determinations 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets our management reviews investments in real estate and real estate ventures for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset  determined using customary valuation techniques  such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as real estate investments and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities relating to assets classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
income taxes the company has elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in addition  the company has several subsidiary reits 
in order to maintain their qualification as a reit  the company and each of its reit subsidiaries are required to  among other things  distribute at least of their reit taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets 
as reits  the company and its reit subsidiaries are not subject to federal income tax with respect to the portion of its income that meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the operations of these reits 
the company and its reit subsidiaries intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows them to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as reits 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company or one of its reit subsidiaries were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
the company is subject to certain state and local taxes 
provision for such taxes has been included in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company may elect to treat one or more of its subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
in general  a trs of the company may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
the company has elected to treat certain of its corporate subsidiaries as trss  these entities provide third party property management services and certain services to tenants that could not otherwise be provided 
at december   our trss had tax net operating loss nol carryforward of approximately million  expiring from to we have ascribed a full valuation allowance to our net deferred tax assets 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized no material adjustments regarding our tax accounting treatment 
we expect to recognize interest and penalties  to the extent incurred related to uncertain tax positions  if any  as income tax expense  which would be included in general and administrative expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts 
table of contents where we have determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  we use our judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
these reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred costs we incur direct costs related to the financing  development and leasing of our properties 
management exercises judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants and economic and market conditions change 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on fair values 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases  including any fixed rate renewal periods 
other intangible assets also include amounts representing the value of tenant relationships and in place leases based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
we estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  include leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
this intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
we estimate fair value through methods similar to those used by independent appraisers or by using independent appraisals 
factors that we consider in our analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from three to twelve months 
characteristics that we consider in allocating value to our tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our business relationship with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals  but in no event longer than the remaining depreciable life of the building 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining non cancellable term of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of each intangible  including market rate adjustments  in place lease values and tenant relationship values  would be charged to expense 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same store properties and the total portfolio 
the same store properties consists of properties containing an aggregate of approximately million net rentable square feet that we owned for the entire twelve month periods ended december  and substantially all of the period ended december  we consider the properties that we acquired in the prentiss merger on january  as part of our same store portfolio and  therefore  the results of operations for the year ended december  do not include four days of activity 
this table also includes a reconciliation from the same store properties to the total portfolio ie  all properties owned by us as of december  and by providing information for the properties which were acquired  under development  redevelopment or placed into service and administrative elimination information for the years ended december  and the total portfolio net income presented in the table agrees to the net income of brandywine realty trust 
the only difference between the reported net income of brandywine realty trust and brandywine operating partnership is the allocation of the minority interest attributable to continuing and discontinued operations for limited partnership units of the operating partnership that is reflected in the statement of operations for brandywine realty trust

table of contents total revenue cash rents from the total portfolio increased by million from to  primarily reflecting an additional million at the same store portfolio from increased occupancy and increased rents received on lease renewals 
an additional million from six properties that we acquired during and six development redevelopment properties including additional occupancy at cira centre that we completed and placed in service in and two that were placed in service in december these increases were offset by the decrease of million in cash rents at our development redevelopment properties primarily as a result of six buildings  which are now included in redevelopment  that were occupied during our rents at the total portfolio that we recognized from the net amortization of above and below market leases at acquired properties  in conformity with sfas no 
 increased by million primarily as a result of million of above market leases in our same store portfolio being fully amortized and the acquisition of eight properties during two of these properties are included in the development redevelopment properties 
tenant reimbursements at the total portfolio increased by million primarily as a result of increased operating expenses of million 
operating expenses and real estate taxes property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  at the total portfolio increased by million from to  primarily reflecting an increase of million at the same store portfolio  primarily due to increased occupancy and real estate tax reassessments 
increased occupancy at our properties causes an increase in the amount of expense incurred for utilities  security  and janitorial services 
the incurrence of million of property operating expenses for six of the properties acquired during and eight development redevelopment properties that we completed and placed in service during or after december depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased by million in compared to  primarily reflecting the incurrence of million of depreciation and amortization expense on account of six properties that we acquired during and eight development redevelopment properties including additional occupancy at cira centre that we completed and placed in service during or after december this increase was offset by million of accelerated depreciation expense for one of our properties e 
swedesford road which was demolished as part of an office park development in suburban philadelphia during this property is included in development redevelopment properties 
the increase is also offset by a decrease of million in our same store portfolio 
this decrease is the result of assets within our same store portfolio being fully amortized subsequent to administrative expenses our administrative expenses decreased by approximately million in compared to  primarily reflecting higher costs that we incurred in as part of our integration activities following our january merger with prentiss partially offset by the severance costs incurred in the third quarter of interest income expense 
table of contents we used our investment in marketable securities to pay down defeased debt in the fourth quarter of this pay down caused a decrease million in interest income 
this decrease was partially offset by the amount of interest income earned on funds held in escrow with a qualified intermediary as part of completed like kind transactions 
interest expense decreased by million primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest of million during compared to the increased amount of capitalized interest is the result of a greater number of development and redevelopment projects and increased project funding for those projects that are under development in both periods 
at december   we had seven projects under development and seven projects under redevelopment with total project costs on which we are presently capitalizing interest of million 
as of december   we had six projects under development and three projects under redevelopment with total project costs on which we were capitalizing interest through that date of million 
this decrease was offset by increased interest expense on our unsecured debt based on the timing of the issuances of unsecured debt during and as noted in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
loss on settlement of treasury lock agreements in july  in anticipation of an expected debt offering  we entered into four treasury lock agreements 
the treasury lock agreements were designated as cash flow hedges on interest rate risk and qualified for hedge accounting 
the agreements were settled on september   the original termination date of each agreement  at a total cost of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the planned debt issuance was not probable and recorded million as an expense for the residual balance of million 
equity in income of real estate ventures the increase of million over is primarily due to a distribution of million received as a result of our residual profit interest in a real estate venture and the completion of an office property that was placed in service by a real estate venture during net gain on disposition of depreciated real estate as more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we recognized a gain on the partial transfer of interests in properties to which we retained a significant continuing involvement with the properties through our joint venture interest and our management and leasing services 
as a result of this continuing involvement  we have determined that the gain on disposition and the operations of the properties should not be included in discontinued operations 
net gain on disposition of undepreciated real estate this line represents the gain recorded in each year for undeveloped land parcels that were sold 
the parcels are not included in discontinued operations since they were not developed prior to sale 
we sold seven land parcels in and three in gain on termination of purchase contract we held a fifty percent economic interest in an approximately  square foot office building located at paragon drive  montvale  new jersey 
the remaining fifty percent interest was held by donald e 
axinn  one of the company s trustees 
although we and mr 
axinn had each committed to provide one half of the million necessary to repay the mortgage loan secured by this property at the maturity of the loan  in february an unaffiliated third party entered into an agreement to purchase this property for million 
as a result of the purchase by an unaffiliated third party during august  we recognized a million gain on termination of our under a contribution agreement  modified in  that entitled us to the fifty percent interest in the joint venture to operate the property 

table of contents minority interest partners share of consolidated real estate ventures minority interest partners share of consolidated real estate ventures represents the portion of income from our consolidated real estate ventures that is allocated to our minority interest partners 
as of december  we held an ownership interest in three properties through consolidated real estate ventures  compared to properties owned by consolidated real estate ventures at december  on march   we acquired the minority interest in one of our consolidated real estate ventures that owned office properties containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet for a purchase price of million 
minority interest attributable to continuing operations lp units minority interest attributable to continuing operations lp units  represents the equity in loss income attributable to the portion of the operating partnership not owned by us 
minority interests owned and of the operating partnership as of december  and  respectively 
discontinued operations during  we sold one property in east norriton  pa  five properties in dallas  tx  properties in reading and harrisburg  pa  one in voorhees  nj  one property in west norriton  pa and one property in newark  de 
these properties had total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  gains on sale of million and minority interest attributable to discontinued operations of million 
the december  amount is reclassified to include the operations of the properties sold during  as well as the properties that were sold during the year ended december  therefore  the discontinued operations amount for the year ended includes properties with total revenue of million  operating expenses of million  interest expense of million and minority interest of million 
the eight properties that were sold in the first quarter of did not have gains on sale since such properties were acquired as part of the prentiss merger and the value ascribed to those properties in purchase accounting was approximately the fair value amount for which the properties were sold 
net income net income increased by million from primarily as a result of an increase of million in operating income and the gain on disposition of depreciated real estate of million noted above 
these increases are offset by the gain on sale of undepreciated real estate of million and gain on termination of our purchase contract of million earned in net income is significantly impacted by depreciation of operating properties and amortization of acquired intangibles 
these charges do not affect our ability to pay dividends and may not be comparable to those of other real estate companies 
such charges can be expected to continue until the values ascribed to the lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated duration of the tenant relationship 
earnings per common share earnings per share diluted and basic were for as compared to diluted and basic of for as a result of the factors described above and a decrease in the average number of common shares outstanding 
the decrease in the average number of common shares outstanding is the result of million shares repurchased in and million shares that we repurchased in this decrease in the number of shares was partially offset by the issuance of shares upon option exercises and restricted share vesting 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same store properties and the total portfolio

table of contents total revenue revenue increased by million primarily due to the acquired properties primarily prentiss  which represents million of this increase 
the increase is also the result of properties placed in service  including cira centre  which contributed million to this increase 
the increase in total revenue from our same store properties of million is primarily attributable to increased occupancy as well as increased tenant reimbursements resulting from higher property operating expenses 
operating expenses and real estate taxes property operating expenses increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss and other properties  which represents million of this increase 
property operating expenses attributable to the increased occupancy of cira centre and other completed developments resulted in an additional million of property operating expense 
real estate taxes increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss and other properties  which represents million of this increase 
the remainder of the increase primarily is the result of increased real estate tax assessments in our same store portfolio and properties placed in service 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss and other properties  which increased total portfolio depreciation expense by million 
a significant portion of the increase  million  is also due to accelerated depreciation expense associated with the demolition of one of our properties as part of an office park development in suburban philadelphia 
this property was part of our same store portfolio  therefore the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization for our same store portfolio is million 
this increase resulted from the timing of assets being placed in service upon completion of tenant improvement and capital improvement projects subsequent to the end of the nine month period ending september  the depreciation and amortization for our development properties increased by million as a result of timing of the properties being completed and placed into service 
administrative expenses administrative expenses increased by approximately million primarily due to the acquisition of prentiss 
of this increase  million was primarily attributable to increased payroll and related costs associated with employees that we hired as part of the acquisition of prentiss 
we also incurred an additional million in professional fees in connection with our merger integration activities 
the remainder of the increase reflects other increased costs of the combined companies which includes an increase in deferred compensation expense of million 
interest income expense interest expense and deferred financing costs increased by approximately million primarily as a result of fixed rate mortgages  three unsecured notes  and one note secured by us treasury notes pprefi debt that we assumed or entered into to finance the prentiss merger 
the mortgages assumed have maturity dates ranging from through and the unsecured notes have maturities ranging from through the pprefi debt had a maturity of february  but we elected to prepay this debt in november the pprefi debt was defeased by prentiss in the fourth quarter of and was secured by an investment in us treasury notes 
the interest earned on the treasury notes is included in interest income and 
table of contents substantially offsets the amount of interest expense incurred on the pprefi debt  resulting in an immaterial amount of net interest expense incurred 
the increase of million in interest income is primarily attributable to the interest income earned on these treasury notes 
see the notes to consolidated financial in part iv  item for details of our mortgage indebtedness and unsecured notes outstanding 
gain on termination of purchase contract we held a fifty percent economic interest in an approximately  square foot office building located at paragon drive  montvale  new jersey 
the remaining fifty percent interest was held by donald e 
axinn  one of the company s trustees 
although we and mr 
axinn had each committed to provide one half of the million necessary to repay the mortgage loan secured by this property at the maturity of the loan  in february an unaffiliated third party entered into an agreement to purchase this property for million 
as a result of the purchase by an unaffiliated third party during august  we recognized a million gain on termination of our rights under a contribution agreement  modified in  that entitled us to the fifty percent interest in the joint venture to operate the property 
minority interest partners share of consolidated real estate ventures minority interest partners share of consolidated real estate ventures represents the portion of income from our consolidated joint ventures that is allocated to our minority interest partners 
as of december  we held an ownership interest in properties through consolidated real estate ventures  compared to two properties owned by consolidated real estate ventures at december  minority interest attributable to continuing operations lp units minority interest attributable to continuing operations lp units represents the equity in loss income attributable to the portion of the operating partnership not owned by us 
the increase from the prior year is primarily the result of the fact that at december  the lp units share in our net loss from continuing operations compared to their share of net income from continuing operations in the prior year 
minority interests owned and of the operating partnership as of december  and  respectively 
the change in minority interest ownership is primarily the result of the class a units that we issued in the prentiss acquisition 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations increased by million from the prior year as a result of the sale of eight properties in chicago  il  five in dallas  tx  and one in allen  tx that we acquired in the prentiss acquisition 
we also sold five properties that were previously included in our same store portfolio 
these properties combined had net income of million and gain on sale of million during the year ended december  before minority interest 
included in the gain on sale amount was million attributable to minority interest in the chicago property that was sold by one of our consolidated real estate ventures 
net income net income declined by million in the year ended december   compared to the same period in as increased revenues in were offset by increases in operating expenses primarily depreciation and amortization and financing costs 
all major financial statement captions increased as a result of our acquisition of prentiss and the related financing required to complete the transaction 
a significant element of these increases relate to additional depreciation and amortization charges from the significant property additions including both the trc acquisition in and the prentiss acquisition and the values ascribed to related acquired intangibles eg  in place leases 
these charges do not affect our 
table of contents ability to pay dividends and may not be comparable to those of other real estate companies that have not made such acquisitions 
such charges can be expected to continue until the values ascribed to the lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated tenant relationship 
in addition  a significant portion of the decrease in net income is attributable to the million in depreciation expense described in the depreciation and amortization expense section above 
earnings per common share earnings per common share of for the year ended december  as compared to earnings per common share of in declined as a result of the factors described in net income above and an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding 
we issued million common shares in our acquisition of prentiss 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are as follows fund normal recurring expenses  fund capital expenditures  including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund development and redevelopment costs  fund new property acquisitions  and fund distributions declared by our board of trustees  including the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by our operating and financing activities 
rental revenue  expense recoveries from tenants  and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash that we use to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our revenue also includes third party fees generated by our property management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from equity and debt financings  will continue to provide funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations would affect the financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for costs of developments  redevelopments  property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions  leasing commissions  tenant improvements and capital improvements 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
we use our credit facility for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
in october  we entered into a million unsecured term loan  in april and march  we sold million and million  respectively of unsecured notes and in september and october  we sold an aggregate of million of exchangeable unsecured notes 
as of december  we also had approximately million of mortgage loans 
we expect to continue to use the debt and equity markets for our long term capital needs 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
we currently have investment grade ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from 
table of contents three major rating agencies 
if a rating agency were to downgrade our credit rating  our access to capital in the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our existing credit facility and term loan would increase 
our ability to sell common and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our shares 
we regularly analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 
the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that we consider attractive 
the asset sales during and have also been a significant source of cash 
during  we sold properties containing an aggregate of million net rentable square feet and eight land parcels containing an aggregate acres for aggregate proceeds of million 
we have several options for the use of proceeds from asset sales  including the acquisition of assets in our core markets  repayment of debt and repurchase of our shares

as of december  and  we maintained cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
this million decrease was the result of the following changes in cash flow from our various activities activity operating investing financing net cash flows our principal source of cash flows is from the operation of our properties 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily the result of the timing of the cash receipts from our tenants and cash expenditures in the normal course of operations of our properties

we intend to refinance or repay our mortgage loans as they mature  primarily through the use of unsecured debt or equity 
our charter documents do not limit the amount or form of indebtedness that we may incur  and our policies on debt incurrence are solely within the discretion of our board  subject to financial covenants in the credit facility  indenture and other credit agreements

subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws  and if warranted by market conditions  we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the registration statement 
short and long term liquidity we believe that our cash flow from operations is adequate to fund our short term liquidity requirements 
cash flow from operations is generated primarily from rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements from tenants and management services income from providing services to third parties 
we intend to use these funds to meet short term liquidity needs  which are to fund operating expenses  debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  tenant allowances  leasing commissions and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as for property acquisitions  development  investments in real estate ventures  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other significant capital improvements  through cash from operations  borrowings under the credit facility  additional unsecured and secured indebtedness  the issuance of equity securities  contributions from joint venture investors and proceeds from asset dispositions 
inflation a majority of our leases provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of our office leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be partially offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases

interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   our consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages  million borrowings under our credit facility  million of swing line borrowings  million borrowings in an unsecured term loan and billion in unsecured notes net of discounts of which billion are fixed rate borrowings and million are variable rate borrowings 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position
