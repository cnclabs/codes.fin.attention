item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements which accompany this report 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  we  us and our refers to proassurance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on current and historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve the largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses 
net losses in any period reflect our estimate of net losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for net losses of prior periods 
the estimation of medical professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
ultimate loss costs  even for claims with similar characteristics  vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to  the nature of the injury and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant s family  the outcome of jury trials  the legislative and judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and the trend of health care costs 
medical professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
in establishing our reserve for losses management considers a variety of factors including historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation on medical care  general economic trends and the legal environment 
we perform an in depth review of our reserve for losses on a semi annual basis 
additionally  during each reporting period we update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses and make adjustments that we believe best reflect emerging data 
any adjustments are reflected in the then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 

table of contents external actuaries review our reserve for losses at least semi annually 
we consider the views of the external actuaries as well as other factors  such as known  anticipated or estimated changes in frequency and severity of claims  loss retention levels and premium rates in establishing our reserves 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered by management there is a significant risk that actual incurred losses will develop differently from these estimates 
in establishing our initial reserves for a given accident year we rely significantly on the loss assumptions embedded within our pricing 
because of the historically volatile nature of medical liability losses  we establish the initial loss estimates at a level which is approximately above the pricing assumptions 
this difference recognizes the volatility of the medical malpractice loss environment and the risk in determining pricing parameters 
as each accident year matures we analyze reserves in a variety of ways 
we use a variety of actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses 
among the methods that we have used are bornhuetter ferguson method paid development method reported development method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive method generally  methods such as the bornheutter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
each of these methods treats our assumptions differently  and thus provides a different perspective for our reserve review 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends 
in performing these analyses we partition our business by coverage type  geography  layer of coverage and accident year 
this procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
for each partition  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management s judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate from the set of possible outcomes produced by the various actuarial methods is based upon the judgment of management and is not driven by formulaic determination 
for each partition of our business we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the partition of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates 
this series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point reserve estimates for our professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among our geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 

table of contents we have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our reserve for losses 
the high and low end points of the distributions are as follows low end point carried reserve high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion the claims environment in which we and others in our industry operate is inherently uncertain 
the development of a statistical distribution models the uncertainty as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data 
the distributions represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes and should not be confused with a range of best estimates 
given the number of factors considered it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
any change in our estimate of the reserve is reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
reinsurance we use insurance and reinsurance collectively  reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december  all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our insurance and reinsurance programs 
we base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
as losses are paid  the related amount expected to be collected from reinsurers is recorded as a receivable in other assets 
we estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements wherein the premium due to the reinsurer  subject to certain maximums and minimums  is based in part on losses reimbursed or to be reimbursed under the agreement 
our estimates of the amounts due from and to reinsurers are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
our assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer  publicly available financial and rating agency data  our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies  and responses by reinsurers 
appropriate reserves are established for balances we believe may not be collected 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
any adjustments are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 

table of contents investment valuations we evaluate our investments on at least a quarterly basis for declines in fair value below cost for the purpose of determining whether these declines represent other than temporary declines 
some of the factors we consider in the evaluation of our investments are the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost basis  the length of time for which the fair value of the investment has been less than its cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer underlying the investment  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
determining whether a decline in the fair value of investments is an other than temporary decline may also involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded in established markets 
for example  assessing the value of certain investments requires us to perform an analysis of expected future cash flows or prepayments 
other investments  such as collateralized mortgage or bond obligations  represent selected tranches of structured transactions supported overall by underlying investments in a wide variety of issuers 
when we judge a decline in fair value below cost to be other than temporary we reduce the cost basis of the investment to fair value and recognize a loss in the current period income statement for the amount of the reduction 
in subsequent periods  we base any measurement of gain or loss or decline in value upon the adjusted cost basis of the investment 
our specific accounting policies related to our invested assets are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries  which are primarily and directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets we make an annual assessment as to whether the value of our goodwill assets is impaired 
we completed such assessments in  and and concluded that the value of our goodwill assets related to continuing operations was not impaired 
as of december  goodwill totaled approximately million 
we use market based valuation models to estimate the fair value 
these models require the use of numerous assumptions regarding market perceptions of value as related to our consolidated and reporting unit historical and projected operating results and those of other economically similar entities 
changes to these assumptions could significantly lower our estimates of fair value and result in a determination that goodwill has suffered impairment in value 
any determined impairment would be reflected as an expense in the period identified 

table of contents proassurance overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are primarily derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  all of which principally write medical professional liability insurance 
corporate strategy our mission is to be the preferred source of professional liability protection by providing unparalleled claims defense  highly responsive customer service and innovative risk management while maintaining our commitment to long term financial strength 
according to am best s analysis of data  we are the fourth largest medical liability insurance writer in the nation  and we believe we are the largest medical liability writer in our collective states of operation 
we believe that our strong reputation in our regional markets  combined with our financial strength  strong customer service and proven ability to manage claims  should enable us  over the long term  to profitably expand our position in select states 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and believe our financial size and strength make us an attractive acquirer 
we emphasize disciplined underwriting and do not manage our business to achieve a certain level of premium growth or market share 
we apply our local knowledge to individual risk selection and determine the appropriate price based on our assessment of the specific characteristics of each risk 
in addition to prudent risk selection  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management 
we investigate each claim and have fostered a strong culture of defending claims that we believe have no merit 
we manage claims at the local level  tailoring claims handling to the legal climate of each state  which we believe differentiates us from national writers 
through our regional underwriting and claims office structure  we are able to gain a strong understanding of local market conditions and efficiently adapt our underwriting and claims strategies to regional conditions 
our regional presence also allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers and be more responsive to their needs 
we believe these factors allow us to compete on a basis other than just price 
we also believe that our presence in local markets allows us to monitor and understand changes in the liability climate and thus develop better business strategies in a timely manner 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the strong ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we intend to manage our business to protect our financial security 
we measure performance in a number of ways  but particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a long term average roe of to 
we believe that a focus on rate adequacy  selective underwriting and effective claims management is required if we are to achieve our roe targets 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and acquisition  underwriting and insurance expenses 
our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety  liquidity  duration and portfolio diversification 
we engage in activities that generate other income  however  such activities  principally fee and agency services  do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits 
growth opportunities and outlook we expect our long term growth to come through controlled expansion in states where we are already writing business and into additional states within  or adjacent to  our existing business footprint 
we also look to expand through the acquisition of other companies or books of business  however  such expansion is opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we face price based competition in virtually all of our markets  with some competitors offering coverage at rates that we believe do not meet our long term profitability goals 
additionally  a number of physicians and hospitals are seeking to lower their costs through the use of alternative risk transfer 
table of contents approaches such as self insurance and risk sharing pools  although these alternatives become less attractive as prices soften in the traditional insurance markets 
our on going commitment to adequate rates and strong underwriting standards affects our willingness to write new business and to renew existing business in the face of this price based competition 
improvements in loss cost trends have allowed us to reduce rates in certain markets during and to offer targeted new business and renewal retention programs in selected markets 
while both actions improve policyholder retention  they decrease our average premiums 
the combined effects of lower rates and the challenges of writing new business are expected to cause our gross written premiums to continue to decline in accounting changes we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fas  accounting for income taxes fin as of its effective date  january  fin creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin increased retained earnings and reduced our tax liability by million at january  recent accounting pronouncements and guidance in december the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt the statement on its effective date 
the adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december the fasb issued sfas revised december business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations but retains the fundamental requirement in sfas that the acquisition method referred to as the purchase method in sfas of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas r provides new or additional guidance with respect to business combinations including defining the acquirer in a transaction  the valuation of assets and liabilities when noncontrolling interests exist  the treatment of contingent consideration  the treatment of costs incurred to effect the acquisition  the treatment of reorganization costs  and the valuation of assets and liabilities when the purchase price is below the net fair value of assets acquired 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt the statement on its effective date 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas allows many financial assets and liabilities and other items to be reported at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value  unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas also establishes new disclosure requirements with respect to fair values 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   unless early adopted 
we will adopt sfas on its effective date 
upon adoption  we do not plan to select the fair value alternative for any financial assets or liabilities that are not currently measured at fair value 
we do not expect adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
the standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements

recent significant events effective january   we sold our personal lines operations and recognized a gain on the sale of million after consideration of sales expenses and estimated taxes 
additional information regarding the sale is provided in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective august  we acquired physicians insurance company of wisconsin  inc pic wisconsin in an all stock merger 
the acquisition of pic wisconsin allowed proassurance to expand its medical professional liability business into the state of wisconsin and adjacent states and into nevada 
this transaction strategically expanded our geographic footprint and was in keeping with our desire to expand our professional liability operations through selective acquisitions 
a more detailed description of the merger transaction is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of we reached a confidential settlement that ended all litigation and appeals stemming from  and related to  a million judgment on a malpractice verdict against insureds of one of our subsidiaries entered in tampa  florida in october the effect of the settlement has been reflected in our financial statements 
on april  our board authorized million to repurchase our shares or debt securities 
the timing and quantity of any repurchase is dependent upon market conditions and any changes in proassurance s capital requirements  as well as limitations imposed by applicable securities laws and regulations  and the rules of the new york stock exchange 
as of december  we have repurchased approximately million common shares at a total cost of approximately million 
on december  we utilized approximately million of the authorization to redeem our outstanding subordinated debentures

reclassifications due to the increasing significance of the amounts involved  for all periods presented  we have separately stated our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
previously  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries were included as a component of other investments  and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries were considered as a component of net investment income 
the reclassification had no effect on income from continuing operations  net income or total assets 
liquidity and capital resources and financial condition overview proassurance corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because it has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limitation by state insurance regulations 
see our discussions under regulation of dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries in part i  and in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the ordinary dividends that can be paid by our insurance subsidiaries in at december  we held cash and investments of approximately million outside of our insurance subsidiaries that are available for use without regulatory approval 

table of contents cash flows the principal components of our cash flow are the excess of net investment income and premiums collected over net losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the ultimate payment of losses 
premiums are generally collected within the twelve month period after the policy is written while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time 
likewise timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of reinsurance recoveries 
our operating activities provided positive cash flows of approximately million during the year ended december   which is composed of million from routine insurance operations and proceeds of million related to the sale of trading securities 
in  cash provided by operating activities of million is composed of net positive cash flows from routine insurance operations of million  offset by tax payments related to the sale of our personal lines operations of approximately million and purchases of trading securities of approximately million 
exclusive of cash flows related to trading securities and the taxes paid on the meemic transaction  the decline in operating cash flows during is principally attributable to an increase in payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance reimbursements received 
a number of factors influenced the increase in losses paid  including an additional seven months of pic wisconsin payment activity  the maturing of claims incurred during the last several years of growth  and an increase in the number of large indemnity payments  net of amounts received from reinsurers 
two metrics commonly used to analyze the operating cash flows of insurance companies are the paid to incurred ratio and the paid loss ratio 
year ended december paid to incurred ratio paid loss ratio our paid to incurred and paid loss ratios are higher in than in primarily due to the increase in net loss payments 
the ratios also increased in because the denominators of each ratio net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the paid to incurred ratio  net earned premiums for the paid loss ratio decreased in as compared to for a long tailed business such as proassurance  the ratios for a short period of time should not be viewed in isolation 
both changes in premium volume and the recognition of reserve development can impact the calculation of these ratios 
the timing of our indemnity payments is affected by many factors  including the nature and number of the claims in process in any one period and the speed at which cases work through the trial and appellate process 
in the contractual obligations table included in part ii of our december  form k we projected  largely based on historical payment patterns  that we would pay gross losses of million during related to the reserves that were established at december  actual gross loss and loss adjustment expenses paid during were million  which  while lower than our estimate  reflects the unpredictable nature of our business 
cash flows in were also reduced due to a decline in premium receipts 
these decreases to operating cash flows were partially offset by growth in cash flows from investment earnings  and a reduction in premium payments to our reinsurers 
investments we manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
at our insurance subsidiaries the primary outflow of cash is related to net losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments 
to the extent that we have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under previously established borrowing arrangements 
however  given the relatively short duration of our investments  we do not foresee any such shortfall 

table of contents we invest most of the cash generated from operations into debt and equity securities 
we held cash and short term securities of million at december  as compared to million at december  since december  we have held additional funds in our short term portfolio both as a means of managing the duration of our overall investment portfolio  and as a means of increasing our flexibility in a volatile investment market 
during we sold the securities held in our fixed maturities trading portfolio primarily treasury indexed because we believed active trading of these securities no longer offered superior returns 
other investments increased from million at december  to million at december  in january we contributed high yield asset backed bonds from our available for sale investment portfolio to a fund created for the purpose of managing such investments 
we maintain a direct beneficial interest in securities originally contributed to the fund  which are included in our balance sheet as a component of other investments at fair value million at december  
cash flows from our initial investment in the fund  which approximate million at december   are being re invested in an undivided interest of the fund 
the undivided interest is considered as an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary and is accounted for using the equity method 
as of december  our available for sale fixed maturity securities of billion comprise of our total investments 
the approximate million net increase as compared to our december  holdings reflects the investment of operating cash flows  as well as an increase in fair value attributable to lower interest rates as discussed below 
substantially all of our fixed maturities are either united states government agency obligations or investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
our available for sale fixed maturities have a dollar weighted average rating of aa at december  the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years  the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities and our short term securities combined is years 
changes in market interest rate levels generally affect our net income to the extent that reinvestment yields are different than the yields on maturing securities 
changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed maturity securities 
on a pre tax basis  net unrealized gains on our available for sale fixed maturity securities are comprised as follows in millions year ended december gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses net unrealized gains losses approximately of the unrealized loss positions in our portfolio are interest rate related 
we have the intent and  due to the duration of our overall portfolio and positive operating cash flows  believe we have the ability  to hold these bonds to recovery of book value or maturity and do not consider the declines in value to be other than temporary 
for a discussion of the potential effects that future changes in interest rates may have on our investment portfolio see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   our fixed maturity securities include securities with a fair value of approximately million including unrealized losses of million that are supported by collateral we classify as sub prime  of which approximately are aaa rated  are aa  and are a 
additionally  we have approximately million including unrealized losses of million of securities exposure to below investment grade fixed income securities with sub prime exposure within a high yield investment fund  the average rating of the securities is bb 
in  we evaluated our exposure to the sub prime market and determined that million of writedowns were warranted for other than temporary impairments 
we have no exposure to sub prime through collateralized debt obligations 
equity investments represent less than of our total investments and less than of our stockholders equity at both december  and at december   the carrying value of our equity investments including equities in our available for sale and trading portfolios totaled million as compared to million at december  
table of contents losses the following table  known as the reserve development table  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period

ncric reserves are included only in the year and thereafter 
pic wisconsin reserves are included in the year and thereafter 
the table does not include the reserves of personal lines operations  which are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserve for losses to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following may be helpful in understanding the reserve development table the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as showing in our consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year

table of contents in each year reflected in the table  we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the actuarial methodologies discussed in critical accounting estimates 
these techniques are applied to the data in a consistent manner and the resulting projections are evaluated by management to establish the estimate of reserve 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve medical malpractice claims and include the following reserves in the earlier years of the table include prior accident year amounts dating back to the mid and late s 
when these reserves were originally established  our estimates were strongly influenced by dramatic increases to frequency and severity trends that we  and the industry as a whole  experienced in the mid s 
some of these trends moderated  and in some cases  reversed  in the late s or early s  but the extended time required for claims resolution delayed our recognition of the improved environment prior to the mid to late s our business was largely based in alabama 
when we began to expand geographically  we utilized industry based data as well as our own data to support our actuarial projection process 
our own claims experience proved to be better than the projected experience  but again  this was not known for some time after the reserves were established 
ultimately  as actual results proved better than that suggested by historical trends and industry claims data  redundancies developed and were recognized 
the medical professional liability legal environment deteriorated once again in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
as a result  favorable development of prior year reserves slowed in and reversed in and we have addressed these trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
during  and we have recognized favorable development related to our previously established reserves for accident years through because we have reduced our estimates of claims severity related to those years 
based on recent internal and industry claims data  we believe claims severity ie  the average size of a claim is increasing at a rate slower than we estimated when our reserves for those years were established 

table of contents activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized below in thousands year ended december balance  beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers net balance  beginning of year reserves acquired from acquisitions  net of receivable from reinsurers of million in and million in incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus receivable from reinsurers balance  end of year at december  our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately billion and ibnr reserves of approximately billion 
our consolidated reserve for losses on a gaap basis exceeds the combined reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of the gaap reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability  or retirement of an insured 
reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we generally reinsure professional liability risks under annual treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  per claim retention levels have varied between the first  and the first million depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
periodically  we provide insurance to policyholders above the maximum limits of our primary reinsurance treaties 
in those situations  we reinsure the excess risk above the limits of our reinsurance treaties on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk appetite and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience and our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state 
our reinsurance treaties renewed on october  without significant change in cost or structure 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
our reinsurance broker assists us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers

however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate

litigation we are involved in various legal actions arising primarily from claims against us related to insurance policies and claims handling  including  but not limited to  claims asserted by our policyholders 
legal actions are generally divided into two categories legal actions dealing with claims and claim related actions which we consider in our evaluation of our reserve for losses and legal actions falling outside of these areas which we evaluate and reserve for separately as a part of our other liabilities 
claim related actions are considered as a part of our reserving process under the guidance provided by sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
we evaluate the likely outcomes from these actions giving consideration to the facts and laws applicable to each case  appellate issues  coverage issues  potential recoveries from our insurance and reinsurance programs  and settlement discussions as well as our historical claims resolution practices 
this data is then given consideration in the overall evaluation of our reserve for losses 
for non claim related actions we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve under the guidance provided by sfas accounting for contingencies 
as a result of the acquisition of ncric  proassurance assumed the risk of loss for a judgment entered against ncric on february  by a district of columbia superior court in favor of columbia hospital for women medical center  inc chw in the amount of million the chw judgment 
the chw judgment is now on appeal to the district of columbia court of appeals 
proassurance has established a liability for this judgment of million  which includes the estimated costs associated with pursuing the post trial motions or appeal of a final judgment and projected post trial interest  million of which was established as a component of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the allocation of the ncric purchase price 
there are risks  as outlined in our risk factors  that individual actions could cost us more than our estimates 
in particular  we or our insureds may receive adverse verdicts  post trial motions may be denied  in whole or in part  any appeals that may be undertaken may be unsuccessful  we may be unsuccessful in our legal efforts to limit the scope of coverage available to insureds  and we may become a party to bad faith litigation over the settlement of a claim 
to the extent that the cost of resolving these 
table of contents actions exceeds our estimates  the legal actions could have a material effect on proassurance s results of operations in the period in which any such action is resolved

income from continuing operations per diluted share increased to from for the same comparative period 
our results benefited from an increased amount of favorable loss development 
we recognized favorable loss development in of million as compared to million in also  net investment income increased by almost million in due to growth in our invested assets and a modest improvement in yields 
these benefits were partially offset by a decline in net premiums earned of million  an increase in our current year loss ratio of approximately percentage points and an increase in our expense ratio of almost percentage points

table of contents premiums in thousands year ended december change gross premiums written premiums earned premiums ceded net premiums earned gross written premiums premiums written declined during as compared to due to the effects of increased competition and rate reductions 
additional premiums from the acquisition of pic wisconsin partially offset the reduction in premium in our existing book of business 
the operations of pic wisconsin are included for twelve months in versus five months in in periods of market softening  our strategy is to maintain our underwriting and pricing discipline and grow primarily through selective acquisitions 
we face strong price based competition in virtually all of our markets  with some competitors offering coverage at rates that we do not believe to be profitable on a long term basis 
additionally  a number of physicians and hospitals are seeking to lower their costs through the use of alternative risk transfer approaches such as self insurance and risk sharing pools  although these alternatives become less attractive as prices soften in the traditional insurance markets 
our ongoing commitment to adequate rates and strong underwriting standards affects our willingness to write new business and to renew existing business in the face of this price based competition 
improvements in loss cost trends have allowed us to reduce rates in certain markets during and to offer targeted new business and renewal retention programs in selected markets 
while this improves retention of business  it decreases our average premium rates 
the combined effects of lower rates and the challenges of writing new business are expected to cause our gross written premiums to continue to decline in physician premiums represent and of gross written premiums for the years ended december  and  respectively

we are required to offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  but we do not market such coverages separately 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 
because of this volatility  we separate premiums associated with tail coverages from our other premiums 
in  tail premiums totaled million of gross written premiums  a decrease of million as compared to premiums earned in thousands year ended december change premiums earned pra pre acquisition business pic wisconsin acquisition    n a because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
our policies generally carry a term of one year 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
exclusive of the effect of tail premiums  the decline in premiums earned in reflects on a pro rata basis declines in gross premiums written during and  as well as reduced earned premium benefit related to acquisitions 
in the twelve months that follow the acquisition of an insurance subsidiary  our premiums earned include premiums related to the subsidiary s unexpired policies on the date of acquisition unearned premium 
such premiums are earned over the remaining term of the associated policy 
in  earned premium includes approximately million related to the unexpired policies acquired in the pic wisconsin transaction 
in  earned premium includes approximately million related to unexpired policies acquired in the pic wisconsin and ncric transactions 
as discussed under gross premiums written  our written premiums declined in  consequently  premiums earned are likely to decrease during 
table of contents premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period premiums due to the reinsurer are estimated 
ceded premium estimates are revised as loss estimates are revised 
during  we reduced premiums ceded by approximately million due to the commutation of certain reinsurance arrangements 
during we reduced premiums ceded by approximately million due to the commutation of certain reinsurance arrangements 
we increased ceded premiums by million in and reduced ceded premiums by million in to reflect changes to our estimates of the amount of reinsurance premiums due for prior accident years 
the amount of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years can vary significantly because certain prior year reinsurance agreements adjust premiums based on loss experience  others do not 
also we have reached premium maximums for certain agreements  but not for others

net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income the increase in net investment income from fixed maturities reflects both higher average invested funds and improved yields 
the positive cash flows from our insurance operations and the pic wisconsin merger significantly increased average invested funds during as compared to market interest rates of the past several years have allowed us to consistently invest new and matured funds at rates that exceed the average held in our portfolio 
average yields for our available for sale fixed maturity securities during and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield the small decline in investment income from short term investments reflects lower average balances in income from other invested assets is principally derived from non public investment partnerships limited liability companies accounted for on a cost basis 
because we recognize income related to these investments as it is distributed to us  our income from these holdings varies from period to period 
business owned life insurance is lower in due to a one time reduction in the growth of cash surrender values due to a restructuring of this portfolio

table of contents losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
in millions net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december change change current accident year prior accident years calendar year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
our current accident year loss ratio has increased in as compared to for several reasons 
we have booked higher initial loss ratios in the states in which pic wisconsin operates as we wait for the impact of our post acquisition rate filings in those states to take effect 
the ratio is also impacted by an increase in our estimates for losses in excess of policy limits as compared to the prior year and an increase in the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision ddr in our claims made policies 
pic wisconsin accounted for approximately million and million of our calendar year net losses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pic wisconsin is included in our results for all months of our fiscal year as compared to only months during based upon recent claims data  both internal and industry figures  we have reduced our expectation of claims severity 
as a result during calendar year we recognized net favorable development of million generally related to our previously established prior accident year reserves 
in particular we have observed claims severity  within the first million of coverage  for the through accident years below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of claims  we are generally cautious in recognizing the impact of the underlying trends that lead to the recognition of favorable development 
as we conclude that sufficient data with respect to these trends exists to credibly impact our actuarial analysis we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends for  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining cautious about the past volatility of claims severity 
in our exposures greater than million  which are generally reinsured with third parties  we observed a trend that was somewhat counter to the trend discussed above 
in particular  given the number of large verdicts experienced by the industry we increased our reserves for these exposures resulting in a million increase to gross losses 
the effect of this increase was largely offset by a corresponding increase to the anticipated recoverables from our reinsurers 
our analysis of data indicates increased claims severity and frequency trends related to losses in both categories 
we believe the recognition of these trends represents a cautious approach to what we are observing 

table of contents during the year ended december  we recognized net favorable development of million related to our previously established prior accident year reserves  primarily to reflect reductions in our estimates of claim severity  within our retained layer of risk  for the  and accident years 
in  we also recognized million decrease to gross losses which was offset by a corresponding decrease to the recoverable from our reinsurer 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting expense ratio year ended december year ended december change change   n a underwriting  operating and acquisition expenses remained fairly flat in as compared to the most significant changes between the two periods are an increase in stock based compensation costs million  a decrease in expenses related to guaranty fund assessments million  and lower acquisition expenses due to the decrease in premiums earned million 
the increase in underwriting expense ratio is primarily due to the effect of lower premium volume in the pic wisconsin acquisition has little effect on the underwriting expense ratio 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses include stock based compensation expense of approximately million in and million in in  we awarded  vested options to our new ceo 
the options were fully expensed in  which increased underwriting expenses by million and increased the underwriting expense ratio by points 
also  million of stock based compensation expense for relates to awards given to employees who are eligible for retirement as compared to  in awards issued to retirement eligible employees are expensed when granted rather than over the vesting period of the award 
net guaranty fund assessments totaled approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease reflects lower assessments during the year as well as a benefit of approximately  for amounts recouped from our insureds related to assessments from the florida insurance guaranty association  inc guaranty fund 
expenses for the years ended december  and included florida assessments of million and million  respectively 

table of contents interest expense approximately  of the increase in interest expense is related to long term debt million assumed in the pic wisconsin merger 
interest expense also increased because our subordinated debentures carry variable rates based on libor and the average libor reset rate for our debt increased an average of approximately half a percentage point in as compared to interest expense by debt obligation is provided in the following table in thousands year ended december change convertible debentures subordinated debentures subordinated debentures surplus notes other taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt

our results for the year ended december  include ncric results only for the five month period subsequent to the date of acquisition 
during  as a means of effectively utilizing capital  a number of policies previously written by ncric have been renewed through our other insurance subsidiaries and ncric s administrative and operating functions have  in many instances  been combined with those of our other insurance operations

physician premiums comprised of total premiums in and of total premiums in in thousands year ended december change physician premiums pra pre acquisition business pic wisconsin acquisition   n a exclusive of tail premiums the overall increase in physician premiums reflects additional premiums from the pic wisconsin and ncric acquisitions offset by a decrease in premiums written in our organic book of business 
the decline in physician premiums in our organic book of business is attributable to several factors 
in  our rate increases were not at a level that would offset the effects of lost business 
loss costs have moderated somewhat and  as a result  we have implemented smaller rate increases than in prior years and have held rates constant or lowered rates in some markets 
our average rate increase on physician renewals exclusive of pic wisconsin is approximately for as compared to for premiums written for physician coverages have also declined due to an increasingly competitive landscape 
in a number of our markets established providers have become more aggressive and new providers  including off shore providers  self insurance and risk retention groups  have begun to pursue business 
the additional competition  which is frequently focused on price  has reduced both our retention rate and the amount of new business we have chosen to write 
we are focused on marketing our policies based on our stability  strength and policyholder defense 
however  we remain committed to an adequate rate structure and will continue our policy of foregoing business that cannot be written at our profit goals 
our overall retention rate exclusive of pic wisconsin for the number of standard physician risks that we insure is for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the competitive pricing in the marketplace makes it more difficult for us to attract new business 

table of contents premiums written for non physician coverages totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and include premiums attributable to the pic wisconsin acquisition as follows in thousands year ended december change non physician premiums hospital coverages pra pre acquisition business pic wisconsin acquisition   n a other non physician coverages pra pre acquisition business pic wisconsin acquisition   n a exclusive of tail premiums excluding premiums written by pic wisconsin  the decline in hospital and facility coverages of million is largely due to the nonrenewal of two large policies 
this segment of business is highly price sensitive and individual policies for these coverages can carry large amounts of premiums 
as in all our lines  we choose not to compete primarily on price because our focus is on maintaining adequate margins on the policies we sell 
thus  premiums for these coverages can fluctuate widely from period to period 
extended reporting endorsement or tail policies are offered to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us 
the amount of tail premium written in any annual period varies  but represented approximately of total premiums in both and as competition in the medical professional liability industry has intensified  it is common for insurers to write prior acts coverage to new insureds  which has reduced the amount of tail premium that we write 
our preference is to sell less rather than more of this coverage since it represents a long term liability with increased pricing risk 
tail premiums  exclusive of pic wisconsin  declined by approximately million in as compared to premiums earned because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
our policies generally carry a term of one year 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
in the twelve months that follow the acquisition of an insurance subsidiary  our premiums earned include premiums earned related to the subsidiary s unexpired policies on the date of acquisition unearned premium 
such premiums are earned over the remaining term of the associated policy 
in thousands year ended december change premiums earned pra pre acquisition business pic wisconsin acquisition   n a premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in reflects the changes in written premiums that have occurred during and  on a pro rata basis  as well as the premiums earned related to the unexpired policies acquired in the pic wisconsin and ncric transactions 
such additional earned premium approximated million for the year ended december  and approximated million for the year ended december  
table of contents premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the amount of premium that is due to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience of the business ceded to them 
we reduced ceded premiums by million in to reflect changes in our estimates of the amount of reinsurance premiums due for certain prior accident years  based on the provisions of the reinsurance contracts and our estimates of the reinsured losses for those prior accident years 
we also reduced ceded premiums in by million related to the commutation of all of our outstanding reinsurance arrangements with the converium group of companies 
after adjustment for these two items  and excluding pic wisconsin  ceded premiums are of earned premiums as compared to approximately in the difference is largely due to improved loss experience relative to business we ceded to reinsurers in which resulted in a lower amount of ceded premium 
net investment income  net realized investment gains losses  equity loss in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries net investment income in thousands year ended december change net investment income pra pre acquisition business pic wisconsin acquisition   n a consolidated net investment income is primarily derived from the interest income earned by our fixed maturity securities and includes interest income from short term  trading portfolio and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  earnings from other investments and increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts 
investment fees and expenses are deducted from investment income 
the increase in net investment income for the year as compared to is due to several factors  the most significant being higher average invested funds 
the proceeds from the sale of the meemic companies received in early january  the pic wisconsin and ncric mergers  and positive cash flow generated by our insurance operations significantly increased our average invested funds during rising market interest rates of the past several years have further contributed to the improvement in net investment income 
we have been able to invest new and matured funds at higher rates and this has steadily increased the average yield of our portfolio 
our average yields for the years ended december  and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield 
table of contents net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income pic wisconsin investment income is almost entirely derived from fixed maturities 
other than the effect of pic wisconsin  the variations in the categories between years largely reflect growth of our investment portfolio and improved yields as already discussed 
income from short term investments increased during largely because proceeds from the sale of our personal lines segment were invested in short term investments during most of which increased average invested balances  but also increased as a result of higher yields and additional income from pic wisconsin

table of contents losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with our estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
calendar year results include the operating results for the current accident year and any changes in estimates related to prior accident years

we focus on developing and maintaining adequate rates 
exclusive of pic wisconsin  as a percentage of net earned premiums the net loss ratio current accident year net losses have declined points during this decline in the pra current accident year net loss ratio is attributable to the improved rate adequacy of premiums earned in the decrease in the dollar amount of pra current accident year net losses for principally reflects decreases in the number of insured risks in as compared to pic wisconsin s current accident year net loss ratio is higher than that of our other subsidiaries for a number of reasons 
pic wisconsin losses for prior accident years developed adversely during  in the amount of million 
because pic wisconsin was acquired by pra during  these losses are considered to be current year losses for pra 
as a result of this loss development  pic wisconsin incurred additional reinsurance expense under the retrospective premium provisions of its reinsurance contracts 
the combination of increased net losses and reduced net premium resulted in an unusually high loss ratio 
rate increases have been implemented in an attempt to bring pic wisconsin s loss ratio to more acceptable levels 
during calendar year we recognized favorable development of million related to our previously established prior accident year reserves  primarily to reflect reductions in our estimates of claim severity  within our retained layer of risk  for the  and accident years 
over the past several years we have seen claims severity ie  the average size of a claim increase at a rate slower than initially expected 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of claims  we are generally cautious in recognizing the impact of the underlying trends that lead to the recognition of favorable development 
as we conclude that sufficient data with respect to these trends exists to credibly impact our actuarial analysis we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends for  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the favorable impact of trends on prior period loss estimates while also remaining cautious about the past volatility of claims severity 
while we have begun to see an increase in the number of larger verdicts being rendered this has not had a meaningful impact on the severity of claims within the first million of risk 

table of contents during  we have seen an increased number of verdicts in excess of the policy limits that we offer to our insureds 
as a part of our reserving process we evaluate the likely outcomes from these verdicts giving consideration to appellate issues  coverage issues  potential recoveries from our insurance and reinsurance programs  and settlement discussions as well as our historical claims resolution practices 
this information is then used in evaluating the overall adequacy of our reserve 
in the risk layers above million  generally the business for which we purchase reinsurance  we recognized approximately million of favorable development of gross losses  offset by a corresponding decrease in the recoverable from our reinsurers 
our analysis of the long term data does indicate an overall improvement in the severity trends at this level  despite the increased frequency of verdicts in excess of policy limits  and we believe the amount of favorable development represents a cautious recognition of this trend within the excess layers 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
two measures often used to gauge insurance operations are the paid to incurred ratio and the paid loss ratio 
these ratios are affected by changes in the timing and volume of losses paid  which generally relate to losses incurred in prior periods  and by changes in the level of incurred losses paid to incurred ratio or the volume of premiums earned the paid loss ratio in the current calendar year 
our paid to incurred loss ratios for the years ended december  and are and  respectively 
our paid loss ratio for the years ended december  and are and  respectively 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses the increase in underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses for reflects additional costs related to the addition of ncric and pic wisconsin operations  higher compensation costs  principally from the recognition of stock based compensation costs  and an increase in guaranty fund assessments 
the increase in the underwriting expense ratio for is attributable to higher compensation costs referred to above and additionally the increase in guaranty fund assessments 
the additional ncric and pic wisconsin expenses had little effect on the expense ratio due to the corresponding increase in earned premium resulting from the acquisition

we previously valued stock option awards based on their intrinsic value which generally did not result in compensation expense related to those awards 
stock based compensation expense increased our expenses by

interest expense interest expense increased approximately million during as compared to due to debt we assumed in our acquisitions of ncric principal of million in august and pic wisconsin principal of million in august 
interest expense also increased because our subordinated debentures carry variable rates based on libor and the libor reset rate for our outstanding debt increased an average of approximately percentage points in as compared to interest expense by debt obligation is provided in the following table in thousands year ended december change convertible debentures subordinated debentures subordinated debentures surplus notes other taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt 
the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily the result of our tax exempt income being a smaller percentage of total income than in prior periods 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position  we have the current ability and intent to hold such securities until recovery of book value or maturity 
the following table summarizes estimated changes in the fair value of our available for sale and trading fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  in millions  except duration december  december  portfolio change in effective portfolio effective interest rates value value duration value duration basis point rise basis point rise current rate basis point decline basis point decline current rates are as of december  and december  computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed maturity securities are rated investment grade as determined by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  even investment grade securities can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities include securities with a fair value of approximately million including unrealized losses of million that are supported by collateral we classify as sub prime  of which approximately are aaa rated  are aa  and are a 
additionally  we have approximately million including unrealized losses of million of exposure to below investment grade fixed income securities with sub prime exposure within a high yield investment fund  the average rating of these securities is bb 
in  we evaluated our exposure to the sub prime market and determined that million of writedowns were warranted for other than temporary impairments 
we have no exposure to sub prime loans through collateralized debt obligations 

table of contents equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in fair value due to a decline in equity prices 
the weighted average beta of this group of securities is 
beta measures the price sensitivity of an equity security or group of equity securities to a change in the broader equity market  in this case the s p index 
if the value of the s p index increased by  the fair value of these securities would be expected to increase by to million 
conversely  a decrease in the s p index would imply a decrease of in the fair value of these securities to million 
the selected hypothetical changes of plus or minus do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios and are used for illustrative purposes only
