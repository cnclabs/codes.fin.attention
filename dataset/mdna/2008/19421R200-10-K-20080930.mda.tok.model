item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business collectors universe  inc we  us or the company provides grading and authentication services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps  and vintage us currency notes and to sellers and purchasers of diamonds and colored gemstones 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles and to diamonds and colored gemstones by enhancing their marketability and  thereby  providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own  buy and sell them 
we generate revenues principally from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our websites  the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications  the sale of collectors club membership  subscriptions to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market  for certified coins product revenues that we generate from sales primarily of coins that we purchase under our warranty policy  and revenues that we generate from the collectibles trade show conventions that we conduct 
recent business acquisitions 
on july  we purchased  for an aggregate purchase price of  substantially all the assets of coinfacts 
com  which operated an internet website on which it published detailed proprietary information and history on us coins 
on september  we acquired  for an aggregate purchase price of  the common stock of certified coin exchange cce  which operates a subscription based dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for third party certified coins 
on november  we acquired gem certification appraisal lab gcal  a gemological certification and grading laboratory 
as part of that transaction  we also acquired diamond profile laboratory  inc dpl  a scientific diamond light performance analysis laboratory  and all publishing and other rights to palmieri s market monitor  an educational and informative industry publication 
we paid an aggregate acquisition price of  in cash for gcal  dpl and the publishing and other rights to palmieri s market monitor 
on december  we acquired the business and substantially all of the assets of gemprint corporation gemprint  consisting primarily of a patented technology for non invasive diamond identification which gemprint uses to digitally capture the unique refractive light pattern or gemprint of each diamond that is processed with that technology 
we paid an aggregate purchase price for gemprint s business and assets of  in cash  assumed certain pre acquisition liabilities and lease commitments  and agreed to pay additional contingent purchase price of for each diamond that we register using the gemprint process in excess of  registrations per year during the five year period ending december  effective july  we acquired  for an aggregate purchase price of  in cash  all of the outstanding ownership interests of expos unlimited llc expos  a california limited liability company engaged in the business of owning and conducting collectibles trade shows and conventions 
depending on the future revenue performance of expos  we may become obligated to make contingent payments to the former owners of expos up to an aggregate of  in july expos owns and operates the long beach coin  stamp collectibles expo long beach and the santa clara coin  stamp collectibles expo santa clara  which comprise  in total  five trade shows that are held annually 
on august   we acquired american gemological laboratories agl  an international colored gemstone certification and grading laboratory 
agl is one of the leading third party authentication and grading services for colored gemstones  including colored gemstones that are sold at auction through sotheby s and christie s and by jewelry retailers such as cartier and fred leighton 
we paid an aggregate acquisition price of  in cash for agl  and  depending on the future revenue performance of agl  we may become obligated to make payments of up to an aggregate of an additional  over the next five years 
the operating results of these acquired businesses have been consolidated into our operating results from the respective dates of their acquisition discontinued operations 
as previously disclosed  in fiscal our board of directors authorized the divestiture of our collectibles auctions and sales businesses 
as a result  we sold our collectibles sales businesses during that year  but retained the collectibles inventory and accounts receivable of those businesses  which have since been substantially liquidated 
the activities resulting from the divestiture of those businesses have been classified as discontinued operations and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on our authentication and grading businesses  which comprise substantially all of our continuing operations 
factors that can affect our financial position and operating results factors that can affect our revenues 
our revenues are comprised of i fees generated by the authentication and grading of high value collectibles  and other high value assets consisting of diamonds and colored gemstones  and ii to a lesser extent  revenues from sales of collectibles club memberships  advertising on our websites and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription based revenues primarily related to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for collectible coins certified by us  fees earned from the management  operation and promotion of collectibles trade shows and conventions and revenues from sales of products  which consist primarily of coins that we purchase under our warranty policy 
our authentication and grading revenues accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the amounts of such revenues are primarily affected by i the volume and mix  among coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and other collectibles and diamonds and colored gemstones  on the other hand  of authentication and grading submissions  ii in the case of coins and sportscards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  and iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions  as vintage or classic collectibles are of significantly higher value and are more saleable by dealers than modern coins and sportscards 
six of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted  in the aggregate  for approximately of our total net revenues in the fiscal year ended june  as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a significant decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  would cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our results of operations 
our revenues from these customers are also impacted by the level of submissions and revenue earned from submissions at collectibles trade shows where we provide on site grading and authentication services to show attendees who typically request same day turn around 
the level of submissions can vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of the shows or short term decisions made by dealers during shows 
in addition  the level of our revenues can be impacted by short term changes in the price of gold that may occur around the time of the show  which can affect the volume of coin transactions from these customers at the shows and which  in turn  can affect the volume of submissions to us for on site grading and same day turn around 
factors affecting our gross profit margins 
the gross profit margins on authentication and grading submissions also are primarily affected by i the volume and mix  among coins  sportscards and other collectibles and high value assets  of authentication and grading submissions  because we generally realize higher margins on coin submissions than on submissions of other collectibles and high value assets  ii in the case of coins and sportscards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times  iii the mix of authentication and grading submissions between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand  because dealers generally request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions  and iv the stage of development and the seasonality of our newly acquired businesses 
furthermore  because a significant proportion of our direct costs are fixed in nature  our gross profit is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles authenticated and graded in any period 
impact of economic conditions on financial performance 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the collectibles and the diamond and colored gemstone markets 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by the financial performance of those markets  which depends to a great extent on i discretionary consumer spending and  hence  on the availability of disposable income  ii on other economic conditions  including prevailing interest and inflation rates  which affect consumer confidence  and iii the performance and volatility of the gold and other precious metals markets and the stock markets 
these conditions primarily affect the volume of purchases and sales of collectibles which  in turn  affects the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us  because our services facilitate commerce in collectibles 
accordingly  factors such as improving economic conditions which usually result in increases in disposable income and consumer confidence  and volatility in and declines in the prices of stocks and a weakening in the value of the us dollar  which often lead investors to increase their purchases of precious metals  such as gold bullion and other coins and collectibles  usually result in increases in submissions of collectibles for our services 
by contrast  the volume of collectibles sales and purchases and  therefore  the volume of authentication and grading submissions  usually decline during periods characterized by recessionary economic conditions and by declines in disposable income and consumer confidence or by increasing stock prices and relative stability in the stock markets 
the following tables provide information regarding the respective number of coins  sportscards  autographs  currency  diamonds and colored gemstones that we graded or authenticated in the fiscal years ended june    and and their estimated values  which are the amounts at which those coins  sportscards and stamps and other high value assets were insured by the dealers and collectors who submitted them to us for grading and authentication 
units processed coins sportscards autographs stamps currency diamonds colored gemstones total declared values coins sportscards autographs stamps currency diamonds colored gemstones total we commenced the authentication and grading of diamonds in the second quarter of when we acquired gcal and gemprint 
we commenced the authentication and grading of colored gemstones in the first quarter of  when we acquired agl

amount percent of revenues amount percent of revenues percent change dollars in thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses impairment losses amortization of intangible assets operating loss interest income  net other income loss before benefit for income taxes benefit for income taxes loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net loss net loss per diluted share loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net loss net of gain on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes 
as the above table indicates  we generated a increase in net revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of increases in revenues from i our non grading service businesses  including increased advertising revenues earned on our coin and sportscards publications and increased revenues from our cfc financing activities other related businesses  and ii sales of collectible coins purchased by us under our coin grading warranty policy 
however  despite that increase in net revenues  we incurred an operating loss of  in fiscal  as compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal  due primarily to increased operating losses of  incurred by our diamond and colored gemstones operations  including a  increase in losses from on going operations of those businesses and an impairment loss of approximately  with respect to goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets 
such impairment losses reflected a fair value determination of these two reporting units at june   and a  decrease in operating income generated by our coin grading business in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which was due primarily to a decline in trade show revenues of approximately  in fiscal  and higher costs of sales  which included warranty costs of  recognized in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of certain significant coin warranty claims 
partially offsetting the operating losses attributable to the operations of our authentication and grading businesses was a net improvement in the operating results of our other related businesses and a lower level of unallocated corporate costs 
these  as well as other factors affecting our operating results in the fiscal are described in more detail below 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts and notes receivable and inventories  we must make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or conditions  such as increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for the full effects of such events or changes to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
during fiscal year and in the first quarter of fiscal year  we acquired certain businesses and  in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate amounts paid for those businesses in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  and to classify that excess as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see goodwill below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have definite lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives see long lived assets other than goodwill below 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to on going evaluation for impairment 
management formally evaluates the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the business acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
in the event it was determined  from any such impairment analysis  that the estimated fair value of any such assets had declined below their carrying value  we would be required to recognize an impairment charge that would have the effect of reducing our income in the period when that charge was recognized 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible or high value assets to the customer 
due to the insignificant delay between the completion of our grading and authentication services and the shipment of the collectible or high value asset back to the customer  the time of shipment corresponds to the completion of our services 
many of our authentication and grading customers prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectible items to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until their graded collectibles are shipped back to them and our revenue generating activities are complete 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer as there is no uncertainty surrounding the collection of receivables from these customers 
with respect to our expos trade show business  we recognize revenue generated by the promotion  management and operation of collectibles conventions and trade shows in the periods in which the shows take place  which corresponds with the revenue generating activities being complete 
a portion of our net revenues is comprised of subscription fees paid by customers for memberships in our collectors club 
those memberships entitle members to access our on line and printed publications and  sometimes also to vouchers for free grading services from us 
we record revenue for this multi element service arrangement in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  by recognizing approximately of the subscription fee in the month following the membership purchase  on the basis that collectors club members typically utilize their vouchers for free grading services within days of subscribing for memberships 
we review this estimate at least semi annually by recalculating the percentage based on the relative values of the various elements in the collectors club offering and determining the appropriate percentage to attribute to the grading services and the remaining subscription 
our estimates have proven to be consistently around on an on going basis 
the balance of the membership fee is recognized as revenue over the life of the membership  which can range from one to two years 
we recognize product sales when items are shipped and all the requirements of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  have been satisfied 
product revenues sold consist primarily of collectible coins that we purchased pursuant to our coin authentication and grading warranty program and are not considered an integral part of the company s on going revenue generating activities 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers or distributors who submit collectibles or diamonds or colored gemstones to us for authentication and grading on a recurring basis 
in addition  primarily in connection with our coin dealer financing programs  we make advances or extend credit under notes receivable arrangements 
we regularly review our accounts and notes receivable  estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due amounts  and in the case of notes receivable  the current value of the collateral we hold as security for the payment obligations under the notes receivable  and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes receivable balances 
each quarter we review estimates of uncollectible amounts and such economic or other conditions or trends in order to enable us to determine whether or not to adjust the amount of the allowance 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments on their accounts or notes  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation reserve 
our collectibles inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sale value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products due to volatility in the price of precious metal  the condition of the collectible and any specific features of the individual collectible 
we review the market values of the collectible on a quarterly basis 
ultimately  we recognize a profit or loss on the actual sale of the collectible relative to its most recent inventory carrying value 
our estimates of market values have proven to be reasonably accurate in the past 
if there were to be an economic downturn or there were to occur other events or circumstances that are likely to make it more difficult to sell  or that would lead us to reduce the sales prices of  those collectibles  it may become necessary to increase the reserve 
increases in this reserve will cause a decline in operating results  because such increases are recorded by charges against income 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins  sportscards  stamps and currency that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if any such collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible or  at our option  pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
however this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded the item 
if we purchase an item under a warranty claim we recognize  as a reduction in our warranty reserve  the difference in value of the item at its original grade and its re graded estimated value 
we include the purchased item in our inventory at the re graded estimated value of the item 
we offer a similar limited warranty of two years duration on the diamonds we grade 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
through september   our warranty reserves had proved to be adequate 
however  certain warranty claims were received by us in the second quarter and early in third quarter of fiscal that were significant in relation to our historical claims experience and  as a result  we recognized  in the second quarter of  an additional expense of  for those claims 
we also decided to increase our warranty accrual rate  effective january   to reflect this higher warranty claims experience  and we will continue to monitor the adequacy of our warranty reserves on an on going basis 
if warranty claims were to increase in relation to historical trends and experience  management would be required to increase the warranty reserves and incur additional charges that would have the effect of reducing income in those periods during which the warranty reserve is increased 
long lived assets other than goodwill 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets other than goodwill  including certain identifiable intangibles  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of a definite lived asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition in order to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
based on such reviews  we determined that impairment losses occurred in fiscal year in the amounts of approximately  for property and equipment   for intangible assets other than goodwill  and  for other assets in relation to our jewelry businesses 
during fiscal year  we recorded impairment losses of  for equipment  and  for intangible assets in relation to our jewelry businesses and  in equipment unrelated to our jewelry businesses 
because the company has incurred significant operating losses in its jewelry reporting units since the acquisitions of these businesses and has recognized impairment losses at june   management intends to closely monitor the performance and future prospects of these units for further impairment 
due to the early stage of the jewelry businesses  significant risk and uncertainty exists around estimating the level and timing of future revenues of these businesses 
such estimates of revenue will significantly impact the expected level of future cash flows from those businesses  which is used in determining whether the fair value of those businesses are less than the carrying amount of the assets of those businesses 
it is possible that the company may need to record additional impairment losses as a result of testing these or other units for impairment during the annual impairment tests or on an interim basis if a triggering event occurs 
goodwill 
we test the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on a formal basis at least annually on their respective acquisition anniversary dates  or more frequently if indicators of impairment are determined to exist 
we apply a discounted cash flow model or an income approach to determining a fair value that is used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit on a total basis  which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  no impairment of goodwill exists as of the measurement date 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then there is the possibility of goodwill impairment and further testing and remeasurement of goodwill is required 
in accordance with gaap  we consider the diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses as separate reporting units for the purpose of testing separately for the impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the occurrence of losses in prior fiscal periods in our jewelry reporting units and the uncertainty of the timing of future revenues and related cash flows  we concluded during the fourth quarter of that such indicators of impairment did exist in our diamond and colored gemstone grading reporting units at june   which resulted in impairment losses related to goodwill recorded on the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended june  in the amounts of approximately  for the diamond grading reporting unit and approximately  for the colored gemstone reporting unit 
because the company has incurred significant operating losses in its jewelry reporting units since the acquisitions of these businesses and has recognized impairment losses at june   management intends to closely monitor the performance and future prospects of these units for further impairment 
due to the early stage of the jewelry businesses  significant risk and uncertainty exists around estimating the level and timing of future revenues of these businesses 
such estimates of revenue will significantly impact the expected level of future cash flows from those businesses  which is used in determining whether the fair value of those businesses are less than the carrying amount of the assets of those businesses 
it is possible that the company may need to record additional impairment losses as a result of testing these or other units for impairment during the annual impairment tests or on an interim basis if a triggering event occurs 
stock based compensation 
we recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  assumptions are made with respect to the expected lives of the options or other stock awards granted  the expected volatility of the company s stock  dividend yield percentage and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  we recognize and report share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate that we expect will occur over the vesting period of the stock awards  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect the likelihood of forfeiture 
due to the smaller number of stock awards granted to fewer employees since the company adopted sfas no 
r  and the cumulative nature of any adjustment arising from a change in the forfeiture rate  we monitor the forfeiture rate very closely  to ensure that all stock awards that vest are fully expensed at the time the vesting occurs 
once we determine the compensation expense of a stock award  that expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over its vesting period using the straight line attribution method 
during fiscal and  we issued restricted shares to outside members of the board of directors and to our ceo and  accordingly  we recognize stock based compensation over the vesting period of such restricted shares  based upon the closing stock prices of the shares on their respective dates of the grant  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
capitalized software 
in fiscal years  and  we capitalized approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs related to a number of in house software development projects  in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires that certain costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software  which be believe is conservatively estimated at three years 
planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase are recognized as expense in the period in which they are incurred 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we recorded approximately   and  respectively  as amortization expense related to such capitalized software projects 
we evaluate the carrying values of capitalized software to determine if the carrying values are impaired  and  if necessary  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which an impairment occurs 
income taxes and deferred tax assets 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
sfas no 
requires the recording of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets or liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires that we evaluate the probability of realizing the future benefits comprising that asset and we review the nature  the expected timing of the realization of these assets and the expiration dates for net operating losses or credits  when determining the likelihood of realization 
the company has gross deferred tax assets of  at june  the deferred tax assets include tax deductions that will arise in future years for the impairment losses recognized at june  also included in the deferred tax assets at june  are  of net operating losses which expire no later than and  of california enterprise zone credits  which can be carried forward indefinitely 
realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
utilization of the net operating losses requires the company to generate sufficient taxable income before their expiration 
the california enterprise zone credits will only be utilized if taxable income is generated in the enterprise zone 
due to the length of time and the extent of the taxable income required to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to the impairment loss and the california enterprise zone credits  the company recorded a valuation allowance of  against such assets at june  the remaining net deferred tax asset of  has been determined by management to be more likely than not realizable at june  based upon projections of future taxable income 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and  in addition  requires us to disclose our policy for the classification of interest and penalties in our statements of operations 
fin requires that we adjust our financial statements to reflect only tax positions which we believe are more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the positions 
fin requires that any necessary adjustment be recorded directly to the beginning balance of retained earnings or accumulated deficit in the period of adoption of fin and reported as a change in accounting principle  if material 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the cumulative effects of applying fin were recorded as an increase of  to accumulated deficit  an increase to income taxes payable of  and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of  interest and penalties totaled  as of july   the date of the adoption of fin  and were accounted for as part of the total adjustment to accumulated deficit of  during fiscal year  which followed the adoption of fin  we recorded approximately  in interest and penalties as components of income tax expense

net revenues consist primarily of fees that we generate from the authentication and grading of high value collectibles  including coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps and currency  and high value assets consisting of diamonds and colored gemstones 
to a lesser extent  we generate collectibles related service revenues referred to as other related revenues from sales of collectibles club memberships and advertising on our websites and in printed publications and collectibles price guides  subscription based revenues primarily related to our cce dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for coins authenticated and graded by us  and fees earned from promoting  managing and operating collectibles conventions 
net revenues also include  to a significantly lesser extent  revenues from the sales of products  consisting primarily of coins that we purchase under our warranty policy 
revenues from product sales are not considered an integral part of our on going revenue generating activities 
in the year ended june   such sales accounted for less than  of our net revenues

fiscal vs 
our net revenues increased by  or  in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year that increase was due primarily to net revenue increases of  or  generated by our other related services  and  generated by product sales  partially offset by a  or  decrease in grading and authentication service fees 
as discussed above  product revenues represent the sale  primarily of coins that are purchased under our warranty policy and  as such  are not considered an integral part of our primary revenue generating activities 
therefore  excluding product revenues  total service revenues increased by in fiscal  compared to the  increase in other related service revenues in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily the result of increased advertising revenues earned on the company s coin and sportscards publications and increased revenues in our cfc financing business 
the decrease of  in grading and authentication fees in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was comprised primarily of a decrease of  or in coin grading and authentications fees  which was substantially  but not fully  offset by a  or  increase in fees generated by our other grading and authentication businesses  other than sportscard grading  the fees from which were essentially unchanged in from the decrease in coin grading revenues in was primarily attributable to a  decrease in coin trade show revenues  as a result of i our attending two fewer collectibles trade shows in fiscal than in fiscal  and ii a decrease in grading submissions at the trade shows we attended in the second half of we believe the high price of gold and the adverse effect this increase had on the volume of gold coins submissions at trade shows in the second half of the year was due to limited capital and borrowing capacity in the market to absorb the higher price of gold coins and dealers avoiding the relatively higher cost of submissions at trade shows as compared with our other services 
on the other hand  vintage coins grading revenues  on which we usually generate higher revenues due primarily to faster turn around times requested by submitters  increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  however  that increase was largely offset by a decrease in modern coin grading revenues in fiscal fiscal vs 
revenues increased by  or to  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year this increase was attributable primarily to i an increase of approximately  or  in net revenues generated primarily by the other non grading related services  attributable primarily to businesses we acquired in the fiscal year and first three months of fiscal  and ii an increase of approximately  or  in grading and authentication revenues 
the increase in grading and authentication revenues was largely attributable to increases in the volume of submissions of sportscards  other collectibles and diamonds and colored gemstones  which more than offset a decline in coin authentication and grading revenues 
approximately  of the increase in our fiscal revenues was generated by the collectibles convention business and our colored gemstone grading business  agl  both of which we acquired in the first three months of fiscal excluding the contribution made by those two businesses  revenues grew by in as compared to fiscal the increase in revenues generated by our other non grading related service businesses in  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to i increased sales of collectors club memberships and cce subscriptions  ii an increase in interest earned as a result of an increase in the average amount of loans outstanding to dealers under our dealer finance program  and iii revenues generated by our collectibles convention business that we acquired at the beginning of fiscal the increase in grading and authentication revenues was driven by a increase in the average service price per unit for our grading and authentication businesses  compared to the prior fiscal year  offset by a decrease in total units graded 
coin grading revenues decreased by and the number of units graded decreased by  primarily driven by i a  decrease in show and invitational revenues ii a net  decrease in revenue attributable to a decrease in first strike bulk units graded  partially offset by an increase in the average service fees earned on those units  and iii a  increase in revenue due to an increase in the volume of vintage collectibles submissions 
we believe the reduction in the first strike submissions was due to a number of factors  including a dispute related to pcgs trademarked first strike designation  which was subsequently resolved 
for sportscards  the increase in the number of units graded was partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue  resulting in a increase in net revenues 
a increase in units graded and authenticated for other collectibles and diamonds and colored gemstones resulted in a increase in the grading and authentication revenues generated by those businesses in  as compared to  primarily driven by increases in the volume of diamond and stamp grading submissions  as well as the contribution to our revenues of our colored gemstone authentication and grading business  which we acquired in august of gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
the costs of authentication and grading revenues consist primarily of labor to authenticate and grade collectibles  production costs  credit card fees  warranty expense  occupancy  security  depreciation  amortization and insurance costs that directly relate to providing authentication and grading services 
cost of revenues also includes printing  other direct costs of the revenues generated by our other non grading services and the costs of product revenues  which represent the carrying value of the inventory of products primarily collectible coins that we sold 
in addition  costs of revenues include stock based compensation attributable to employees whose compensation is classified as part of the costs of authentication and grading revenues

as indicated in the above table  our total gross profit margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding gross profit on revenues generated by product sales  which are not an integral part of our core revenue generating activities  the gross profit margin for grading and authentication and other related services in was  compared with for in the case of our coin business  that decline reflects i the decrease in the number of coins graded in  compared to  and a change in the mix of coin services rendered to a higher proportion of lower margin submissions which resulted in a small reduction in the average service fee earned on coins in fiscal  ii the  increase in warranty costs recognized in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the increase in the dollar amount of warranty claims described above  and iii an increase in personnel  travel  printing  and on going warranty costs in support of our coin grading activities 
the decline in gross profit margins in our diamond business were primarily attributable to higher salaries and fixed costs due to our occupancy of a larger facility to provide increased grading capacity 
the decline in gross profit margins in our colored gemstone grading business  which we acquired in august   was primarily due to the addition of personnel to increase our grading capacity  as we focused attention on growing our colored gemstone grading business and launching additional colored gemstone grading services 
vs 
the decline in our gross profit margin to in the fiscal year ended june   from in fiscal  was attributable to a number of different factors  including the following i a decline in the gross margin on coin authentication and grading  due primarily to an increase in costs resulting from the addition of new coin grading capacity in anticipation of increased volumes of submissions and to reduce the turnaround times within which coins are authenticated and graded  ii a decline in the gross margin realized on sportscard authentication and grading services  due primarily to a decrease in sportscard related advertising revenues and higher production costs incurred due to a change in the mix of sportscard units graded in as compared to  iii a change in the mix of our authentication and grading revenues to a lower proportion of coin authentication and grading revenues  on which we have historically realized higher margins than on the authentication and grading of other collectibles  as coin revenues represented approximately of total net revenues in the fiscal  compared to approximately of total net revenues in fiscal  and iv the early stage of our diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses as we increased our diamond grading capacity in anticipation of increased revenues in future periods 
the decline was partially offset by a  decrease in the stock based compensation costs classified as cost of revenues in fiscal  from  in fiscal selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of advertising and promotions costs  trade show related expenses  customer service personnel costs  depreciation and third party consulting costs 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues fiscal vs 
the  increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to i an increase of  in such expenses related to business development activities primarily by our collectibles grading and subscription divisions  which included increased participation at trade shows by other non coin grading divisions  and ii an increase of  in sales and marketing expense to foster brand awareness and to attract increased submissions for our diamond and colored gemstone businesses 
increases in sales and marketing expenses for our diamond and colored gemstone businesses were incurred in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year which coincide with the traditional holiday buying season in those markets 
in the second half of our fiscal year  sales and marketing costs for our diamond and colored gemstone businesses decreased by approximately  compared to the same six month period of the prior year  as we transition from our branding and awareness marketing campaigns to a more units driven marketing approach 
vs 
the increases in selling and marketing expenses of  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  in fiscal  compared to the prior fiscal year  were primarily attributable to i an increase of approximately  in sales and marketing costs to market and promote our new businesses  including our diamond grading business which we acquired in november  our colored gemstone grading business which we acquired in august  and our cce subscription business which we acquired in september  ii a  increase in sales and marketing costs primarily to promote our coin and sportscard authentication and grading services at trade shows including an increase in the number of trade shows attended and in other channels  and iii increases in general marketing costs  including an increase in marketing related compensation costs attributable to the hiring  in november  of a chief marketing officer for our diamond and colored gemstone businesses

in addition  we incurred a  increase in g a related stock based compensation costs in  as compared to  due primarily to restricted stock awards granted to our ceo and our outside non management directors in and we also invested in additional accounting and information technology personnel of approximately  to support the company s expanded businesses 
these increased costs were offset by savings in legal  professional and outside services costs compared to fiscal vs 
the increase in g a expenses of  in fiscal  compared to prior fiscal year  was primarily attributable to i expenses  totaling approximately  incurred in connection with initiatives to grow our then recently acquired diamond  colored gemstone  and trade show businesses  ii increased costs of approximately  to upgrade and expand our internal systems to support an increased volume of business and our entry into new markets  and iii increased business development costs of approximately  incurred in connection with our coin authentication and grading business 
such cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in litigation related costs in fiscal  compared to the same periods of fiscal  during which we incurred legal fees and expenses in connection with the miller trial 
stock based compensation costs including  of amortization expense related to restricted stock awards included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal impairment losses fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands impairment losses as a percentage of net revenues the increase in impairment losses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  equipment and other assets in our diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses 
during fiscal  approximately    and  were recorded as impairment losses for goodwill  other intangible assets  equipment and other assets  respectively 
in fiscal year  we recorded impairment losses of  for equipment and  for intangible assets in relation to our jewelry businesses and  unrelated to our jewelry businesses 
the fiscal impairments were the result of past losses and the uncertainty of the timing and magnitude of future revenues and related cash flows that are used in the determination of fair value 
under circumstances in which the fair values of long lived assets and goodwill are not recoverable on the basis of future cash flows  we record impairment losses such that the carrying values of these assets reflect their current estimate of fair values 
amortization of intangible assets fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues the increase in the amortization expense of  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  related to the amortization of capitalized software costs for which amortization commences as development projects are completed 
in addition  we also incur amortization costs in connection with the intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions that occurred during fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal capitalized software costs and acquired intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
stock based compensation we recognized stock based compensation which includes compensations costs related to the issuance of restricted stock and stock option grants of   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
stock based compensation is recorded as part of i costs of sales  in the case of stock awards granted to employees whose costs are classified as cost of revenues  ii selling and marketing expenses in the case of stock awards granted to marketing and sales personnel and iii general and administrative expenses in the case of stock awards granted to directors  executive and financial management and administrative personnel  as follows fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands cost of revenues selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses we issue stock options or restricted stock awards to employees and outside directors with respect to which the only condition for vesting is continued employment or service during the related vesting period 
typically  the vesting period is four years for employee awards and shorter periods for director awards  reflecting their service periods  although we have  on occasion  granted stock options with immediate vesting 
during fiscal and fiscal  we issued a total of approximately  shares of restricted stock to our ceo  cfo management and the non management directors  which required us to recognize stock based compensation expense of approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
no shares of restricted stock were issued in fiscal and no stock based compensation related to restricted shares was recognized in the shares of restricted stock issued to management and our outside directors have vesting periods of four years and one year  respectively

we calculate stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock options as of their respective grant dates using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and recognize such costs on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
for fiscal years  and  stock based compensation consisted of compensation costs attributable to options granted in prior years that were outstanding but were not fully vested as of july   the adoption date of sfas no

interest income  net interest income is generated on cash balances that we have invested  primarily in highly liquid money market accounts and funds  short term bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper instruments and tax free funds 
such interest income does not include the interest that we generate on loans we make pursuant to our dealer finance program  which are included in net revenues 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands interest income  net percent of net revenue fiscal vs 
interest income  net was  in  compared with  in the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to i a shift of our cash and cash equivalent balances for part of the year into liquid tax free money funds from taxable investments  ii a decrease in our average cash balances in  compared to  due to our use of cash to fund increased payments of quarterly dividends  capital expenditures  the repurchases of shares of our common stock under our share buyback program  increases in advances under our dealer financing program and cash used to fund operating losses  and iii a decrease in interest rates earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances during  compared with  due to reductions in prevailing market rates of interest as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve board 
vs 
the reduction in interest income  net to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  was primarily due to decreases in our average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances during fiscal  reflecting our use of cash to fund i business acquisitions in fiscal year  ii capital expenditures  primarily for purchase of fixed assets  iii the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders  and iv repurchases of our common stock under our stock buyback program  which more than offset cash generated from operations and the effect on interest income of increases in prevailing interest rates in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal provision benefit for income taxes fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands provision benefit for income taxes percent of net revenue the income tax benefit recorded in fiscal reflects an effective tax benefit rate of due to a pre tax loss in fiscal and permanent differences between the company s income for book purposes and for tax purposes  reflecting the non deductibility of stock based compensation costs related to incentive stock options and the recognition of a valuation allowance in fiscal for deferred tax assets on the basis that it would be more likely than not that these assets would not be recoverable by estimates of future taxable income 
due to the length of time and the extent of the taxable income required to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to the impairment loss and the california enterprise zone credits  the company recorded a valuation allowance against such assets at june  in the amount of approximately  for fiscal  the effective tax benefit was approximately and reflected the higher percentage of permanent differences between income for book and income for tax purposes due to the level of losses in for fiscal  our effective tax rate was reflecting such permanent differences  which had the effect of increasing the effective tax rate in  as the company earned income in that year 
discontinued operations fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands income loss from discontinued operations  net of gains on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes the income loss from discontinued operations relates to the disposal of the collectible sales businesses and includes i the losses or gains recognized on the sales of those businesses and the disposition of the assets of those businesses that we retained consisting primarily of inventories and accounts receivables  ii for fiscal the results of ctp from september  to november  the date of its disposition  and iii the gain on disposal of the discontinued businesses related to additional consideration on the sales of those businesses that became determinable in fiscal and as the terms of the sales of some of those businesses provided for the payment to us of future consideration based on the performance of those businesses for periods subsequent to their sales 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these quarterly operating results  which reflect the reclassification of our results of operations between continuing operations and discontinued operations as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent periods 
generally  the revenues generated by our collectibles grading and authentication businesses are lower during our second quarter  which ends on december  than in other quarterly periods 
on the other hand  our diamond and colored gemstone grading businesses which we acquired in november and august  respectively  generate higher revenues in our second quarter  which coincides with the winter holiday season  than in other quarterly periods 
our expectation is that  over time  our diamond and colored gemstone revenues will represent a higher proportion of total revenues and will reduce the effect of seasonality in the second fiscal quarter 
our collectibles convention business  which we acquired in july  adds to the variability in our quarter to quarter operating results  as its revenues vary based on the timing of the collectibles conventions it holds 
revenues for this business unit are significantly higher in the first  third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  compared to the second quarter  because the long beach show the larger of the two shows takes place during the first  third and fourth quarters  while the santa clara convention takes place in the second and fourth quarters

historically  we have relied on internally generated funds  rather than borrowings  as our primary source of funds to support our operations 
although we used cash to fund operations in fiscal  due to operating losses incurred  we continue to expect our authentication and grading services and our subscription services to provide us with positive operating cash flows  as our early stage businesses grow and reduce their operating losses 
during fiscal  operating activities of our continuing operations used net cash of  compared with  generated in fiscal due primarily to operating losses incurred in fiscal investing activities used net cash of  during fiscal  comprised of i  and  to purchase fixed assets and invest in capitalized software  respectively  and ii  in net advances under our financing program

bank line of credit 
as previously reported  in fiscal  we organized collectors finance corporation cfc  as a wholly owned subsidiary  to engage in the business of making loans primarily to coin or sportscards dealers 
all such loans were required to be collateralized by the delivery to us of collectibles with a fair market value at least equal to the amount of the loans 
the loans were required to be repaid to us when those collectibles are returned to the dealers 
to provide a source of funding for those loans  in june  cfc obtained a revolving bank line of credit for the original term of two years pursuant to a loan and security agreement that permitted cfc to borrow  at any one time  up to the lesser of i  or ii an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of those of its loan receivables that met the bank s eligibility criteria 
borrowings under that credit line  the term of which was extended to july   were to bear interest at rates based on the bank s prime rate or libor  as applicable  and were secured by the loans receivable due cfc 
there were no borrowings outstanding under that line of credit during the fiscal years ended or at june  or this line of credit expired in july  coinciding with a decision by the company to cease making new loans under our financing program 
in august  the company sold approximately  principal amount of its dealer loans  which were secured by collectible coins  to an unaffiliated purchaser for a purchase price of approximately  in cash 
outstanding financial obligations 
we had the following outstanding obligations under operating leases  net of sublease income at june   for years ending june thereafter with the exception of these obligations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt  capital lease  or long term purchase obligations 
stock buyback program 
in december  our board of directors approved a stock buyback program that authorizes up to  of stock repurchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities exchange commission rules  when opportunities to make such repurchases  at attractive prices  become available 
we are under no obligation to repurchase any shares under the stock buyback program and the timing  actual number and dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under that program will depend on a number of factors  including our future financial performance  available cash resources and competing uses for the cash that may arise in the future  prevailing market prices of the company s common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that the company believes are attractive 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we repurchased a total of   and  shares  respectively  of our common stock under this program for aggregate purchase prices of approximately   and  respectively excluding transaction costs 
additional information regarding these share repurchases is set forth in item of this report 
at june   the total dollar value of shares that could be purchased in the future under this program was  dividends 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the board of directors adopted a dividend policy that called for the payment of quarterly cash dividends of per common share  for an expected annual cash dividend of per common share 
the quarterly cash dividend was increased to per share  in the third quarter of fiscal in june  the board of directors approved another increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per common share for an expected annual cash dividend to stockholders of per common share  and dividends were paid under this policy throughout fiscal for a total dividend paid in fiscal of  as we disclosed previously  the continued payment of cash dividends was subject to a number of factors  including the company s financial performance and changes in market and financial conditions  therefore  there could be no assurance that the amount of the cash dividend would not be reduced or the payment of cash dividends would not be suspended or discontinued by the board of directors 
on september   the board of directors determined that  due to market and economic conditions  including the liquidity crisis in the united states  the prudent course of action would be  and the board of directors voted  to suspend the future payment of cash dividends in order to preserve the company s cash resources to support the continued implementation of the company s strategic plan and the growth of its business 
at the same time  the board of directors approved a stock dividend on the company s outstanding shares  and it declared this stock dividend will be distributed on november  to all stockholders of record on october  uses and sources of cash 
we plan to use our cash resources  including the cash we generated in august from the sale of customer loans  to i introduce new services for our customers  ii acquire or start up other high value collectibles or high value asset authentication and grading businesses  iii make private and open market share repurchases under our stock buyback program if there are opportunities to do so at prices that we believe are attractive  and iv fund working capital requirements  and for other corporate purposes 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings  and we may issue additional shares of our stock  to finance acquisitions of additional authentication and grading businesses 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all
