item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
some of the information in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this form k  including our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
please review the forward looking statements and the risk factors sections of this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those anticipated or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for endocrine disorders such as diabetes and osteoporosis  which may be safer  more effective and convenient 
we develop our product candidates by applying our proprietary formulation technologies to existing drugs in order to improve their therapeutic results 
our initial development efforts are focused on peptide hormones 
our most advanced product candidate  viaject tm  has been studied in two pivotal phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of patients with type and type diabetes 
earlier stage product candidates include viatab tm  a sublingual tablet formulation of insulin and two preclinical product candidates for the treatment of osteoporosis 
viaject tm is our proprietary injectable formulation of recombinant human insulin designed to be absorbed into the blood faster than the currently marketed rapid acting insulin analogs 
we have recently completed two pivotal phase iii clinical trials of viaject tm  one in patients with type diabetes and the other in patients with type diabetes 
in both clinical trials we compared viaject tm to humulin r  a form of recombinant human insulin 
we believe viaject tm can improve the management of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes by more closely mimicking the natural first phase insulin release that healthy individuals experience at mealtime 
in september  we announced results from a preliminary analysis of the data from our pivotal phase iii clinical trials of viaject tm 
in our type trial we found that viaject tm was comparable to humulin r in terms of blood glucose control  when measured by the mean change in patients hbac levels 
additionally  we reported that type patients receiving viaject tm  when compared to those receiving humulin r  experienced fewer mild and moderate  or non severe  hypoglycemic events and gained weight at lower rate 
in our type trial  we found that viaject tm was comparable to humulin r in terms of blood glucose control among patients in the united states and germany 
however  when hbac data from patients in india were included in the analysis  change in hbac favored the humulin r treatment group 
data from india was shown to be statistically different treatment by country interaction  p which  in our view  made these data not comparable to the data collected in the united states and germany 
we also reported that type patients receiving viaject tm  when compared to those receiving humulin r  experienced fewer severe hypoglycemic events and lost weight instead of gaining weight 
the finding regarding weight was progressive  with patients receiving viaject tm continuing to lose weight and patients receiving humulin r continuing to gain weight over the course of treatment 
accordingly  we believe viaject tm may be a safer form of mealtime insulin therapy than is currently available to patients with type or type diabetes 
we expect to meet with officials from the division of metabolic and endocrine drug products of the us food and drug administration  or the fda  by the end of january to discuss the submission of a new drug application  or nda  for viaject tm based on the results of our two pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
we are conducting ongoing analyses of all data from both trials that we expect to complete prior to meeting with the fda 
after meeting with the fda  we plan to conduct at least one new clinical trial of viaject tm in patients with type diabetes 
the determination of whether to submit the nda prior to or after the new trial will depend on the results of ongoing analyses  expert consultation and regulatory feedback 
if we submit the nda after the completion of the additional trial  our submission would likely be filed no earlier than the 
table of contents second calendar quarter of if we do not  we intend to submit the nda by the end of the second calendar quarter of we have developed all of our product candidates utilizing our proprietary viadel tm technology  which allows us to study the interaction between peptide hormones and small molecules 
we use our technology to reformulate existing peptide drugs with small molecule ingredients that are generally regarded as safe by the fda to improve their therapeutic effect by entering the blood more rapidly and in greater quantities 
we are a development stage company 
we were incorporated in december and commenced active operations in january to date  we have generated no revenues and have incurred significant losses 
we have financed our operations and internal growth through our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february and prior to that  private placements of convertible preferred stock and other securities 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  as of september   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
the deficit accumulated during the development stage is attributable primarily to our research and development activities and non cash charges for accretion of beneficial conversion rights and deemed dividend warrants and stock based compensation 
research and development and general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net loss applicable to common stockholders  represent approximately and  respectively  of the expenses that we have incurred since our inception 
we expect to continue to generate significant losses as we continue to develop our product candidates 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds from this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  of million 
certain of our stockholders sold  shares in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares from the selling stockholders 
in november  a holder of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share exercised such warrants on a cash exercise basis 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received million in connection with such exercise in january in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock primarily with institutional investors at a price to the public of per share  with net proceeds totaling approximately million 
the completion of the initial public offering resulted in the conversion of our series a and b convertible preferred stock 
a total of  shares of common stock were issued upon the conversion of the preferred stock 
in april  we effected a for one reverse stock split 
all references in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial statements and comments on the units of common stock or per share amounts are reflective of the reverse split for all periods reported 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have generated no revenues 
we do not expect to begin generating any revenues unless any of our product candidates receive marketing approval or if we receive payments in connection with strategic collaborations that we may enter into for the commercialization of our product candidates 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of the cost associated with our basic research activities  as well as the costs associated with our drug development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical 
table of contents trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
our research and development expenses consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  third party manufacturing organizations and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits for the personnel involved in our preclinical and clinical drug development and manufacturing activities  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
while we have suspended significant expenditures on viatab tm  viamass tm  viacal tm and any enlargement of our laboratory facilities pending further development of our regulatory plans for viaject tm  we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years 
we do not anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase significantly over the next twelve months as we focus our product development efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject tm 
nor do we anticipate that our expenses will decrease materially  if at all  as we continue our clinical trial extension program for the pivotal phase iii clinical trials of viaject tm  which is designed to run through the eighteenth month of patient treatment  subject to compassionate use exceptions  if any  conduct additional clinical trials of viaject tm to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval  and purchase recombinant human insulin and other materials to build commercial supply inventory for viaject tm 
if we obtain regulatory approval for viaject tm  research and development expenses may increase significantly as we prepare for the commercial launch of viaject tm and restart development work on our early stage product candidates 
we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
to date  we have not tracked expenses related to our product development activities on a program by program basis 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of research and development expenses that we incurred with respect to each of our clinical and preclinical product candidates 
however  substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date are attributable to our viaject tm program 
the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by nature of the cost 
december  inception to year ended september  september  in thousands research and development expenses pre clinical expenses manufacturing expenses clinical regulatory expenses total the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
while we have suspended significant expenditures on our earlier stage product candidates pending further development of our regulatory plans for viaject tm  we do not expect our research and development expenses to decrease materially  if at all  particularly as we continue our phase iii clinical trial extension program for viaject tm  conduct new clinical trials of viaject tm produce both registration and validation batches  and purchase recombinant human insulin 

table of contents at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or the ffdca  the costs associated with preparing and submitting an nda for our lead product candidate  viaject tm  our ability to secure approval by the fda viaject tm without conducting additional pivotal clinical trials  the size  endpoints and duration of additional clinical trials of viaject tm in patients with type diabetes to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval  the cost to fully develop the iu cc liquid formulation of viaject tm  the costs of pre commercialization activities  including increased insulin purchases  the costs associated with qualifying and obtaining regulatory approval of suppliers of insulin and manufacturers of our product candidates  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  the effect on our product development activities of actions taken by the fda or other regulatory authorities  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of viaject tm prior to our filing an nda for viaject tm or our other product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with product development 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct an additional pivotal phase iii clinical trial of viaject tm  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of that clinical development program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  in our executive  legal  accounting  finance and information technology functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense  travel expenses  costs associated with industry conventions and professional fees  such as legal and accounting fees and consulting costs 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will not increase significantly as we focus our product development efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject tm 
if we materially alter our development plans for viaject tm after meeting with the fda  we may incur unanticipated general and administrative expenses for the following reasons  among others we may choose to recommence research and development activities relating to our earlier stage product candidates  we may incur additional expenses as we advance discussions and negotiations in connection with strategic collaborations for commercialization of our product candidates  and we may also begin to incur expenses related to the sales and marketing of our product candidates as we approach the commercial launch of any product candidates that receive regulatory approval 

table of contents interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  resulting primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february in november  our board of directors approved investment policy guidelines  the primary objectives of which are the preservation of capital  the maintenance of liquidity and maintenance of appropriate fiduciary control subject to our business objectives and tax situation 
exercise of warrants in march  we offered the holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock and an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share the opportunity to exercise such warrants at an exercise price of  representing a discount in the exercise price 
such holders exercised all of such warrants on a combination of cashless and cash exercise basis 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately million in connection with such exercises 
as a result of the discounted exercise price  in the fiscal quarter ended march   we recorded a deemed dividend charge of approximately million for the warrants that were so exercised 
as of september   we had warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this form k  we believe that the following accounting policies  which we have discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals in preparing our financial statements  we must estimate accrued expenses pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct and manage preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacture product for these trials on our behalf 
this process involves communicating with relevant personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for services when we have not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
the financial terms of these agreements vary and may result in uneven payment flows 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  
table of contents fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
stock based compensation effective october   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the retrospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is measured and recognized for all share based payments granted subsequent to october  we issued no options prior to that date 
the fair value of the stock underlying the options is a significant factor in determining credits or charges to operations appropriate for the stock based payments to both employees and non employees 
between december  and may   we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
between november  and november   we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
between december and september  we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
between october and september  we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we selected the black scholes valuation model as the most appropriate valuation method for stock option grants to employees  members of our board of directors and non employees 
the fair value of these stock option grants is estimated as of their date of grant using the black scholes valuation method 
our compensation committee adopted the valuations of an independent third party appraiser in determining the fair market value of our common stock for the black scholes model 
because we lack company specific historical and implied volatility information  we based our estimate of expected volatility on the median historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that we believe are comparable to us based on the criteria set forth in sfas no 
r  particularly line of business  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
we will continue to consistently apply this process using the same comparable companies until sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available 
however  we will regularly review these comparable companies  and may substitute more appropriate companies if facts and circumstances warrant a change 
we use the average of the weighted average vesting period and the contractual life of the option  eight years  as the estimated term of the option 
the risk free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the yield of a us treasury strip on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award 
we estimate forfeitures based on actual forfeitures during our limited history 
additionally  we have assumed that dividends will not be paid 
for options granted to non employees and non directors  primarily consultants serving on our scientific advisory board  we measure fair value of the equity instruments utilizing the black scholes method  if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or service received 
the fair value of these equity investments are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related period of service or the vesting period  whichever is longer 
as of september   we issued to these non employees options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
because we must revalue these options for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the stock based compensation expense related to these non employee options will increase or decrease  based on changes in the price of our common stock 
for the years ended september   and  the stock based compensation expense related to these options was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended september   the stock based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the stock based compensation expense related to these options was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of september   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  connecticut state net operating loss carryforwards of million and federal and local research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately million  all of which expire starting in the internal revenue code contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss and credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year as a result of certain historical changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders 
as a result of the cumulative impact of our equity issuances over the past two years  a change of ownership  as defined in the internal revenue code occurred upon our issuance of series b convertible preferred stock in july as a result  our total net operating losses will be subject to an annual base limitation 
at september   we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million  as our management believes it is uncertain that it will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 
results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development costs related to our recently completed pivotal phase iii clinical trials for viaject tm 
specific increases in research and development expenses included million related to increased clinical trial expenses in  million related to increased manufacturing expenses in for the process development  scale up and manufacture of commercial batches of viaject tm to support our clinical trials and regulatory submissions  and million related to increased personnel costs  non cash stock based compensation expenses and consulting fees 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to non employees 
while we have suspended significant expenditures on viatab tm  viamass tm  viacal tm and any enlargement of our laboratory facilities pending further development of our regulatory plans for viaject tm  we do not anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease materially  if at all  as we continue our phase iii clinical trial extension program for viaject tm  conduct new clinical trials of viaject tm  produce both registration and validation batches  and purchase recombinant human insulin

year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel expense 
the balance of the increase was attributable to increases in insurance expenses  depreciation expenses and higher legal and consulting fees associated with becoming a public company 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the stock based compensation expense for the year ended september  was  we do not expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly over the next twelve months as we focus our product development efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject tm 
over the longer term  however  we anticipate these expenses will increase as we approach the commercial launch of viaject tm 
interest and other income 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents in  resulting primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
deemed dividend warrants 
on march   we offered the holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock and an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share the opportunity to exercise such warrants at an exercise price of  representing a discount in the exercise price 
such holders exercised all such warrants on a combination of cashless and cash exercise basis 
we issued  shares of common stock and received aggregate cash proceeds of million in connection with such exercises 
as a result of the discounted exercise price  we recorded a non cash deemed dividend of approximately million for the warrants that were exercised in the year ended september  no equivalent charge to stockholders was incurred in the year ended september  net loss applicable to common stockholders and net loss per share 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss per share 
table of contents net loss applicable to common stockholders was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the increased expenses described above 
while we have suspended significant expenditures of our earlier stage product candidates in order to focus our product developments efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject tm  we expect our losses to increase in the future as we initiate additional clinical trials of viaject tm to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval

table of contents interest and other income 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents in  resulting primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may interest expense 
interest expense of approximately  for the year ended september  consisted of interest incurred on the promissory notes issued in our mezzanine financing 
in july  all of the promissory notes were repaid using shares of our series b convertible preferred stock and warrants in connection with our series b convertible preferred stock financing 
for the year ended september   we had no interest expense 
loss on settlement of debt 
in july  we completed our series b convertible preferred stock financing 
in connection with that transaction  we exercised our option to repay the promissory notes that we had issued in our mezzanine financing with shares of series b convertible preferred stock and warrants 
due to the contractual terms of our mezzanine financing  these investors effectively received a premium on the principal amount of the promissory notes that were a part of the mezzanine financing units 
as a result of this premium  we recorded a loss on settlement of debt of million 
no equivalent charge to stockholders was incurred in the year ended september  charge for accretion of beneficial conversion rights 
we recorded a beneficial conversion charge related to the issuance of our series b convertible preferred stock and the conversion option embedded therein 
in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  we accreted the charge immediately and have shown a million charge for accretion of beneficial conversion rights in the year ended september  no equivalent expense was incurred in the year ended september  deemed dividend warrants

such holders exercised all such warrants on a combination of cashless and cash exercise basis 
we issued  shares of common stock and received aggregate cash proceeds of million in connection with such exercises

net loss applicable to common stockholders was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the increased expenses described above and the non cash deemed dividend charge of million related to the discounted exercise price of our warrants 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and cash flows as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products or other sources of revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated significant operating losses since we were incorporated in we have funded our research and development operations primarily through proceeds from our series a convertible preferred stock financing in and our mezzanine and series b convertible preferred stock financings in through december   we had received aggregate gross proceeds of million from these sales 
we received an aggregate of million from our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
to date  we have invested our excess funds primarily in managed money funds with two major financial institutions 
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are categorized as cash equivalents 
we plan to continue to invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our approved investment policy guidelines  which set forth our policy to hold investment securities to maturity 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended september  primarily reflects the net loss for the period  offset in part by stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization expenses and increases in accrued expenses  an income tax receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in operations for the years ended september  and primarily reflects the net loss for the period  offset in part by depreciation  share base compensation and loss on settlement of debt and changes in accrued expenses  accounts payable and deferred compensation 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  primarily reflects purchases of marketable securities  property and equipment and leasehold improvement costs for our new corporate headquarters

net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from our initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from our mezzanine and series b convertible preferred stock financings 
in july  we entered into a supply agreement with nv organon for a term ending with the fourth calendar quarter of to purchase specified minimum quantities of recombinant human insulin 
we anticipate that our minimum purchase requirements for the next nine consecutive quarters will total at least million  but may be as much as million depending on our regulatory plans for viaject tm 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds from this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  of million 
certain of our stockholders sold  shares in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares from the selling stockholders 
on may   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds of million 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and 
table of contents commissions and additional offering expenses 
the remaining net proceeds were invested in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  in accordance with our investment policy 
funding requirements we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the end of fiscal year we have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
for example  if the fda were to require us to conduct an additional pivotal phase iii clinical trial of viaject tm that is more extensive than any we currently contemplate  our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to complete that clinical development program 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the ffdca  the costs associated with preparing and submitting an nda for viaject tm  our ability to secure approval by the fda for our lead product candidate  viaject tm  without conducting additional pivotal clinical trials  the size  endpoints and duration of additional clinical trials of viaject tm in patients with type diabetes to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval  the cost to fully develop the iu cc liquid formulation of viaject tm  the costs of pre commercialization activities  including increased insulin purchases  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for product candidates developed using our viadel tm technology  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  the effect on our product development activities of actions taken by the fda or other regulatory authorities  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators 
we do not anticipate generating product revenue for the next few years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize 
table of contents independently or enter into corporate collaborations at a later stage of development
