item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview products 
we design  manufacture and market da vinci surgical systems  which are advanced surgical systems that we believe represent a new generation of surgery 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart and a high performance vision system 
the product line also includes proprietary wristed instruments and surgical accessories 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d hd visualization  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery  or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to improve clinical outcomes while reducing the invasiveness of complex surgical

index to financial statements procedures 
the da vinci surgical system is sold into multiple surgical specialties  principally urology  gynecology  cardiothoracic  and general surgery 
business model 
in our business model  we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  comprised of instrument  accessory  and service revenue 
the da vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately million to million  depending on configuration  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
we then generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our endowrist instruments and accessory products for use in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system 
endowrist instruments and accessories will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery and will need to be replaced as they are consumed 
we generate additional recurring revenue from ongoing system service 
we typically enter into service contracts at the time the system is sold 
these service contracts have been generally renewable at the end of the service period  typically at an annual rate of approximately  to  per year  depending on configuration of the underlying system 
since the introduction of the da vinci surgical system in  our established base of da vinci surgical systems has grown and robotic surgery volume has increased 
recurring revenue has grown at an equal or faster rate than system revenue 
over the past five years  revenue generated from the sales of instruments and accessories  service and training increased from million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in to million  or of total revenue  in we expect recurring revenue to become a larger percentage of total revenue in the future 
regulatory activities we believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states 
as we make additions to target procedures  we will continue to obtain the necessary clearance 
the following table lists chronologically our fda clearances to date july general laparoscopic procedures march non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures may prostatectomy procedures november cardiotomy procedures july cardiac revascularization procedures march urologic surgical procedures april gynecologic surgical procedures june pediatric surgical procedures in an october enforcement report from fda  the fda reported on two corrections and removals conducted by us for our systems 
we have addressed these issues through field inspections and corrections using our field service organization 
as part of our quality system  we take a pro active approach in upgrading software in our field systems routinely and in monitoring system performance 
these actions are reviewed by fda and are periodically reported if they meet certain criteria for public reporting 
we believe our quality systems are functioning properly and we continue to work with fda and agencies worldwide to satisfy their reporting requirements 
business events and trends introduction 
we experienced rapid growth during the years ended december  and  which was driven by the continued adoption of the da vinci surgical system for use in urologic  gynecologic  cardiothoracic  and general surgeries

operating income increased by to million  or of revenue  during the year ended december  compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  operating income included million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense for the estimated fair value of employee stock options and stock purchases 
our business continues to demonstrate the ability to generate significant positive cash flow while supporting our rapid business growth 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments increased by million during  including million of proceeds from employee stock programs and warrant exercises 
we ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
procedure adoption we believe the adoption of da vinci surgery occurs surgical procedure by surgical procedure  and it is being adopted for those procedures which offer significant patient value 
the value of a surgical procedure to a patient is higher if it offers superior clinical outcomes  less surgical trauma  or both 
the procedures that have driven the most growth in our business recently are the da vinci prostatectomy dvp and the da vinci hysterectomy dvh 
dvp procedures grew by over in and represented more than half of all the da vinci surgical procedures for the year 
the dvh procedure was a faster growing procedure from a percentage growth standpoint in  growing by over 
new products 
we launched the high definition hd vision system in january in the united states and in may to international markets 
the hd vision system provides more viewing area and enhances visualization of tissue planes and critical anatomy compared with our standard vision system 
the digital zoom feature in the d hd vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting the endoscope position and reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments 
we believe the new d hd vision system enables improved surgical outcomes 
the d hd vision is available as an option on new da vinci s surgical systems and as an upgrade option to our existing customers who own a da vinci s surgical system 
during  of the total da vinci surgical systems sold were hd systems 
we expect a majority of the systems sold in the future to be da vinci s systems with hd vision system  but we do not expect d hd upgrades to comprise a significant portion of revenue in the future 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we launched the arm da vinci s surgical system 
the arm da vinci s surgical system shares the same core functionality of the da vinci s surgical system including a streamlined interface  a motorized patient cart  quick click cannula mounts and single use sterile adapters for

the arm da vinci s surgical system includes a standard definition d vision system and a patient side cart with two instrument arms 
the arm da vinci s surgical system is an addition to the da vinci s product line and can be upgraded in the future to the full capability of a arm da vinci s system with hd vision 
we sold six arm da vinci s surgical systems during the year ended december  during the third quarter of fiscal  we introduced the endowrist large hem o lok clip applier  a new mm endowrist clip applier  that provides the surgeon direct control in placing large hem o lok polymer clips 
the endowrist large hem o lok clip applier was developed in collaboration with teleflex medical  a division of teleflex corporation 
facilities and information technology infrastructure 
we have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth 
in the year  we entered into an agreement to purchase a building and land  approximately acres  adjacent to our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
the existing building will be demolished and we plan to construct a multi use facility with  square feet of floor space 
we do not anticipate completing construction until late in addition  we have entered into a three year lease for approximately  square feet of space in mexicali  mexico 
we intend to manufacture certain products in this space by the end of fiscal we have also invested in information technology infrastructure to support our growth 
total capital expenditures for were million 
technology acquisitions in  we entered into several intellectual property co development arrangements with corporate partners for development in the fiber optic shape sensing area and acquired rights to patents in the flexible robotics area 
in december  we reached agreement with california institute of technology for a non exclusive use license of its patent portfolio in the field of medical robotics 
international reorganization 
during the year ended december   we moved our international headquarters from france to switzerland 
we believe this reorganization will streamline our international operations and optimize our tax structure for the long term 
we do not anticipate realizing benefits from the lower tax rates until fiscal at the earliest 
the reorganization plan resulted in costs for relocation of the european operations and certain employees  severance of certain employees  the set up of new facilities and information technology infrastructure  and other costs associated with the transition 
based upon the plan  we incurred reorganization costs of approximately million in

revenue increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  total revenue growth was driven by the continued adoption of da vinci surgery 
we believe that robotic surgery will be adopted surgical procedure by surgical procedure 
our revenue growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures 
dvp has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst 
an increasing body of clinical evidence has indicated dvp to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal  continence  and sexual potency 
in and  dvh has been a much faster growing procedure on a percentage of growth basis 
favorable clinical results have been reported in hysterectomies for cancerous pathology  which include increased lymph node retrieval counts and significant reduction in blood transfusion 
for most patients  a minimally invasive approach using the da vinci surgical system offers reduced pain  less blood loss  shorter hospital stays and a quicker return to normal daily activities 
revenue within the united states accounted for of total revenue during the year ended december  and of total revenue during the years ended december  and we believe domestic revenue accounts for the large majority of total revenue due largely to the competitive nature of the domestic
