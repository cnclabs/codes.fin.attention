effective october   national commerce financial corporation ncf merged with suntrust 
the results of operations for ncf were included with our results beginning october  periods prior to the acquisition date do not reflect the impact of the merger 
in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  net interest income  net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis and the quarterly ratios are presented on an annualized basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
we believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
we also present diluted earnings per common share excluding merger expense and an efficiency ratio excluding merger expense that exclude merger charges related to the ncf acquisition 
we believe the exclusion of the merger charges  which represent incremental costs to integrate ncf s operations  is more reflective of normalized operations 
additionally  we present a return on average realized common shareholders equity  as well as a return on average common shareholders equity roe 
we also present a return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains losses and a return on average total assets roa 
the return on average realized common shareholders equity and return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains losses exclude realized securities gains and losses and the coca cola company dividend  from the numerator  and net unrealized securities gains from the denominator 
we present a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio  which excludes the cost of and the other effects of intangible assets resulting from merger and acquisition m a activity 
we believe these measures are useful to investors because  by removing the effect of intangible asset costs from merger and acquisition activity the level of which may vary from company to company  it allows investors to more easily compare our efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry 
the measures are utilized by management to assess our efficiency  and that of our lines of business  as well as our capital adequacy

table of contents introduction our headquarters are located in atlanta  georgia  and we operate primarily within florida  georgia  maryland  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia  and the district of columbia 
within the geographic footprint  we operated under five business segments during these business segments were retail  commercial  corporate and investment banking  wealth and investment management  and mortgage 
executive summary in  the financial services industry was significantly affected by turmoil in the financial markets created by a downturn in the consumer credit cycle  and specifically the residential housing market 
the deterioration in the credit markets created market volatility and illiquidity  resulting in significant declines in the market values of a broad range of investment products and loans 
we were not immune to the impacts of these market dynamics as our results clearly indicate through the increased provision for loan losses and net market valuation declines of various financial instruments carried at market value 
in the second half of  we recorded approximately million in net market valuation losses on financial instruments carried at fair value 
the majority of the market valuation loss was related to securities that were purchased from certain money market funds  as well as a multi seller commercial paper conduit that we sponsor 
despite this challenging operating environment  which also included intense deposit competition and a prolonged flat to inverted yield curve  we made considerable progress in our shareholder value oriented initiatives 
in the first and second quarters of  we conducted additional balance sheet restructuring activities related primarily to our mortgage and corporate loans and investment securities 
these actions were a continuation of the balance sheet management initiatives that began in these actions were designed to more efficiently utilize our balance sheet and resulted in an improvement in net interest margin  reduced credit exposure  and increased liquidity 
these actions resulted in a significant reduction in the size of the balance sheet  change in the mix of available for sale securities  and an increase in the size and active management of trading assets 
we also implemented the excellence in execution efficiency and productivity program e aimed at lowering our cost structure to drive higher financial performance and enhancing long term efficiency 
we have realized million in savings as a result of our e program and are well positioned going into to continue to more efficiently utilize resources while enhancing the overall customer service experience for our clients 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million in severance expense related to this program  which was recorded in other staff expense 
we anticipate the run rate of total cost savings of approximately million will be achieved during through initiatives identified in corporate real estate  supplier management  off shoring  and process organizational reviews 
these estimated cost savings do not include the cost of incremental investments or the benefit of non recurring gains associated with the e initiatives 
for the year ended december   we reported net income available to common shareholders of  million  or per diluted common share 
for the fourth quarter of  we reported net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share 
the following is a summary of our financial performance total revenue fte increased million  or  compared to total revenue included approximately million in net market valuation related losses  which were offset by growth in net interest income  the million gain on sale of the coca cola company stock  fee related noninterest income  and other gains  including real estate related gains from various sale leaseback transactions executed during net interest income fte increased million  or  and the net interest margin increased basis points to compared to the increase in net interest income and net interest margin was due to our balance sheet management initiatives that were implemented in and the average earning asset yield increased basis points compared to while the average interest bearing liability cost increased basis points  resulting in a basis point increase in interest rate spread 
total average earning assets decreased billion  or  to billion during  while total average customer deposits increased million  or  to billion during additionally  there was a shift in the mix of deposits to higher cost products  with certificates of deposits increasing  while other deposit products  specifically demand deposit accounts dda  money market  and savings  declined 

table of contents noninterest income decreased million  or  compared to the decrease was driven by million of mark to market valuation losses related to the purchase of securities from an institutional private placement fund that we managed  three pillars funding  llc  a multi seller commercial paper conduit that we sponsor and certain money market funds that we manage 
the acquired securities were predominantly aaa or aa rated at the time originally purchased by these entities 
in the fourth quarter of  while certain securities were not downgraded  these securities experienced an increase in the loss severity of the underlying collateral  which included alt a and subprime mortgages  resulting in a decline in market value of these securities 
the decrease in noninterest income was further impacted by market value declines in the mortgage loan warehouse and securitization and trading assets 
the impact of these valuation adjustments was substantially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of shares of the coca cola company  the gain recognized on sale leaseback transactions related to premises  and the market valuation gain on our public debt and related hedges carried at fair value 
noninterest expense increased million  or  compared to the increase was primarily driven by an increase in fraud losses  growth in compensation expense attributable to the election in to record certain newly originated mortgage loans held for sale at fair value  litigation expense related to our ownership in visa  inc visa  and severance expense incurred in association with e provision for loan losses increased million  or  compared to the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs for the year by million  primarily related to higher delinquencies and increased charge offs associated with residential real estate and home equity portfolios 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was for  up basis points from the increase in net charge offs was primarily related to residential real estate related loans 
nonperforming assets increased  million  compared to december   due primarily to the overall downturn in the housing market 
consolidated results adoption of fair value accounting standards during the first quarter of  we evaluated the provisions of the recently issued fair value accounting standards  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurement  and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
clarifies how to measure fair value when such measurement is otherwise required by us gaap  and sfas no 
provides companies with the option to elect to carry specific financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the provisions of sfas no 
establish clearer and more consistent criteria for measuring fair value 
the primary objective of sfas no 
is to expand the use of fair value in us gaap  with the focus on eligible financial assets and financial liabilities 
as a means to expand the use of fair value  sfas no 
allows companies to avoid some of the complexities of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 and more closely align the economics of their business with their results of operations without having to apply a mixed attribute accounting model for certain financial instruments under a hedging relationship 
based on our evaluation of these standards in relation to our balance sheet management strategies and objectives  we early adopted these fair value standards as of january  the following is a synopsis of our thought process regarding how to apply sfas no 
to our business the prolonged and unprecedented inversion in the yield curve and continued shift in deposit mix to higher cost products during the first quarter of resulted in further compression in net interest income and further exacerbated the need for us to alter the size and composition of our balance sheet ie  smaller loan and securities portfolio and larger trading portfolio 
recording financial assets and liabilities at fair value aligns with the active management of our balance sheet in relation to varying market conditions 
the accounting provisions of sfas no 
permit companies to record existing and future financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value and recognize changes in fair value through earnings  allowing for more active hedging and or trading of those assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
clarified a company s ability to transfer existing financial assets to trading assets without impacting the classification of future acquisitions of financial assets 

table of contents upon electing to record certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value and simultaneously hedging the changes in fair value  we were able to mitigate a significant amount of potential earnings volatility from changes in fair value 
the financial assets or financial liabilities we elected to record at fair value were entire classes of similar assets or liabilities that we decided to actively hedge and or trade 
we continue to evaluate new originations of eligible financial instruments to determine if we should elect to record these financial assets or liabilities at fair value 
we expect to make further fair value elections in the future when such elections align with our balance sheet management strategies 
we chose to sell entire classes of assets transferred to fair value  as we determined that it was no longer desirable to hold these assets on our balance sheet 
in addition  we reduced wholesale funding namely fed funds and other overnight borrowings and acquired securities that were significantly different than the securities we sold  resulting in a significantly different balance sheet composition that will improve our financial performance and reduce our earnings volatility especially pertaining to net interest income 
we evaluated the expanded use of fair value both at an entity wide level  as well as at the asset class level 
at adoption  our election to record at fair value several classes of financial assets and financial liabilities demonstrated the comprehensive nature of our balance sheet management strategies  and our intent to use fair value as a measurement attribute on a go forward basis 
furthermore  we expanded the use of fair value in each of these classes of financial assets and financial liabilities by electing fair value for new purchases and or issuances of securities  loans  and debt during the following discussion elaborates on our rationale for electing to record certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value  as well as provides relevant balance sheet and earnings information for those assets and liabilities carried at fair value 
see note  fair value  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the economic environment since early has created financial challenges for financial institutions  specifically constraining the ability to grow net interest income 
the flat to inverted yield curve has persisted for an unprecedented length of time compressing the interest spread on earning assets 
in addition  the general market environment has constrained customer deposit growth  as customers shifted deposits into alternative investments and or higher rate deposit products  accentuating the pressure on net interest margin 
average earning assets increased in compared to and the average yield increased basis points  while average customer deposits increased in and the average rate on interest bearing customer deposits increased basis points 
the increase in deposits was entirely in higher cost time deposits  increasing  while all other deposit products decreased 
of particular note  average demand deposits declined compared to the incremental earning asset growth not supported by customer deposits resulted in a increase in wholesale deposits  with an average rate in of approximately  which was more than basis points higher than the average rate in all of the above dynamics resulted in a basis point decline in our net interest margin during in order to respond to the reduction in net interest margin  we began employing specific asset liability management strategies beginning in the second quarter of that focused on moderating balance sheet growth 
these strategies involved moderately downsizing our loan and securities portfolios  focusing on lower yielding assets and reducing reliance on higher rate wholesale deposits 
we executed several specific transactions in that included the sale or securitization of billion of residential real estate loans and billion of student loans 
we elected to warehouse  and subsequently sell  residential real estate loans in the secondary market that in the past had been placed in portfolio 
additionally  we sold billion of shorter term securities  primarily mortgage backed and agency securities  with a average yield and reinvested approximately billion in longer term securities with a average yield 
this combination of transactions caused a billion reduction in the securities portfolio in the third and fourth quarters of finally  we executed billion in notional amount of receive fixed interest rate swaps  which were designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
on commercial loans  to extend the duration of the balance sheet and improve the overall earning asset yield 
we also restructured aspects of our capital in the third and fourth quarters of  reducing our cost of capital while strengthening our tier capital position 
these capital restructuring initiatives contributed to our well capitalized status  as tier capital increased to  as of december   up basis points from the prior year end 

table of contents the persistent challenging economic environment  exacerbated by an uncertain outlook for meaningful improvement  intensified in resulting in additional pressure on net interest income 
while the yield curve steepened some in december and january  the yield curve was again strongly inverted by the end of february consequently  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the size of our balance sheet through a structured asset sale of approximately billion of lower yielding  large corporate loans and also executed an additional billion notional of receive fixed interest rate swaps on floating rate commercial loans 
more significantly  we conducted a comprehensive review of our securities and loan portfolios  whereby we analyzed a variety of the portfolios characteristics  including absolute size  overall liquidity  customer collateral needs  credit and interest rate exposure  security type  and tier capital consumption 
as a result  we determined that it would be appropriate to significantly reduce the overall size of our securities and loan portfolios  as well as to modify our asset liability strategies to reduce balance sheet utilization and related wholesale funding  reduce risk weighted assets for tier capital purposes  reduce interest rate risk  significantly reduce credit risk  minimize redundancy between the securities portfolio and the mortgage loan portfolio  increase the overall portfolio yield  increase the use of derivatives to manage duration and significantly reduce the size of the available for sale securities portfolio and significantly increase the size of the trading securities portfolio 
as discussed in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  we early adopted the fair value accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
shortly after the issuance of sfas no 
in september  we began identifying positions that would be impacted by the provisions of sfas no 
in connection with the evaluation of sfas no 
 we also evaluated the draft provisions of sfas no 
generally  we support the elective use of fair value of financial instruments  as evidenced by our early adoption in of sfas no 
in certain circumstances  fair value enables a company to more accurately align its financial performance with the market value of actively traded or hedged assets or liabilities 
fair value enables a company to mitigate the non economic earnings volatility caused from financial assets and financial liabilities being carried at different bases of accounting  as well as to more accurately portray the active and dynamic management of a company s balance sheet 
the objectives of the new fair value standards align closely with our recent balance sheet management strategies 
subsequent to the final issuance of sfas no 
on february   we re evaluated the provisions of sfas no 
and the potential impacts of sfas no 
in addition to the impact of sfas no 
alleviating the burdens of fair value hedge accounting on certain elements of our debt and loans held for sale  we also evaluated other potential impacts of the final provisions of sfas no 
related to our recently formulated asset liability strategies that specifically related to the investment and loan portfolios 
the ability to record at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities resulted in us accelerating the deployment of the various asset liability strategies that we had been evaluating during the first quarter 
after an analysis of the potential impacts of these standards and discussions with our board of directors the board  we decided in late march to early adopt both sfas no 
and sfas no 
the aggregate impact to the first quarter due to early adopting these standards  including the related economic hedges  was a million benefit to pre tax income 
the annual financial impact from adopting these standards was considered by the compensation committee of the board in connection with the ordinary annual year end review of our performance 
the most significant financial impacts of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
related to valuing mortgage loans held for sale and the recording of the valuation of mortgage loan commitments related to loans intended to be held for sale that are derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of a closed loan includes the embedded cash flows that are ultimately realized as servicing value either through retention of the servicing asset or through the sale of a loan on a servicing released basis 
the valuation of loan commitments includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan 
these pull through rates are based on our historical data  which is a significant unobservable assumption 
prior accounting requirements under eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk managements activities  precluded the recognition of any day one gains and losses if fair value was not based on market observable data 
rather  these deferred gains and losses were recognized when the rate lock expired or when the underlying loan was ultimately sold 
the change in valuation methodology under sfas no 
accelerates the recognition of these day one gains and losses 
during the first quarter  we recognized a million reduction to mortgage production related income due to the acceleration of these day one losses previously deferred 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we recorded a million reduction to opening retained earnings 
in conjunction with adopting sfas no 
 we elected to record specific financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
these instruments include all  or a portion  of the following debt  available for sale debt securities  adjustable rate residential mortgage portfolio loans  securitization warehouses and trading loans 
as a result of recording these financial 
table of contents assets and liabilities at fair value as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we recorded in earnings in the first quarter of changes in these instruments fair values  as well as changes in fair value of any associated derivatives which would have otherwise been carried at fair value through earnings 
due to the unique retroactive application of the transition provisions  we have provided the following table that reflects the impact to opening retained earnings and first quarter earnings as a result of electing to carry these financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value and adopting the new fair value measurement requirements for the three months ended march  increase decrease dollars in thousands january  retained earnings net interest income trading account profits and commissions mortgage production related income fixed rate debt related hedges total investment securities related hedges total mortgage loans related hedges total securitization and trading assets mortgage loan commitments these amounts relate to the early adoption of sfas no 
upon electing to carry these assets and liabilities at fair value  we began to economically hedge and or trade these assets or liabilities in order to manage the instrument s fair value volatility and economic value 
the following is a description of each asset and liability class for which fair value has been elected  including the specific reasons for electing fair value and the strategies for managing the assets and liabilities on a fair value basis 
in association with adoption of the fair value standards  we recorded a reduction of million in retained earnings on january  fixed rate debt the debt that we elected to carry at fair value was all of our fixed rate debt that had previously been designated in qualifying fair value hedges using receive fixed pay floating interest rate swaps  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
this population specifically included billion of fixed rate federal home loan bank fhlb advances and billion of publicly issued debt 
we elected to record this debt at fair value in order to align the accounting for the debt with the accounting for the derivative without having to account for the debt under hedge accounting  thus avoiding the complex and time consuming fair value hedge accounting requirements of sfas no 
the reduction to opening retained earnings from recording the debt at fair value was million 
this move to fair value introduced potential earnings volatility due to changes in our credit spread that were not required to be valued under the sfas no 
hedge designation 
we estimated credit spreads above libor rates  based on trading levels of our debt in the market as of each reporting date 
based on this methodology  we recognized a gain of approximately million during due to changes in our credit spread 
all of the debt  along with the interest rate swaps previously designated as hedges under sfas no 
 continues to remain outstanding 
during the year ended december   we consummated two fixed rate debt issuances 
on september   we issued million of senior notes  which carried a fixed coupon rate of and had a term of years 
we did not enter into any hedges on this debt at issuance and  therefore  did not elect to carry the debt at fair value 
on november   we issued million of senior notes  which carried a fixed coupon rate of and had a term of years 
we did enter into hedges in connection with this debt issuance and as a result elected to carry this debt at fair value 

table of contents available for sale and trading securities the available for sale debt securities that were transferred to trading were substantially all of the debt securities within specific asset classes  whether the securities were valued at an unrealized loss or unrealized gain 
we elected to reclassify approximately billion of securities to trading at january   as well as an additional million of purchases of similar assets that occurred during the first quarter of the reduction to opening retained earnings related to reclassifying the billion of securities to trading was million 
this net unrealized loss was already reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and  therefore  upon reclassification to retained earnings  there was no net impact to total shareholders equity 
our securities portfolio is generally of high credit quality  such that the opening retained earnings adjustment was not significantly impacted by the credit risk embedded in the assets  but rather due to interest rates 
we elected to move these available for sale securities to trading securities in order to initially seed the trading securities portfolio that we intended to actively manage in connection with the overall management of our balance sheet 
the transfer of securities to trading enabled us to more actively trade a more significant portion of our investment portfolio and reduce the overall size of the available for sale portfolio 
in determining the assets to be sold  we considered economic factors  such as yield  collateral  interest terms  capital efficiency  and duration  in relation to our balance sheet strategies 
in evaluating our total available for sale portfolio of approximately billion at january   we determined that approximately billion of securities were not available or were not practicable to be fair valued and reclassified to trading under sfas no 
 as these securities had matured or been called during the quarter  were subject to business restrictions  were privately placed or had nominal principal amounts 
approximately billion of securities aligned with our recent balance sheet strategy  due to the nature of the assets such as year fixed rate mortgage backed securities mbs  adjustable rate mortgages arms  floating rate asset backed securities abs and municipal bonds  therefore  the securities continued to be classified as available for sale 
these securities yielded over  had a duration over  and were in a million net unrealized gain position as of january  the remaining billion of securities  which included hybrid arms  commercial mbs  collateralized mortgage obligations cmo and mbs excluding those classes of mbs that remained classified as securities available for sale  yielded approximately and had a duration under 
the approximate million of securities that were purchased in the first quarter and originally classified as available for sale were similar to the securities reclassified to trading on january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 accordingly  we reclassified these securities to trading pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
during the first quarter of  in connection with our decision to early adopt sfas no 
 we purchased approximately billion of treasury bills  which were classified as trading securities  and approximately billion of year fixed rate mbs  which were classified as securities available for sale 
we entered into approximately billion notional of interest rate derivatives to mitigate the fair value volatility of the available for sale securities that had been reclassified to trading 
finally  as part of our asset liability strategies  we executed an additional billion notional receive fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
on floating rate commercial loans 
during the second quarter of  we sold substantially all of the billion in securities transferred to trading at prices that  in the aggregate and including the hedging gains and losses  approximated the fair value of the securities at march   and terminated the interest rate derivatives we had entered into as hedges of the fair value 
we replaced a portion of these securities with an additional billion of treasury bills classified as trading and billion of year fixed rate mbs classified as available for sale 
in addition  we reduced wholesale overnight funding by approximately billion 
the year fixed rate mbs were a similar asset type to the securities that remained classified as available for sale but were substantially different from the securities reclassified to trading as part of our adoption 
these securities yielded over and had a duration of approximately 
subsequent to the transactions executed at the end of the first quarter and early second quarter  we continued to maintain an active trading portfolio  as well as refine our trading securities strategies 
as trading securities matured or sold  we purchased additional trading securities that included longer dated agency debentures  commercial paper  abs  corporate bonds  etc 
during the year ended december   we purchased approximately billion of trading securities for balance sheet management purposes 
in addition  during  we entered into billion of fhlb letters of credit that we elected to record at fair value and used these letters of credit to satisfy customer collateral and deposit requirements 

table of contents mortgage loans held for sale in connection with the early adoption of sfas no 
 we evaluated the composition of the mortgage loan portfolio including certain business restrictions on loans that are held by real estate investment trusts reits 
as part of our overall balance sheet management strategies during the second quarter of  we decided to no longer retain in our portfolio new originations of prime quality  mid term adjustable rate  highly commoditized  conforming agency and nonagency conforming residential mortgage portfolio loans in order to moderate the growth of earning assets  but had not undertaken plans to sell or securitize any of these loans held in the loan portfolio 
in connection with our recently formulated asset liability management strategies  we evaluated the composition of the mortgage loan portfolio  particularly in light of our plans to no longer hold the above mentioned mortgage loans in our portfolio  as well as our expectation to begin to record at fair value substantially all newly originated mortgage loans held for sale in the second quarter of based on this evaluation  we elected to carry billion of these types of loans held in the loan portfolio at fair value as of january  and transferred these loans to held for sale at the end of the first quarter 
the loans that we elected to move to fair value were not owned by a reit and had a weighted average coupon rate of approximately 
these loans were all performing loans and virtually none had been past due days or more over the prior month period 
the reduction to opening retained earnings related to these loans was million  which was net of a million reduction in the allowance for loan losses related to these loans 
in connection with recording these loans at fair value  we initiated hedging activities to mitigate the earnings volatility from changes in the loans fair value 
during the twelve months ended december   we sold or securitized billion of the billion of mortgage loans transferred to loans held for sale that  in the aggregate and including the hedging gains and losses  approximated the fair value of the mortgage loans at march   and terminated the interest rate derivatives we had entered into as hedges of the fair value 
as of december   billion of the billion in initially fair valued mortgage loans remained outstanding 
in the second quarter of  we began recording at fair value certain newly originated mortgage loans held for sale based upon defined product criteria 
we chose to fair value these mortgage loans held for sale in order to eliminate the complexities and inherent difficulties of achieving hedge accounting and to better align reported results with the underlying economic changes in value of the loans and related hedge instruments 
during  we elected to record at fair value billion of mortgage loans and classified these loans as held for sale 
as of december   there were billion of newly originated mortgage loans at fair value held for sale 
this election impacts the timing and recognition of origination fees and costs  as well as servicing value 
specifically  origination fees and costs  which had been appropriately deferred under sfas no 
and recognized as part of the gain loss on sale of the loan  are now recognized in earnings at the time of origination 
for the year ended december   approximately million in loan origination fees were recognized in noninterest income and approximately million in loan origination costs were recognized in noninterest expense due to this fair value election 
the servicing value  which had been recorded at the time the loan was sold as a mortgage servicing right  is now included in the fair value of the loan and recognized at origination of the loan 
we began using derivatives to economically hedge changes in servicing value as a result of including the servicing value in the fair value of the loan 
the estimated impact from recognizing servicing value  net of related hedging costs  as part of the fair value of the loan is captured in mortgage production income 
our mortgage loans held for sale are carried at either the lower of cost or market or fair value 
under either accounting basis  the value of these loans is susceptible to declines in market value 
recent market events have affected the value and liquidity of mortgage loans  but to varying degrees depending on the nature and credit quality of the mortgage loans 
the carrying value of our residential mortgage loans held for sale was billion as of december   including approximately million of alt a mortgage loans and no subprime mortgages 
during the second half of  investors concerns regarding the credit performance of subprime mortgages spread to other mortgage products  severely impacting the liquidity and market value of non agency mortgage loans in the secondary market 
as a result  we recorded approximately million in pre tax charges related primarily to losses on loan sales and declines in the market value of loans held for sale  including related hedges during the year 
the loans held for sale and related derivatives were valued based on observable market data of similar assets  where available  as well as current performance data of the underlying loans 
in instances when significant valuation assumptions were not readily observable in the market  instruments were valued based on the best available data in order to approximate fair value 
these market values are susceptible to volatility due to the effect of the credit related issues impacting the mortgage loan market  as well as the absence of market liquidity 
the value of these assets could be adversely impacted by further declines in market prices 
management limits the size and our overall exposure to these assets  as well as actively monitors the estimated market and economic value of these assets and determines the most advantageous approach to managing these assets 

table of contents securitization and trading loans as part of our securitization and trading activities  we often warehouse assets prior to sale or securitization  retain interests in securitizations  and maintain a portfolio of loans that we trade in the secondary market 
at january   we transferred to trading assets approximately million of loans  substantially all of which were purchased from the market for the purpose of sales into securitizations  which were previously classified as loans held for sale 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 we elected to carry warehoused and trading loans at fair value in order to reflect the active management of these positions and  in certain cases  to align the economics of these instruments with the hedges that we typically execute on certain of these loans 
we also elected to reclassify our residual interests to trading assets  consistent with other residual positions we own 
as of december   approximately million of the million of trading loans transferred into trading assets as of january  remained outstanding  and additional loans were purchased and recorded at fair value as part of our normal loan securitization and trading activities 
the assets securing these residual interests are primarily residential loans  commercial loans  corporate loans  and government sponsored student loans 
the total value of our securitization warehouses that we have elected to carry at fair value  excluding certain mortgage loan warehouses  was approximately million as of december  the assets held in the warehouses at december  include commercial loans 
these warehouses were mark to market as of december  and reflect our best estimate of fair value taking into consideration the markets into which these assets will be securitized and or sold and the credit quality of the assets held in the warehouse 
the size of our securitization warehouse has decreased significantly during as a result of valuation write downs  as well as our decision in the fourth quarter to exit certain aspects of the securitization business

table of contents net interest income margin fully taxable equivalent net interest income for was  million  an increase of million  or  from the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of balance sheet management strategies implemented throughout and lower yielding loans and investment securities were reclassified to loans held for sale and trading assets  respectively  and a portion of these assets was subsequently sold enabling a reduction in higher cost liabilities 
for  average earning assets decreased billion  or  while average interest bearing liabilities decreased billion  or  compared to this decline was a result of balance sheet management strategies  which resulted in the sale of nearly billion in loans during  primarily comprised of mortgage loans  student loans  and corporate loans 
average securities available for sale were billion during  a decrease of billion  or  compared to in the first quarter of  approximately billion of securities were reclassified into trading assets to enable more active trading of a significant portion of this portfolio and reduce the overall size of securities available for sale 
the decrease in average securities available for sale more than offset the growth of billion in interest earning trading assets and the billion growth in loans  net of the aforementioned sales of loans 
average consumer and commercial deposits increased billion  or  in compared to this included increases of billion in higher cost certificates of deposit and billion in now account balances

after exhibiting an upward trend during the first three quarters of  the net interest margin declined from during the third quarter of to during the fourth quarter of deposit pricing pressures along with declines in earning asset yields drove the decline  offset somewhat by the benefit of lower wholesale funding costs 
we expect to continue to experience slight compression in the first quarter of as a result of the impact of the trading securities purchased during the fourth quarter of and then expect net interest margin to stabilize and possibly even expand during the remainder of stabilizing or expanding margin will require some of the following to occur the pressure upon deposit pricing subsides  we achieve continued success in growing our deposit base  the yield curve steepens  the market demonstrates a normalized libor prime relationship  and the level of nonperforming assets stabilizes or declines 
the net interest margin trends occurred in a market environment characterized by a continued flat to inverted yield curve

this yield curve inversion negatively impacts us because rates on deposits  our most significant funding source  tend to track movements in three month libor while our loan yields tend to track movements in the five year swap rate 
certain floating rate loans  floating rate liabilities  and derivative contracts contractually reset to the prime rate as well as libor

table allowance for loan and lease losses as of december dollars in millions allocation by loan type commercial real estate consumer loans unallocated total year end loan types as a percent of total loans commercial real estate consumer loans total the allocations in the years through reflect the implementation of an alll methodology that is more granular than in prior periods 
this methodology segregates the portfolio into sub portfolios and incorporates a weighted average of expected loss derived from an internal risk rating system 
beginning in the allocation also includes the acquired portfolio of ncf 
in and prior periods  the allocation reflected an apportionment of the alll that had been categorized as environmental factors  which is now included in the company s homeogeneous loan pool estimates 
allowance for loan and lease losses we continuously monitor the quality of our loan portfolio and maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses alll sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we are committed to the timely recognition of problem loans and maintaining an appropriate and adequate alll 
at year end  the alll was  million  which 
table of contents represented of period end loans 
this compares with an alll of  million  or of loans as of december  in addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes  we employ a variety of modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk that are used to construct an appropriate alll 
our alll framework has three basic elements specific allowances for loans individually evaluated for impairment  a formula based component for pools of homogeneous loans not individually evaluated  and an unallocated component that is based on other inherent risk factors and imprecision associated with the modeling and estimation processes 
this framework enables us to align loss estimation practices with the different types of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the first element of the alll analysis involves the estimation of allowances specific to individual impaired loans 
in this process  specific allowances are established for nonaccruing loans greater than million based on analysis of the most probable sources of repayment  including discounted future cash flows  liquidation of collateral  or the market value of the loan itself 
as of december  and  the specific allowance related to impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the second element of the alll  the general allowance for homogeneous loan pools not individually evaluated  is determined by applying allowance factors to pools of loans within the portfolio that have similar risk characteristics 
the general allowance factors are determined using a baseline factor that is developed from an analysis of historical charge off experience and expected losses 
expected losses are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default derived from an internal risk rating process 
these baseline factors are developed and applied to the various loan pools 
adjustments may be made to baseline reserves for some of the loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
these influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting  concentration risk and or recent observable asset quality trends 
we continually evaluate our alll methodology seeking to refine and enhance this process as appropriate  and it is likely that the methodology will continue to evolve over time 
as of december  and  the general allowance calculations totaled  million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to deterioration in credit quality of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios 
the increases to reserves associated with these were partially offset by lower alll factors associated with the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 
the third element of the alll is the unallocated reserve that addresses inherent losses not included elsewhere in the alll 
qualitative factors of this third allowance element are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
these factors include the inherent imprecision in models and lagging or incomplete data 
as of december  and  the alll estimated with respect to the third element totaled million and million  respectively 
our charge off policy meets or exceeds regulatory minimums 
losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of days 
secured consumer loans  including residential real estate  are typically charged off between and days  depending on the collateral type  in compliance with ffiec guidelines 
commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on non accrual when principal or interest is past due for days or more unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in the legal process of collection 
accordingly  secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed 
subsequent charge offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects 
the ratio of the alll to total nonperforming loans decreased to as of december  from as of december  the decline in this ratio was due to a million increase in nonperforming loans driven primarily by a million increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans 
the increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans was driven primarily by deteriorating economic conditions including increased mortgage delinquency rates and declining home values in most markets that we serve along with maturation of the portfolio 
in addition to reserves held in the alll  we had million and million in other liabilities as of december  and  respectively  that represents a reserve against certain unfunded commitments  including letters of credit

beginning in  we utilized a more active trading portfolio as part of our asset liability management process  as evidenced by the purchase of approximately billion of trading assets and sales or maturities of billion of trading assets for balance sheet management purposes 
this activity along with the reclassification of billion of available for sale securities to trading upon electing fair value accounting for these instruments under sfas no 
see the adoption of fair value accounting standards discussion within md a resulted in a billion  or  increase in trading assets from december  to december  the trading securities purchased during included treasury bills  us agency notes  commercial paper  investment grade corporate bonds  and abs 
approximately billion of the trading securities acquired during were abs that were purchased from certain affiliated money market funds and three pillars see the introduction to md a 
the following is a description of the circumstances causing the acquisition of these illiquid abs during the third quarter of  we provided support for specific securities within an institutional private placement fund the private fund and consolidated the private fund as of september   resulting in the addition of approximately million of trading securities 
based on market conditions in the fourth quarter  we decided to close the private fund in a manner in which the private funds shareholders received their full principal and interest due  and we began actively managing these trading securities 
these trading securities consist of approximately residential mbs that were aaa rated at the time they were purchased 
due to increased losses within the underlying collateral  some of which is comprised of alt a or sub prime mortgages  as well as market illiquidity  the value of these securities was reduced by approximately million during as of december   the remaining fair value of the securities was million  and million in principal pay downs have been received since the securities were acquired 
in december  we purchased  through a combination of cash and notes  approximately billion in siv securities from the sti classic prime quality money market fund and the sti classic institutional cash management money market fund collectively  the funds at amortized cost plus accrued interest 
trusco  a wholly owned subsidiary of suntrust  is the investment adviser to the funds 
we took this action to protect investors in the funds from possible losses associated with these securities 
the siv assets were originally rated a p and were tier eligible securities when purchased 
the underlying collateral consists of a wide array of assets including  mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt and loan obligations  and corporate bonds 
approximately million of the siv securities are backed by high quality  liquid assets or sponsored by large  well capitalized banks that have publicly announced that they are providing liquidity and support to these programs 
all of these higher quality or bank sponsored siv securities mature by june the remaining siv securities have gone into a restructuring process  and the ultimate timing and form of repayment is not known at this time 
we recorded a pre tax mark to market valuation loss of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of purchasing these securities 
also in december  we purchased million in abs  at amortized cost plus accrued interest  from three pillars in order to reduce the risk profile of the conduit 
these securities consist of residential mbs and collateralized debt obligations  with of the bonds currently aaa rated and the remainder aa rated 
during the fourth quarter of  the rapid deterioration in the performance of the underlying collateral  some of which is comprised of sub prime and alt a mortgages  as well as market illiquidity began to materially decrease the market value of these securities  as a result  we recorded a market value loss of million in the fourth quarter of see the off balance sheet arrangements  section of md a for additional discussion of three pillars 
due to the illiquid nature of these abs and the market as a whole in the fourth quarter of  the estimated market value of these securities is based on market information  where available  along with significant  unobservable third party data 
as a result of the high degree of judgment and estimates used to value these illiquid securities  the market values could vary significantly during see the estimates of fair value section within critical accounting policies for further discussion of these estimates 
we did not have a contractual or implicit obligation to purchase these securities or provide additional support to the funds or three pillars 
the assets of the funds and three pillars have been restructured  therefore  we do not anticipate similar valuation issues with the assets of the funds or three pillars 
the purchase of these securities should not be considered a precedent for future actions or commitment by us to provide additional support

we managed the portfolio in as part of a balance sheet restructuring to improve the yield  extend the duration  enhance the credit quality  and reduce the size in order to reduce our use of wholesale funding 
a significant part of the portfolio restructuring occurred in the first quarter of in conjunction with our early adoption of sfas no 
generally  we elected to reclassify as trading assets those available for sale securities that were lower yielding  shorter maturity  and that had greater credit risk 
virtually all of these trading assets were subsequently sold in the second quarter of and the proceeds were used to purchase other trading securities and to repay wholesale debt 
the remaining securities that we retained as available for sale were primarily our longest duration  higher yielding mbs which were issued or guaranteed by federal agencies 
in addition  we purchased similar high quality mbs issued by federal agencies during the year to reinvest cash flow from maturities and prepayments to maintain a relatively constant portfolio size after the restructuring 
the average yield for improved to compared to during the yield for the fourth quarter of was 
we extended the portfolio s effective duration from as of december  to as of december  effective duration is a measure of the estimated price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to an immediate change in interest rates  taking into consideration embedded options 
an effective duration of suggests an expected price change of for a one percent instantaneous change in interest rates 
the enhancement in credit quality is reflected in the change in asset mix shown in table we significantly reduced our holdings of abs and corporate bonds  as well as commercial mbs cmbs and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
as of december   of our securities were rated aaa  the highest possible rating by nationally recognized rating agencies with the majority of these being mbs issued by federal agencies 
the size of the securities portfolio decreased significantly from billion at december  to billion at december  this decrease in size reduced the investment portfolio as a percent of total assets from to over the same time period 

table of contents net securities gains of million were realized during  primarily due to a million gain from the sale in the second quarter of of million shares of our holdings of the common stock of the coca cola company 
net securities losses realized for the year ended december  were million  and million for the year ended december  the carrying value of the available for sale investment portfolio reflected billion in net unrealized gains at december   substantially all of which related to unrealized gains on our investment in common stock of the coca cola company 
the net unrealized gain on the remaining portion of our holdings of this equity investment increased million compared to december  in addition to the million gain realized on the sale discussed above 
the net unrealized gain on the remainder of the portfolio was million  an improvement of million compared to december  these changes in market value did not affect our net income  but were included in other comprehensive income 
we review all of our securities with unrealized losses for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
as a result of these reviews in the fourth quarter of  we determined that no impairment charges related to securities owned with unrealized losses were deemed other than temporarily impaired this quarter since we have the present intent and ability to retain these securities until recovery

money market accounts declined billion  or  savings accounts declined billion  or  and noninterest bearing dda account balances declined billion  or 
the decline in these products was the result of deposit migration to higher cost time deposits as well as customers moving balances to alternative investments such as repurchase agreements or money market mutual funds to take advantage of higher interest rates in response to the interest environment that prevailed during average brokered and foreign deposits decreased by billion  or  during compared to the decrease was due to our efforts to reduce our reliance upon wholesale funding sources through balance sheet restructuring actions 
consumer and commercial deposit growth is one of our key initiatives  as we focus on deposit gathering opportunities across all lines business throughout the geographic footprint 
we have instituted a number of initiatives to attract deposits including the my cause campaign which provides enrollment incentives to depositors  the modification of incentive plans to place greater emphasis on deposit and package account sales  enhancing online banking products and partnering with other well known brands in deposit oriented promotions 
as of december  these efforts were successful in generating new accounts and households  specifically  the my cause campaign generated over  checking accounts 
however  the new accounts had not translated into higher overall deposit balances

we are committed to remaining well capitalized and have set a tier target ratio for the company of 
this ratio declined during with much of the decrease taking place during the fourth quarter moving from at september  to at december  we expect the tier ratio to be restored to the targeted level via the potential issuance of enhanced trust preferred securities qualifying as regulatory capital  and transactions we are currently evaluating with respect to our holdings of common stock in the coca cola company that would yield an increase in tier capital 
the decline in our capital ratios during was the result of the net impact of the following factors effective january   we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
the adoption of these fair value standards resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings  which was partially offset by a increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the transfer of approximately billion in available for sale investment securities to trading assets 
see adoption of fair value accounting standards in md a and note  fair value  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
also effective january   we adopted fin which resulted in a reduction of total equity of million 
we also adopted fsp fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction  effective january  the adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction of total equity of million 
on february   we amended our retirement benefits plans  supplemental benefits plans and our other postretirement welfare plans

ah 
the replacement capital covenants are more fully described in current reports on form k filed on september   november  and december  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding md a 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require our judgment about matters that are highly uncertain and different estimates that could be reasonably applied would result in materially different assessments with respect to ascertaining the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  or reducing a liability 
our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the financial services industry 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of our current accounting policies that we have deemed critical 
allowance for loan and lease losses the alll represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on our review and evaluation of larger loans that meet our definition of impairment and the size and current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the loan portfolio and our assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
impaired loans  except for smaller balance homogeneous loans  include loans classified as nonaccrual where it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is deemed impaired  the amount of specific allowance required is measured by a complete analysis of the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan s estimated market value 
in these measurements  we use assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  our judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the specific alll estimates 
general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating several factors historical loss 
table of contents experience  current internal risk ratings based on our internal risk rating system  internal portfolio trends such as increasing or decreasing levels of delinquencies  concentrations  and external influences such as changes in economic or industry conditions 
unallocated allowances relate to inherent losses that are not included elsewhere in the alll 
the qualitative factors associated with unallocated allowances are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
these factors include the inherent imprecision in models and credit quality statistics and lagging or incomplete data 
our financial results are affected by the changes in and absolute level of the alll 
this process involves our analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate alll 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved  should it experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the alll 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for loan losses 
during  we experienced an increase in delinquency and net charge offs in residential real estate loans due to the deterioration of the housing market 
the alll considered these market conditions in deriving the estimated alll  however  given the continued economic uncertainty the ultimate amount of loss could vary from that estimate 
for additional discussion of the alll see the allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan losses sections of md a 
estimates of fair value we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
the extent to which we use fair value on a recurring basis was significantly expanded upon the early adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
during the first quarter  effective on january  examples of this recurring use of fair value include derivative instruments  available for sale and trading securities  loans held for sale accounted for at fair value  long term debt accounted for at fair value and certain residual interests from company sponsored securitizations 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with sfas no 
examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include loans held for sale accounted for at the lower of cost or market  msrs  goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
these valuation techniques and assumptions are in accordance with sfas no 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
fair value determination in accordance with sfas no 
requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
first  where prices for identical assets and liabilities are not available  application of the three level hierarchy established by sfas no 
would require that we identify  what we believe to be  similar assets and liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of nonperformance 
our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make are inherently difficult to determine and use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
as required under sfas no 
 the use of significant  unobservable inputs in our models is described in detail in note  fair value  to the consolidated financial statements 
in instances where required by us gaap  we use discount rates in our determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as retirement and other postretirement benefit obligations  msrs and residual interests from company sponsored securitizations 
discount rates used are those considered to be commensurate with the risks involved 
a change in these discount rates could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities 
we provide disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and residual interests and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  securitization activity and msrs  to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of msrs is based on discounted cash flow analyses 
a detailed discussion of key variables  including the discount rate  used in the determination of retirement and other postretirement obligations is in contained in the pension accounting section below 

table of contents in estimating the fair values for investment securities and most derivative financial instruments  we believe that independent  third party market prices are the best evidence of exit price and where available  base our estimates on such prices 
if such third party market prices are not available on the exact securities that we own  fair values are based on the market prices of similar instruments  third party broker quotes or are estimated using industry standard or proprietary models whose inputs may be unobservable 
when market observable data is not available  the valuation of financial instruments becomes more subjective and involves substantial judgment 
the need to use unobservable inputs generally results from the lack of market liquidity for certain types of loans and securities  which results in diminished observability of both actual trades and assumptions that would otherwise be available to value these instruments 
the distressed market conditions  that began in the third quarter of and have continued after year end  have impacted our ability to obtain third party pricing data for our investments in sivs and certain other abs and collateralized debt obligations  particularly those backed by subprime or alt a loans 
even when third party pricing has been available  the reduced trading activity resulting from current market conditions has challenged the observability of these quotations 
when fair values are estimated based on internal models  we will consider relevant market indices that correlate to the underlying collateral  along with assumptions such as liquidity discounts  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates and discount rates 
the fair values of loans held for investment recorded at fair value and loans held for sale are based on observable current market prices in the secondary loan market in which loans trade  as either whole loans or as abs 
when securities prices are obtained in the secondary loan market  we will translate these prices into whole loan prices by incorporating adjustments for estimated credit enhancement costs  loan servicing fees and various other transformation costs  when material 
the fair value of a loan is impacted by the nature of the asset and the market liquidity and activity 
when observable market prices are not available  for example as a result of the current illiquidity in the market for certain loan products  we will use judgment and estimate fair value using internal models 
if broker pricing is available  despite the lack of market observable trades  we will obtain broker pricing for a population of loans and extrapolate this data across a larger loan population 
even if limited market data is available  the characteristics of the underlying loan collateral are critical to arriving at an appropriate fair value in the current markets  such that any similarities that may otherwise be drawn may be questionable 
when estimating fair value  we will make assumptions about prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severity rates and liquidity discounts 
absent comparable current market data  we believe that the fair value derived from these various approaches is a reasonable approximation of the prices that we would receive to sell the loans 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated selling costs 
estimates of fair value are also required when performing an impairment analysis of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
we review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount  if any  by which goodwill is impaired 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units  we use discounted cash flow models which require assumptions about growth rates of the reporting units and the cost of equity 
to the extent that adequate data is available  other valuation techniques relying on market data may be incorporated into the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 
for long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in determining the fair value  management uses models which require assumptions about growth rates  the life of the asset  and or the market value of the assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount may not be recoverable 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business and estimate income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based upon a current estimate of net income  tax credits  and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year 
the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the future and is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted 
table of contents statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results 
we periodically evaluate our uncertain tax positions and estimate the appropriate level of tax reserves related to each of these positions 
this evaluation involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity around the ultimate resolution of these matters 
pension accounting several variables affect the annual pension cost and the annual variability of cost for our retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the employee population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns  other actuarial assumptions and healthcare cost 
below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on our pension costs 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans  and other factors including salary  age  and years of employment 
a reorganization was announced during which will result in the plan population decreasing through judgments will be required on our part to determine how this reorganization will impact the characteristics of the employee population  listed above as one of the key variables affecting our calculation 
discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  december  this assumption is updated every year for each plan 
the discount rate for each plan is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans  and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the suntrust and ncf retirement plans  the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was in and this expected rate of return is dependent upon the asset allocation decisions made with respect to plan assets 
we modified this allocation at the end of by reducing the pension trust equity exposure  resulting in a prospective change to the expected long term rate of return on plan assets beginning in from to 
annual differences  if any  between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
we generally amortize any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a corridor  as defined in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees  which is approximately eight years 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if we were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
recognition of actual asset returns sfas no 
allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  we have elected to use the preferable method in determining pension cost 
our method uses the actual market value of the plan assets 
therefore  we will experience more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors do not tend to change significantly 
table of contents over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
we periodically review the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
healthcare cost assumed healthcare cost trend rates also have an impact on the amounts reported for the postretirement plans 
due to changing medical inflation  it is important to understand the effect of a one percent point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
if we were to assume a one percent increase in healthcare cost trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a million and million increase  respectively 
if we were to assume a one percent decrease in healthcare trend rates  the effect on the other postretirement benefit obligation and total interest and service cost would be a of million and million decrease  respectively 
to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of december   we projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  salary changes different from expectations  entrance of new participants  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions 
enterprise risk management in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various risks 
to manage the major risks that we face and to provide reasonable assurance that key business objectives will be achieved  we have established an enterprise risk governance process and formed the suntrust enterprise risk program serp 
moreover  we have policies and various risk management processes designed to effectively identify  monitor and manage risk 
we continually refine and enhance our risk management policies  processes and procedures to maintain effective risk management and governance  including identification  measurement  monitoring  control  mitigation and reporting of all material risks 
over the last several years  we have enhanced risk measurement applications and systems capabilities that provide management information on whether we are being appropriately compensated for the risk profile we have adopted 
we balance our strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the risks associated with achieving our goals 
effective risk management is an important element supporting our business decision making 
corporate risk management s focus is on synthesizing  assessing  reporting and mitigating the full set of risks at the enterprise level  and providing senior management with a holistic picture of the organization s risk profile 
we have implemented an enterprise risk management framework that has improved our ability to manage our aggregate risk profile 
at the core of the framework are our risk vision and mission 
risk vision to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities consistent with those of top tier financial institutions that support the needs of the business  enable risk enlightened management and the optimal allocation of capital 
risk mission to promote a strong risk management culture which facilitates accountability  risk informed decisions consistent with the bank s strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value 
our chief risk officer cro reports to the chief executive officer and is responsible for the oversight of the risk management organization as well as risk governance processes 
the cro provides overall leadership  vision and direction for our enterprise risk management framework 
in addition to the centralized corporate risk management function  each line of business and corporate function has its own risk manager and support staff 
these risk managers  while reporting directly to their respective line of business or function  facilitate communications with corporate risk functions and execute the requirements of the enterprise risk management framework and policies 
corporate risk management works in partnership with the risk managers to ensure alignment with sound risk management practices as well as industry best practices 
organizationally  we measure and manage risk according to three main risk categories credit risk  market risk including liquidity risk and operational risk including compliance risk 
the chief credit officer manages our credit risk program and the chief market risk officer manages our market risk program 
the chief operational risk officer manages our operational risk program 
these three areas of risk are managed on a consolidated basis under our enterprise risk management framework  which also takes into consideration legal and reputational risk factors 

table of contents in  we continued to make significant enhancements to our enterprise risk management function 
the model validation and enterprise risk measurement groups continued to provide reasonable assurance that risks inherent in model development and usage are properly identified and managed to oversee the calculation of economic capital 
risk identification  assessment and mitigation planning were formally incorporated into the strategic planning process 
serp continued to ensure that the approach and plans for risk management are aligned to the vision and mission of enterprise risk management in addition to managing regulatory compliance 
in addition  serp s goal is to ensure our future compliance with the basel ii capital accord 
key objectives of serp include incorporating risk management principles that encompass company values and standards and are designed to guide risk taking activity  maximizing performance through the balance of risk and reward and leveraging initiatives driven by regulatory requirements to deliver capabilities to better measure and manage risk 
as part of our risk governance framework  we have also established various risk management related committees 
these committees are jointly responsible for ensuring adequate risk measurement and management in their respective areas of authority 
these committees include asset liability management committee alco  corporate product risk assessment committee prac  credit management committee and the serp steering committee 
additionally  we have established an enterprise risk committee erc  chaired by the cro  which is responsible for supporting the cro in measuring and managing our aggregate risk profile 
the erc consists of various senior executives throughout the company and meets on a monthly basis 
the board of directors is wholly responsible for oversight of our corporate risk governance process 
the risk committee of the board  which was formed in  assists the board of directors in executing this responsibility 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of suntrust clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under interest rate and foreign exchange derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services we provide to our clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of our lines of business and our capital adequacy 
we manage and monitor extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews 
we maintain underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures  and credit risk management conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures 
credit risk management periodically reviews our lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies 
in particular  total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored 
we have made a major commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to be compliant with business requirements and evolving regulatory standards 
as part of a continuous improvement process  suntrust credit risk management evaluates potential enhancements to our risk measurement and management tools  implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk are evaluated using our risk rating methodology  which has been implemented in the lines of business representing the largest total credit exposures 
we use various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses 
these models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  we collect internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of our risk models used in default and loss estimation 
operational risk management we face ongoing and emerging risks and regulations related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  security risks  country risk  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly 
we believe that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution 
our operational risk management function oversees an enterprise wide framework intended 
table of contents to identify  assess  control  quantify  monitor  and report on operational risks company wide 
these efforts support our goals in seeking to minimize operational losses and strengthen our performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
operational risk management is overseen by our chief operational risk officer  who reports directly to the chief risk officer 
the corporate governance structure also includes a risk manager and support staff embedded within each line of business and corporate function 
these risk managers  while reporting directly to their respective line or function  also report indirectly to the chief risk officer and are responsible for execution of the operational risk management program within their areas 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net interest income and economic value of equity eve to adverse movements in interest rates  is our primary market risk  and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet 
we are also exposed to market risk in our trading activities  msrs  loan warehouse and pipeline  debt carried at fair value and equity holdings of the coca cola company common stock 
the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our open positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
the policies established by alco are reviewed and approved by our board of directors 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within policy limits approved by the board and within narrower guidelines established by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the major sources of our non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as repricing gap analysis 
one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which is used to model net interest income from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a two year time horizon 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments 
this analysis incorporates several assumptions  the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non contractual maturities 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  spread narrowing and widening  and yield curve twists 
each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer behavior in an interest rate scenario 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities 
in  we updated our deposit repricing assumptions and the base case yield curve from which sensitivity analysis is derived now the implied forward curve 
further  the sensitivity is now measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to an instantaneous basis point move instead of a gradual basis point move 
we believe instantaneous shifts are more robust and better illustrate sensitivities 
estimated changes set forth below are dependent upon material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
the net interest income profile is relatively flat with respect to instantaneous bp changes in rates 
economic perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  
table of contents the december  net interest income sensitivity profiles include the impact from adopting sfas no 
specifically  the net interest payments from billion of receive fixed swaps are now reflected in trading income versus net interest income 
the benefit to net interest income due to a decline in short term interest rates will be recognized as a gain in the fair value of the swaps and will be recorded as an increase in trading account profits and commissions 
the recognition of interest rate sensitivity from an economic perspective above is different from a financial reporting perspective below due to the use of fair value accounting for these interest rate swaps and related underlying debt 
hence  the above profile includes the recognition of the net interest payments from these swaps  while the profile below does not include the net interest payments 
financial reporting perspective rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  we also perform valuation analysis  which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis 
whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as eve 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
similar to the net interest income simulation  eve uses instantaneous changes in rates 
eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model 
as with the net interest income simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
as of december   the eve profile indicates a negative change with respect to instantaneous bp changes in rates due to the value sensitivity of msrs 
rate shock basis points estimated change in eve december  december  while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current fiscal year 
further  eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the net interest income simulation and valuation analyses eve do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
trading activities in  we evaluated various balance sheet management initiatives and implemented several changes to our asset liability management strategies 
one of these changes was the expanded use of trading securities as part of our overall balance sheet management 
these trading securities were initially seeded by the transfer of approximately billion in securities previously classified as available for sale 
subsequent to the initial transfer as of january   we have continued to actively manage a significant amount of trading securities as part of our asset and liability management strategies 
we purchased and classified as trading and therefore measured at fair value through earnings approximately billion of trading securities during the year subsequent to the initial transfer 
the composition and duration of these securities has changed over the course of the year in conjunction with changes to our asset and liability management strategies  as well as changing market conditions 

table of contents we initially purchased us treasury bills  which were used primarily as collateral for public fund customer deposits 
our public fund collateral strategy has evolved during the year in part due to changes in the state laws that govern this matter 
as us treasury bills became increasingly expensive relative to other types of securities  we shifted some of our trading securities to longer dated us agency debentures and also began using fhlb letters of credit as public fund collateral 
in addition  we began purchasing corporate debt issued by other banks in the third quarter as a partial hedge to the market volatility to our own corporate debt  which was carried at fair value under sfas no 
further  corporate treasury has acquired various abs  commercial paper  as well as other corporate bonds during the second half of as part of our balance sheet management efforts  which evidences our expanded use of fair value accounting 
the remainder of our actively traded securities  other than corporate treasury trading securities  are designed to support customer requirements through our broker dealer subsidiary 
product offerings to customers include debt securities  loans traded in the secondary market  equity securities  derivatives and foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments 
other trading activities include acting as a market maker in certain debt and equity securities 
typically  suntrust maintains a securities inventory to facilitate customer transactions 
also in the normal course of business  we assume a degree of market risk in proprietary trading  hedging  and other strategies  subject to specified limits 
suntrust has developed policies and procedures to manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a value at risk var approach that determines total exposure arising from interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the maximum loss from a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var exposures and actual results are monitored daily for each trading portfolio 
our var calculation measures the potential losses in fair value using a confidence level with a one day holding period 
this means that  on average  losses are expected to exceed var two or three times per year 
the average undiversified var undiversified var represents a simple summation of the var calculated across each book that makes up the total book of business  such as fixed income  foreign exchange  derivative  etc 
was million for and million for trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged billion for and billion for the period end undiversified var was million at december  and million at december  trading assets net of trading liabilities were billion at december  and billion at december  increases in trading assets and risk are due primarily to the acquisition of trading securities and the adoption of fair value accounting in in addition  trading assets and risk as at december  include securities purchased from affiliated funds and a conduit funding vehicle 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
suntrust manages this risk by structuring its balance sheet prudently and by maintaining borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
we assess liquidity needs in the form of increases in assets  maturing obligations  or deposit withdrawals  considering both operations in the normal course of business and in times of unusual events 
in addition  we consider the off balance sheet arrangements and commitments we have entered into  which could also affect our liquidity position 
the corporate alco measures this risk  sets policies  and reviews adherence to those policies 
in addition  the risk committee of the board sets liquidity limits and reviews current and forecasted positions at each regularly scheduled meeting 
our sources of funds include a large  stable deposit base  secured advances from the fhlb and access to the capital markets 
we structure our balance sheet so that illiquid assets  such as loans  are funded through customer deposits  long term debt  other liabilities and capital 
customer based core deposits  our largest and most cost effective source of funding  accounted for of the funding base on average for compared to for average customer based core deposits increased billion  or  compared to as part of our balance sheet restructuring in  we have reduced our reliance on wholesale funding on a consolidated basis 
total wholesale funding  including net short term unsecured borrowings  net secured wholesale borrowings and long term debt  totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  net short term unsecured borrowings  including wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds  totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december   while net short term and long term secured borrowings totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  most of this reduction in wholesale borrowing has been at suntrust bank 
liquidity is also managed at the parent company on a standalone basis to ensure that sufficient liquidity is always available in the form of cash  liquid assets  and borrowing sources to meet all obligations of the parent company as they become due 

table of contents in addition  alco and the risk committee of the board have established appropriate liquidity measures and ratios at the parent company  as a standalone entity  to provide a sufficient amount of liquidity to meet unforeseen circumstances 
disruptions in the financial markets during the second half of created additional demands on liquidity at the parent 
while the liquidity position of the parent company has remained strong  we plan to supplement parent liquidity in the future  including the potential issuance of securities during we maintain access to a diversified base of wholesale funding sources 
these non committed sources include fed funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable certificates of deposit  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank note issuance and commercial paper issuance 
in november  suntrust increased its global bank note program total capacity to billion of aggregate principal outstanding 
as of december   suntrust bank had billion remaining capacity under its global bank note program 
suntrust established the program to expand funding and capital sources to include both domestic and international investors 
in keeping with that objective  in may the bank issued a million year floating rate note at gbp libor basis points and swapped the proceeds back to us dollars via a cross currency interest rate swap 
liquidity is also available through unpledged securities in the investment portfolio and capacity to securitize loans  including single family mortgage loans 
our credit ratings are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings 
significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources 
we manage reliance on short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by alco 
we have a contingency funding plan that stresses the liquidity needs that may arise from certain events such as agency rating downgrades  rapid loan growth  or significant deposit runoff 
the plan also provides for continual monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of liquidity 
management believes the company has the funding capacity to meet the liquidity needs arising from potential events 
as detailed in table  we had billion in unused lines of credit at december  that were not recorded on our balance sheet 
commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to a customer who has complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
we also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit that provide that suntrust bank fund if certain future events occur 
of this  approximately billion support variable rate demand obligations vrdos remarketed by suntrust and other agents 
vrdos are municipal securities which are remarketed by the agent on a regular basis  usually weekly 
in the event that the securities are unable to be remarketed  suntrust bank would fund under the letters of credit 
certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent us from creating liens on  disposing of  or issuing except to related parties voting stock of subsidiaries 
further  there are restrictions on mergers  consolidations  certain leases  sales or transfers of assets  and minimum shareholders equity ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements 
as of december   our cumulative unrecognized tax benefits amounted to million million on an after tax basis  including million million on an after tax basis of interest 
these unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns and the benefits recognized and measured in accordance with fin the unrecognized tax benefits are based on various tax positions in several jurisdictions and  if taxes related to these positions are ultimately paid  the payments would be made from our normal  operating cash flows  likely over multiple years

other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential and commercial mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary market  commitments to customers to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary market  and our investment in msrs 
we manage the risks associated with the residential and commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale ie  the warehouse and our interest rate lock commitments irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouses and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential and commercial real estate loans 
the risk associated with the warehouses and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary market  which is typically days 
we manage interest rate risk predominantly with interest rate swaps  futures and forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the forward sale agreements substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouses and the irlcs 
irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and are not designated in sfas no 
hedge accounting relationships 
the most significant financial impact of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
related to valuing mortgage loan commitments 
the valuation of these loan commitments includes assumptions related to the amount of commitments that ultimately result in closed loans 
under sfas no 
 the full value of these loan commitments  excluding servicing value  is recognized at the loan commitment date 
prior accounting requirements under eitf  precluded the recognition of a portion of the loan commitment s value  which was deferred until the loans underlying the commitments were ultimately sold 
the change in valuation methodology under sfas no 
accelerates the recognition of certain components of the commitment s value 
msrs are the discounted present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
the value of msrs is highly dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan 
table of contents pays off earlier than anticipated 
we have not historically hedged the msr asset for this risk  however  we have employed a balanced business strategy using the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production  and may employ other financial instruments  including economic hedges  to manage the performance of the business 
during  we began economically hedging our msrs portfolio given increased downside risk to the valuation in the current interest rate environment 
we have and will continue to economically hedge the risk associated with the change in value of msrs imbedded in the irlcs prior to loan funding 
the fair value determination  key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the msrs as of december  and december  is discussed in greater detail in note  securitization activity and msrs  to the consolidated financial statements 
we are also subject to risk from changes in equity prices that arise from owning the coca cola company common stock 
we own million shares of common stock of the coca cola company  which had a carrying value of billion at december  a decrease in share price of the coca cola company common stock at december  would result in a decrease  net of deferred taxes  of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income 
off balance sheet arrangements we assist in providing liquidity to select corporate clients by directing them to a multi seller commercial paper conduit that we administer  three pillars funding  llc three pillars 
three pillars provides financing for direct purchases of financial assets originated and serviced by our corporate clients 
three pillars finances this activity by issuing a p rated commercial paper cp 
the result is an attractive funding arrangement for these clients 
as of december  and december   three pillars had assets not included on our consolidated balance sheets of approximately billion and billion  respectively  consisting primarily of secured loans 
funding commitments and outstanding receivables extended by three pillars to its customers totaled billion and billion  respectively  as of december   almost all of which renew annually 
assets supporting those commitments have a weighted average life of years 
the majority of the commitments are backed by trade receivables and commercial loans  which collateralize and  respectively  of the outstanding commitments 
each transaction added to three pillars is typically structured to an implied a a rating according to established credit and underwriting policies as approved by credit risk management 
each transaction is monitored on a monthly basis  or more frequently  to ensure compliance with each transaction s terms and conditions 
typically  transactions contain dynamic credit enhancement structures that provide increased credit protection in the event asset performance deteriorates 
if asset performance deteriorates beyond pre determined covenant levels  the transaction could become ineligible for continued funding by three pillars 
this could result in the transaction being amended with the approval of our credit risk management or being funded under the liquidity facility provided by us in connection with the transaction 
in addition  each commitment renewal requires credit risk management approval 
during the year ended december   there were no write downs and no downgrades of three pillars assets  however  see the following discussion relating to the liquidity commitments for trading losses taken by us for securities purchased from three pillars pursuant to those arrangements 
at december   three pillars outstanding cp used to fund the above assets totaled billion  with remaining weighted average lives of days and maturities through april  three pillars has no other form of funding outstanding as of december  beginning in the third quarter of  the overall us asset backed commercial paper abcp market experienced a disruption which continued through the remainder of the year 
despite the continued ongoing disruptions in and contraction of the cp market  three pillars experienced no significant difficulties in issuing its cp and has been able to place daily its commercial paper in the third party cp market 
during the third quarter of  we  in our sole discretion  elected to purchase a limited amount of three pillars cp although we were under no obligation  contractual or otherwise  to do so 
the aggregate face amount of three pillars issued commercial paper purchased in the third quarter totaled million 
the three pillars cp was classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a trading asset and was purchased at market rates ranging from to  with maturities ranging from days to days 
this amount represented less than of three pillars total issuance for the year ended december  our purchase of the commercial paper did not alter our conclusion that we are not three pillars primary beneficiary 
we hold no outstanding three pillars cp at december  three pillars has an outstanding subordinated note to an unrelated third party who is expected to absorb the majority of three pillars expected losses 
the subordinated note holder absorbs the first dollar of loss in the event of nonpayment of any of three pillars assets 
the subordinated note matures in march  however  the note holder may declare the note due and 
table of contents payable upon an event of default  which includes any loss drawn on the note funding account that remains unreimbursed for days 
in such an event  only the remaining balance of the first loss note  after the incurred loss  will be due 
if the first loss note holder declared its loss note due under such circumstances and a new first loss note or other first loss protection was not obtained  we would likely consolidate three pillars on a prospective basis 
the outstanding and committed amounts of the subordinated note were million and million at december  and million and million  at december   respectively 
three pillars obtained an increase in the commitment and available funding under the subordinated note during the year ended december  due to the difficult market condition and interest rate environment 
we believe the subordinated note is sized in an amount sufficient to absorb the expected loss of three pillars based on current commitment levels as well as for forecasted growth in three pillars assets 
should future losses reduce the subordinated note funding account below its required level or if the note is reduced to a size deemed insufficient to support the growth of assets in three pillars  we would likely be required to consolidate three pillars  if an amendment of the current subordinate note or a new subordinate note could not be obtained 
based on our analysis of three pillars outstanding assets and total commitments at december   the outstanding subordinated note would need to be less than million to be considered insufficient to absorb the majority of three pillars expected losses 
we believe events resulting in consolidation are unlikely to occur  however  should we consolidate three pillars  the potential impact to our debt covenants  capital ratios  credit ratings  or dividends are not expected to be significant 
we reconsider our involvement with three pillars on an ongoing basis  including each time a client originates or pays off a financing in three pillars 
this reconsideration process may result in an increase or a decrease in the note commitment  as needed to continue to absorb the majority of the expected losses of three pillars 
based on an ongoing analysis of the expected losses of three pillars  which includes consideration of the size of the subordinated note  we concluded we were not three pillars primary beneficiary  and thus we are not required to consolidate three pillars 
our involvement with three pillars includes the following activities services related to our administration of three pillars activities  client referrals and investment recommendations to three pillars  the issuing of letters of credit  which provides partial credit protection to the commercial paper holders  and providing a majority of the liquidity arrangements that would provide funding to three pillars in the event it can no longer issue commercial paper or in certain other circumstances 
activities related to the three pillars relationship generated total fee revenue for us  net of direct salary and administrative costs incurred by us  of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
there are no other contractual arrangements we plan to enter into with three pillars to provide it additional support 
off balance sheet commitments in the form of liquidity facilities and other credit enhancements provided by us to three pillars  the sum of which represents our maximum exposure to potential loss  totaled billion and million  respectively  as of december  compared to billion and million  respectively  as of december  the liquidity commitments are revolving facilities that are sized based on the current commitments provided by three pillars to its customers 
three pillars had one additional liquidity commitment outstanding at december  from a third party unrelated to us in the amount of million 
obligation to fund and repayment of any draws on the third party liquidity facility are pari passu to the liquidity commitment outstanding by the company 
the liquidity facilities are generally used if new commercial paper can not be issued by three pillars to repay maturing commercial paper 
however  the liquidity facilities are available in all circumstances  except certain bankruptcy related events with respect to three pillars 
draws on the facilities are subject to the purchase price or borrowing base formula that  in many cases  excludes defaulted assets to the extent that they exceed available over collateralization in the form of non defaulted assets  and may also provide the liquidity banks with loss protection equal to a portion of the loss protection provided for in the related securitization agreement 
additionally  there are transaction specific covenants and triggers that are tied either to the performance of the assets of the relevant seller servicer that may result in a transaction termination event  which  if continuing  would require funding through the related liquidity facility 
finally  in a termination event of three pillars  such as if its tangible net worth falls below  for a period in excess of days  three pillars would be unable to issue cp which would likely result in funding through the liquidity facilities 
drawings under the credit enhancement are also available in all circumstances  but are generally used to the extent required to make payment on any maturing commercial paper if there are insufficient funds from collections of receivables or the use of liquidity facilities 
the required amount of credit enhancement at three pillars will vary from time to time as new receivables pools are purchased or removed from its asset portfolio  but is generally equal to of the aggregate commitments of three pillars 

table of contents we manage the credit risk associated with these commitments by subjecting them and the underlying collateral assets of three pillars to our normal credit approval and monitoring processes 
losses on the commitments provided to three pillars by us resulting from a loss due to nonpayment on the underlying assets are reimbursed to us from the subordinated note reserve account  which is the amount outstanding on the subordinated note agreement 
during the year ended december   three pillars qualified abs were funded by our liquidity facility supporting those abs for a discussion of the nature of these securities see the trading assets discussion within md a 
the liquidity was drawn based on three pillars decision to exit those types of investments due to an acceleration in the deterioration of the performance of the underlying collateral and market illiquidity in the fourth quarter of resulting in a material decrease in the market value of those securities 
pursuant to the liquidity facility agreement  the abs were sold to us in order to allow us to manage our associated credit and market risk 
the purchase price under the liquidity facility for the qualified abs equaled the amortized cost of the abs plus the related unpaid cp interest used to fund those investments which  in total  amounted million 
subsequent to the purchase  three pillars  along with us  canceled the related liquidity agreement 
of the investments included in the purchase  only one security in the amount of million had experienced a decline in credit to such an extent that management believed a future realized loss on the abs was likely to occur if the security was held to maturity 
as a result of the purchase of the qualified abs  we recognized an unrealized loss of million during the fourth quarter of due to the significant decrease in the market value of the abs 
the remaining assets in three pillars are primarily seller receivables and since inception  three pillars has not drawn on any liquidity facilities for a customer receivable transaction 
these receivables have the benefit of dynamic credit enhancement features and are not subject to the same level of market risk as the abs that were purchased from three pillars 
we considered these factors  among others  in assessing whether we would suffer additional losses based on our involvement with three pillars and are not aware of additional uncertainties or unfavorable trends within three pillars for which we expect to suffer material losses 
we have variable interests in certain other securitization vehicles that are variable interest entities vies that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary 
in such cases  we do not absorb the majority of the entities expected losses nor do we receive a majority of the expected residual returns 
at december   total assets of these entities not included on our consolidated balance sheets were approximately billion compared to billion at december  at december   our maximum exposure to loss related to these vies was approximately million  which represents our investment in senior interests of million as of december  and interests in preference shares of million compared to a maximum exposure of million as of december   relating exclusively to our interests in preference shares 
we have no off balance sheet or other implicit variable interests related to these entities 
as part of our community reinvestment initiatives  we invest in multi family affordable housing properties throughout our footprint as a limited and or general partner 
we receive affordable housing federal and state tax credits for these investments 
partnership assets of approximately million and million in partnerships where we are only a limited partner were not included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
our maximum exposure to loss for these limited partner investments totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
our maximum exposure to loss related to our affordable housing limited partner investments consists of the limited partnership equity investments  unfunded equity commitments  and debt issued by us to the limited partnerships 
we recorded million in impairment charges during the fourth quarter of in association with these interests 
trusco  a registered investment advisor and our wholly owned subsidiary  serves as the investment advisor for various private placement and publicly registered investment funds collectively the funds 
we periodically evaluate these funds to determine if the funds are voting interest or variable interest entities  and monitor the nature of our interests in each fund to determine if we are required to consolidate any of the funds 
while we do not have any contractual obligation to provide monetary support to the funds  we did elect to provide support for specific securities within a single institutional private placement fund the fund during the third quarter of this action  combined with certain limitations on the third party voting rights  led us to conclude that we were the primary beneficiary  which resulted in the consolidation as of september  of approximately million in trading securities and a similar amount of other liabilities that represented the minority interest obligations of the fund 
after a thorough evaluation of the fund within the current market conditions  we further elected to close the fund in november as a result  we purchased the securities of the fund at the securities amortized cost plus accrued interest  and fund shareholders received their full principal and interest due in cash 
we are now managing the trading securities that were received from the fund as part of our actively managed trading portfolio 
due to increased losses with respect to the collateral underlying these securities  we recorded market valuation losses of approximately million during see  trading assets in md a for further discussion 

table of contents we are the managing general partner of a number of non registered investment limited partnerships which have been established to provide alternative investment strategies for our clients 
in reviewing the partnerships for consolidation  we determined that these were voting interest entities and accordingly considered the consolidation guidance contained in eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
under the terms of our non registered investment limited partnerships  the limited partners have certain rights  such as the right to remove the general partner  or kick out rights  as indicated in eitf issue no 
therefore  we  as the general partner  are precluded from consolidating the limited partnerships
