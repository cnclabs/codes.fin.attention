item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview telik is engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development and our research programs may require significant additional research and development expenditures  including for preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval 
we outsource our clinical trials and our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  and from non equity payments from collaborative partners 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the outcome of our clinical trial activities 
the successful development of our products is uncertain 
as such  an accurate prediction of future operating results is difficult or impossible 
product development telcyta  our lead product candidate  is a small molecule tumor activated cancer product candidate that we are evaluating initially to treat cancers that are resistant to standard chemotherapy drugs 
in december  we reported preliminary results indicating that the phase assist and assist trials did not achieve their primary endpoint of demonstrating statistically significant improvement in overall survival for telcyta as compared to the active controls 
the assist trial showed a major discordance between the clinical review of the tumor scans and the independent radiology review and therefore the results of this trial have been compromised and not suitable for regulatory submission 
we completed in depth analyses of the data of all three trials including discussion of the results with oncology experts and at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology or asco on june  we presented final results that confirmed the preliminary results reported in december we continue to follow patients treated on the assist trial for survival 
in may  we initiated another multinational randomized phase clinical trial  assist  to evaluate telcyta in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin  or pld versus pld alone as second line therapy in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer 
on june   a full clinical hold for telcyta was initiated by the fda following the presentation of the phase clinical trial results at the asco annual meeting 
as a result  we stopped enrolling new patients on telcyta clinical trials  and patients being treated on the trials could not receive additional treatment until such time that the fda released the clinical hold 
on june   the fda converted the full clinical hold on telcyta to a partial hold  thereby enabling patients 
table of contents that had been enrolled in the assist and assist trials the opportunity to continue to receive study treatments  including telcyta in combination with chemotherapy  subject to re consenting procedures 
on october   the fda completed their review of our telcyta data and removed the partial hold  permitting the resumption of telcyta clinical development 
we plan to conduct an interim analysis with the patients currently enrolled in the assist trial  and based on the results of this analysis we will assess the feasibility of continuing this study 
in addition  we have conducted two phase clinical trials of telcyta for the treatment of stage iiib or iv non small cell lung cancer for patients who have not previously received chemotherapy 
one clinical trial was in combination with cisplatin  and the other clinical trial was in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
platinum and taxane based drug combinations are the current standard for the front line chemotherapy of lung and ovarian cancer 
in april  at the annual meeting of the american association for cancer research  we announced final results from the phase clinical trial of telcyta in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
we continue to follow patients treated on this trial for survival 
telintra  our second product candidate  is a small molecule bone marrow stimulant we are developing for the treatment of blood disorders associated with low blood cell levels  such as neutropenia or anemia 
myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds  is a disease characterized by defects in the blood producing cells of the bone marrow  in which low blood cell levels occur 
a phase clinical trial in patients with mds was completed in december with clinically significant improvement demonstrated in all blood cell lineages and across all major mds subtypes 
telintra was well tolerated in this predominantly elderly patient population 
in february  we initiated a phase a trial in mds using a tablet formulation of telintra 
at the th annual meeting of the american society of hematology in december  we reported positive clinical data demonstrating that telintra tablets are well tolerated and clinically active in patients with all stages of mds 
tlk  a novel metabolically activated cytotoxic small molecule with activity not restricted to gst positive cancers  was identified as a new product candidate in tlk causes apoptosis and g m cell cycle arrest in a broad array of human cancer cell lines including those not expressing gst p it has shown significant anti tumor activity in human breast  pancreatic and colon tumors in pre clinical models of human cancer when administered either orally or by injection 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies to support the potential filing of an ind application with the fda 
using our trap technology we discovered a mcp antagonist  c  a small molecule that prevents leukocyte infiltration  a process linked to tissue injury in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis 
in january  we announced an agreement with sri international  or sri  under which sri will fund and conduct preclinical studies of c for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we discovered all of our product candidates using our proprietary technology  target related affinity profiling  or trap  which enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule product candidates 
we expect to enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties  such as contract research organizations for clinical trials  development  manufacturing  regulatory approvals or commercialization of some of our products  particularly outside north america  or in disease areas requiring larger and longer clinical trials than cancer 
restructuring plan in february  we implemented a restructuring plan that focused our priorities on the assist trial and the phase a trial of telintra tablets and selected research and development programs 
to match these priorities  we reduced our workforce by positions  or approximately of our workforce  streamlined our infrastructure and postponed some clinical research projects 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a one time restructuring charge of approximately million of which approximately million was paid in the quarter ended march  as severance  payroll taxes and other personnel related costs 
the remaining 
table of contents payments of approximately  were paid in the quarter ended june  approximately  of the restructuring charge was reversed in the quarter ended june  as certain health benefits accrued were not utilized 
the restructuring plan has been completed and we will continue to investigate alternative opportunities for the advancement of our product development programs  including collaborations with pharmaceutical and larger biotechnology companies 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted sfas r  and use the fair value method to account for share based payment awards following the modified prospective method of adoption which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
under the provisions of sfas r  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
our expected stock price volatility assumption for is a blended rate of of historical volatility and implied volatility since sufficient market activity exists with respect to our traded options 
in  historical volatility  obtained from public data sources  was used 
the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with sab as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimation 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we adjusted our forfeiture rate to reflect the cancellation of unvested options due to the workforce reduction in february and voluntary terminations 
see also note  stock based compensation  and note  stock based compensation under sfas r  in the notes to financial statements for further information 
if factors change and we develop different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors  consultants and third party contract research organizations and an allocation of facility and administrative costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical 
table of contents activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the on going development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations revenues years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages contract revenue from collaborations we had no collaborative research agreements in and while revenues in resulted from our collaborative agreement with hoffmann la roche  inc  or roche 
we completed our roche compound identification revenue amortization in march we currently do not expect to record any revenue in the next twelve months 
future revenues will depend upon the extent to which we enter into new collaborative research agreements and the amounts of payments relating to such agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug development  clinical supply manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates and preclinical studies 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximate the following years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages research and preclinical clinical development total research and development 
table of contents total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following clinical trial expenses reduction of approximately million as study activities in our assist  assist  assist and phase clinical trials are near completion  partially offset by costs related to our assist clinical trial of approximately million  corresponding decreased costs in our clinical drug supply manufacturing cost of approximately million 
other expenses reduction of approximately million associated with lower headcount as a result of our corporate restructuring and corresponding reduction in clinical activities  lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily due to higher estimated forfeiture rates used in to reflect the cancellation of unvested options for higher than estimated level of termination and complete vesting of stock options granted in earlier periods partially offset by expense associated with new stock options granted 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following clinical trial expenses approximately million associated with our assist clinical trial and initial start up costs related to our assist clinical trial  offset by decreased costs associated with our phase clinical trials in ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer of approximately million following the completion of patient enrollment in our assist and assist clinical trials  and corresponding decreased costs in our clinical drug supply manufacturing cost of approximately million 
other expenses approximately million associated with headcount growth and increased expenses to support clinical activities  and stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
we expect total research and development expenditures to decrease in the next twelve months as we focus on the phase clinical trials of telintra tablets  preclinical studies on tlk and reduced development of telcyta 
specifically  we expect both clinical and manufacturing expenditures to be lower than previous years and the timing and the amount of these expenditures will depend on the results of the interim analysis of the assist trial and the progress of the telintra tablets phase clinical trials 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product candidate 
the information in the column labeled estimated or actual completion of enrollment is our current estimate of the timing of completion of enrollment 
the actual timing of completion of enrollment could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the risk factors all of our product candidates are in research and development 
if clinical trials of telcyta and telintra are delayed or unsuccessful or if we are unable to complete the preclinical development of our other preclinical product candidates  our business may suffer  if we do not obtain 
table of contents regulatory approval to market products in the united states and foreign countries  we or our collaborators will not be permitted to commercialize our product candidates  as our product programs advance  we may need to hire additional scientific and management personnel 
our research and development efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  and if we are unable to enter into or maintain existing contracts with third parties to manufacture our product candidates or any products that we may develop in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost  clinical development of product candidates could be delayed and we may be unable to meet demand for any products that we may develop and lose potential revenue sections of risk factors in item a above 
product description phase of development estimated or actual completion of enrollment related r d expenses years ended december  in thousands telcyta ovarian  assist phase non small cell lung  assist phase ovarian  assist phase ovarian  assist phase combination with other drugs phase telintra mds phase mds tablets phase a other total research and development expenses other constitutes research and development activities performed by our chemistry  biology  preclinical and quality assurance departments as these costs cannot be allocated to any individual project 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our on going investment in our research and development activities and  in particular  the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct initial human clinical trials for drug candidates  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate  and filing by company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a new drug application  or nda  for a product candidate to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in view of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these and other factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative the decrease of  or  in compared to the same period in resulted from a decrease in stock based compensation expense of approximately million due to higher estimated forfeiture rates used in to reflect the cancellation of unvested options for higher than estimated level of termination and complete vesting of stock options granted in earlier periods partially offset by expense associated with new stock options granted 
in addition  expenses decreased by approximately  as a result of our corporate restructuring and lower administrative expenses 
the decrease in expense was partially offset by a million increase in legal expenses and other related costs primarily due to our securities class action lawsuit 
the increase of  or million in compared to the same period in was primarily due to stock based compensation expense of million 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to remain at approximately the same spending level as stock based compensation expense employee stock based compensation expense related to our share based payment awards recognized under sfas r was as follows in millions years ended december  in thousands except per share amount research and development general and administrative stock based compensation expense before taxes related income tax benefits effect on net loss stock based compensation expense includes amounts for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas  and compensation expense for share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfasr 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  is recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
the decrease in employee stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  compared with the same period for was consistent with the change in the attribution method upon the adoption of sfas r along with an increase in our forfeiture rate from to to reflect the cancellation of unvested options due to a higher than originally estimated level of terminations 

table of contents restructuring costs as a result of our workforce reduction of positions  or approximately of our workforce  we recorded a one time restructuring charge of approximately million for severance costs and other charges in the quarter ending march  we reversed approximately  of this charge in the quarter ended june  as certain health benefits originally accrued were not utilized 
the restructuring plan was completed as of june  interest income and interest expense years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income expense  net interest expense interest and other income expense  net of million  million and million for the years ended december   and resulted primarily from earnings on investments 
the decrease in was due to lower investment cash balance and included a write down expense of approximately  of three investments due to changes in market conditions resulting in an other than temporary impairment 
the increase in was due to higher average interest rates in compared to interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and the increase in interest expense in was due to interest associated with a buy out option on leased equipment 
the decrease in interest expense in was due to decreasing outstanding principal balance as a result of payments on our lease and loan obligations and no new borrowings 
we expect interest expenditures to decrease in the future as our lease and loan obligations were fully paid off at december  liquidity and capital resources in millions  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to the significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  interest earned on investments and equipment lease financings 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies  high grade corporate and municipal bonds  commercial paper  auction rate preferred securities and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared with million in and million in net loss of million in included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation  million for depreciation and amortization  and million for the write down of marketable securities 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued clinical trials related primarily to the near completion of our assist  and clinical trials and a million reduction in accounts payable 
cash used in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation and million for depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operations in was further impacted by a decrease of million in accrued clinical trials expenses  primarily due to our phase clinical trials and a million decrease in accrued compensation expense primarily due to bonus payouts 
cash outflows in were offset by an increase of million in accrued liabilities related mainly to manufacturing expenses and million in accounts payable 
cash used in operations in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operations in was further impacted by an approximately million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to payment of clinical development activities and million repayments to our landlord for leasehold improvements which were financed by them 
cash outflows in were offset by increases of million in accrued clinical trial expenses related primarily to our phase clinical trials 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for was million compared to million in and million in cash provided in was primarily from million in maturities of investments and million from sales of investments partially offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
capital expenditures in were  primarily for laboratory equipment purchases 
cash provided in was primarily from million in sales and maturities of investments offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
capital expenditures in were  primarily for laboratory equipment  computer equipment and software purchases 
cash was provided in by million from sales and maturities of investments  partially offset by million in purchases of investment securities 
capital expenditures for were million primarily related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system and purchase of computer and laboratory equipment 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was approximately  compared with million in and million in financing activities in were comprised primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by  in payments under capital leases and equipment loans 
financing activities for were comprised primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by  in payments under capital leases and equipment loans 
financing activities for included approximately million in net proceeds from our follow on public offering of common stock completed in february and million from stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock plans offset by million in pay down of capital leases and equipment loans 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of cash for operating expenses and our telcyta and telintra development programs 
based on our current development plan  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until the end of changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing may subject us to restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  
table of contents rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  the progress and number of research programs in development  the costs associated with conducting phase clinical trials  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the timing and scope of commercialization expenses for our product candidates as they approach regulatory approval 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
our future contractual obligations at december  are as follows total after in thousands operating leases we have a contractual obligation under the terms of our manufacturing supply agreement with organichem corporation  wherein we are obligated to purchase a majority of our united states requirements for the active ingredient in telcyta for a number of years 
however  we currently do not have any requirements for the active ingredient 
we have agreed on a pricing schedule for such supply  which will be subject to future renegotiation after a defined time period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax provisions  an interpretation of sfas statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires a company to recognize  in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis solely on the technical merit of the position 
in addition  fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures including a discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next twelve months as well as a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on september   the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to do so for recognition or disclosure purposes 
the 
table of contents standard provides a common definition of fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to significantly affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb also reached consensus on emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of eitf  but do not expect the adoption to significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward looking statements 
we do not use or hold derivative financial instruments  however we are exposed to market risk related to changes interest rates and market conditions 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
our marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities and commercial papers with an average maturity of under one year and a minimum investment grade rating of a or a or better to minimize credit risk 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
approximately million of our investment portfolio is invested in corporate and municipal notes investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities and auction preferred stock securities 
since september  million invested in auction preferred stock securities have failed to settle in scheduled auctions 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not  but does not result in the securities going into default because the issuer continues to pay interest at higher rates 
the failures resulted in the interest rates on these investments resetting at higher rates every days at one month libor plus basis points for as long as auctions continue to fail 
while we now earn premium interest rates on these investments  these investments are not liquid and their carrying amounts are impaired due to the adverse change in the corporate debt market 
we concluded that the impairment is other than temporary and we have written down the carrying amount for these investments to approximately million and recognized a loss of approximately  in the year ended december  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record additional impairment charges on these investments 
these illiquid investments continue being rated aa and are paying interest at december  in february  auctions failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities without significant loss within the next year  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired as the underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flow needs  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as planned
