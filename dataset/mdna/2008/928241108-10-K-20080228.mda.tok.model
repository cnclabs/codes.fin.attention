item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation background we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that address serious infectious diseases  with a focus on products used by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
we intend to grow through sales of our marketed product  vancocin hcl capsules  through the continued development of our product pipeline and through potential acquisition or licensing of products or acquisition of companies 
we have one marketed product and multiple product candidates in clinical development 
we market and sell vancocin hcl capsules  the oral capsule formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride  in the us and its territories 
vancocin is a potent antibiotic approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat antibiotic associated pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile infection cdi  or c 
difficile  and enterocolitis caused by staphylococcus aureus  including methicillin resistant strains 
we are developing camvia tm maribavir for the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus  or cmv  disease  and hcv for the treatment of hepatitis c virus  or hcv  infection 
we have entered into a licensing agreement for the rights to develop non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile ntcd for the treatment and prevention of cdi 
we have licensed the us and canadian rights for a third product development candidate  an intranasal formulation of pleconaril  to schering plough for the treatment of picornavirus infections 
in addition  we have a discovery stage program in hepatitis c 
we intend to evaluate in licensing or other opportunities to acquire products in development  or those that are currently on the market 
we plan to seek products for diseases treated by physician specialists and in hospital settings to complement the markets that we hope our cmv and hcv programs will serve or in which vancocin is prescribed 
while we were profitable from operations since  prior to the acquisition of vancocin  our first commercial product  we incurred historical losses 
historical losses resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  write off of acquired technology rights  general and administrative expenses  interest payments on our outstanding debt and sales and marketing expenses 
executive summary during  we experienced the following development activities cmv began patient recruitment and dosing in a second phase clinical study of camvia in liver transplant patients  continued patient recruitment and dosing in an ongoing phase clinical study of camvia in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant  continued patient recruitment and dosing in five ongoing phase studies  began executing our development plan for the camvia program in europe  initiated prelaunch activities including medical affairs and pr initiatives in preparation for planned nda 
hcv with our partner wyeth discontinued dosing of hcv in an ongoing phase combination study of the drug following a review by the joint safety review board of safety data which showed elevated liver enzyme levels in a subset of patients  trial participants continue to receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin in this study  continued to monitor and follow up with patients in the phase study  began evaluation of potential risks to patients to understand if further clinical studies are appropriate 
c 
difficile infection cdi continued work to optimize manufacturing and scale up of non toxicigenic c 
difficile spores  conducted successful meeting with us food and drug administration to elucidate ntcd development plan 
financial results 
table of contents increased working capital by million to million  primarily driven by the issuance of our senior convertible notes and operating income  net sales increased as compared to and were impacted by fluctuations in prescriptions  which increased in as compared to  and pricing  which was higher during as compared to  and wholesaler inventory levels which were stable in compared to decreased levels in increased development costs by million in over to million 
liquidity generated net cash from operating activities of million 
increased cash and cash equivalents and short term investments by million to million 
during and going forward  we expect to face a number of challenges  which include the following the commercial sale of approved pharmaceutical products is subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future vancocin sales will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  for reasons that include  but are not limited to  generic and non generic competition for vancocin and or changes in prescribing habits or disease incidence 
additionally  period over period fluctuations in net product sales are expected to occur as a result of wholesaler buying decisions 
we cannot assure you that generic competitors will not take advantage of the absence of patent protection for vancocin to attempt to market a competing product 
we are not able to predict the time period in which a generic drug may enter the market 
on march   we learned that the ogd changed its approach regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a generic drug applicant to request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing for copies of vancocin 
we are opposing this attempt 
however  in the event this change in approach remains in effect  the time period in which a generic competitor may enter the market would be reduced and multiple generics may enter the market  which would materially impact our operating results  cash flows and possibly asset valuations 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with the positions stated in our vancocin related submissions or that our efforts to oppose the ogd s march recommendation to determine bioequivalence to vancocin through in vitro dissolution testing will be successful 
we cannot predict the timeframe in which the fda will make a decision regarding either our citizen petition for vancocin or the approval of generic versions of vancocin 
if we are unable to change the recommendation set forth by the ogd in march  the threat of generic competition will be high 
we will face intense competition in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring additional products to expand further our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting business development activities 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 
the outcome of our clinical development programs is subject to considerable uncertainties 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing and ultimately commercializing any of our product candidates  that the fda or other regulatory authorities will not require additional or unanticipated studies or clinical trial outcomes before granting regulatory approval  or that we will be successful in gaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates in the timeframes that we expect  or at all 
for example  in august  we and wyeth decided to discontinue dosing with hcv in a phase study as a result of potential safety concerns 
we and wyeth continue to evaluate the observations that led to this decision in the hope of advancing this potential therapeutic agent in the future  however there can be no assurance that we will conduct additional hcv studies in the future as the fda or other regulatory authorities may either prohibit any future studies with hcv or alternatively may require additional or unanticipated studies or clinical trial outcomes before granting regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments or cash flows from vancocin sales will be sufficient to fund all of our ongoing development and operational costs  as well as the interest payable on the senior convertible notes  over the next several years  that planned clinical trials can be initiated  or that planned or ongoing clinical trials can be successfully concluded or concluded in accordance with our anticipated schedule and costs 
moreover  the results of our business development efforts could require considerable investments 
our actual results could differ materially from those results expressed in  or implied by  our expectations and assumption described in this annual report on form k 
the risks described in this report  our form k for the year ended 
table of contents december  are not the only risks facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results

results of operations years ended december  and for the year ended december  in thousands net product sales total revenues cost of sales excluding amortization of product rights operating income net income net income per share basic diluted the increase in net income for resulted primarily from the million increase in sales  along with a million reduction in the cost of sales 
the million increase in operating income resulted from factors described above  offset by the increased costs to support our cmv and hcv development programs 
the year ended december  includes million share based compensation expense and million of costs associated with our opposition to the ogd s change in approach 
revenues revenues consisted of the following for the year end december  in thousands net product sales license fees and milestones revenues total revenues revenue vancocin product sales our net product sales are solely related to vancocin 
we sell vancocin only to wholesalers who then distribute the product to pharmacies  hospitals and long term care facilities  among others 
our sales of vancocin are influenced by wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  wholesaler buying decisions related to their desired inventory levels  and  ultimately  end user prescriptions  all of which could be at different levels from period to period 
during the year ended december   net sales of vancocin increased compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase of units sold  the impact of a price increase during and wholesaler inventory levels which that were stable in compared to decreased levels in we believe  based upon data reported by ims health incorporated  that prescriptions during the year ended december  exceeded prescriptions in the period by 
approximately of our sales are to three wholesalers 
vancocin product sales are influenced by prescriptions and wholesaler forecasts of prescription demand  which could be at different levels from period to period 
we receive inventory 
table of contents data from one of our three largest wholesalers through our fee for service agreement 
we do not independently verify this data 
based on this inventory data and our estimates  we believe that as of december   the wholesalers did not have excess channel inventory 
cost of sales vancocin cost of sales includes the cost of materials and distribution costs and excludes amortization of product rights 
the decrease of million over the prior year primarily results from the sale of units manufactured by npi pharmaceuticals formerly osg norwich  which carry a lower inventory cost 
during and the second half of  all of the finished product we purchased was produced by npi pharmaceuticals 
as of june   lilly no longer manufactured finished product for us because our third party manufacturing supply chain was approved in the second quarter of and in july  we began receiving regular shipments of product produced by npi pharmaceuticals 
our finished product that was sold in the second half of included product produced by both lilly and npi pharmaceuticals 
as such  our cost of sales began to steadily decrease in the second half of and remained consistent during since units are shipped based upon earliest expiration date  our cost of sales will be impacted by the cost associated with the specific units that are sold 
additionally  we may experience fluctuations in quarterly manufacturing yields and if this occurs  we would expect the cost of product sales of vancocin to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  stock compensation and other overhead costs 
due to recent advancements in our clinical development programs  we expect future costs to exceed current costs 
research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the years ended december  in thousands direct core programs cmv hcv vancocin ntcd direct non core programs common cold indirect development total 
table of contents direct expenses core development programs our direct expenses related to our cmv program increased significantly in as we advanced the program into larger phase clinical studies 
specifically  during the year we continued recruitment into an ongoing phase study of camvia in patents undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant and began recruiting patients into a second phase study in patients undergoing liver transplantation during the second quarter of we began executing on our pre launch plans for our clinical  regulatory and commercial activities for the camvia program in europe 
during the year we concluded analysis of data from our phase clinical trial with camvia  which demonstrated that camvia significantly reduces cmv reactivation in patients who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
we initiated dosing in a phase study of camvia in the prevention of cmv disease in allogeneic stem cell transplantation and continued conducting and analyzing data from various phase clinical trials 
we also prepared for a second phase study of camvia in solid organ transplant patients 
included in the cmv expenses during was million related to a milestone payment due to glaxosmithkline associated with the initiation of the phase study of camvia  which was paid in february related to our hcv program  costs in primarily represent those paid to wyeth in connection with our cost sharing arrangement related to discovery efforts to identify potential back ups follow on compounds to hcv development activity for our hcv product candidate  hcv  during the year included completion of enrollment in the mg bid arms of a phase study of hcv when dosed in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and ongoing follow up of patients in that study 
in august  we announced that elevated liver enzyme levels in a subset of patients in this study indicated a potential safety issue 
consequently  all dosing with hcv was discontinued  although patients in the phase study had the option of continuing to receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin as per standard of care 
therefore  monitoring and follow up of patients in the phase study will continue 
during the year  we conducted a phase b clinical trial which demonstrated the antiviral activity of hcv in combination with pegylated interferon and began dosing in a phase study of hcv wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses

anticipated fluctuations in future direct expenses are discussed under liquidity development programs 
direct expenses non core development programs we incurred minimal direct costs related to our common cold program licensed to schering plough 
indirect expenses these costs primarily relate to the compensation of and overhead attributable to our development team  primarily due to increased personnel costs of million 
marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses increased million in to million from million in the largest contributors to this increase were medical education costs million  legal and consulting costs million  and compensation million and share based compensation expense million due to increased personnel  other contributors included corporate franchise taxes and commercial related expenses  which collectively increased by million 
included in the increased legal and consulting costs are expenses incurred related to our opposition to the attempt by the ogd regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a generic drug application to request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing for copies of vancocin  which were million in the year as compared to million the same period in we anticipate that these additional legal and consulting costs will continue at higher levels in future periods 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization is the result of the vancocin product rights acquisition in the fourth quarter of additionally  as described in our agreement with lilly  to the extent that we incur an obligation to lilly for additional payments on vancocin sales  we have contingent consideration 
we record the obligation as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related

contingent consideration and lilly related additional payments are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
intangible amortization for the years ended december  and were comparable at million and million respectively 
the comparatives are impacted by cumulative adjustments  which were million in and million in in march  as a result of ogd s change in approach relating to generic bioequivalence determinations  we reviewed the value of the intangible asset and concluded that there was no impairment of the carrying value of the intangible assets or change to the useful lives as estimated at the acquisition date 
additionally  on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of these intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
this evaluation did not result in a change in the life of the intangible assets during the year ended december  we will continue to monitor the actions of the ogd and consider the effects of our opposition efforts and the announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators and we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets  as well as estimated useful lives  at such time

income tax expense our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense includes federal  state and foreign income taxes at statutory rates and the effects of various permanent differences 
the decrease in the rate as compared to is primarily due to our current estimate of the impact of orphan drug credit for camvia as well as a million benefit for the valuation allowance adjustment primarily related to additionally deferred tax assets that management believes is more likely than not to be utilized 
we currently anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of approximately to for the year ended december   which includes an estimate related to orphan drug credit based upon estimates of qualified expenses and excludes the impact of discreet items and any potential changes in the valuation allowance 
we continue to evaluate our qualified expenses and  to the extent that actual qualified expenses vary significantly from our estimates  our effective tax rate will be impacted

additionally  we may experience fluctuations in quarterly manufacturing yields and if this occurs  we would expect the cost of product sales of vancocin to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
further  if we enter into fee for service or inventory management agreements with wholesalers in future periods  the fees would negatively impact our cost of sales expense

liquidity we expect that our near term sources of revenue will arise from vancocin product sales 
however  we cannot predict what the actual sales of vancocin will be in the future  and the outcome of our effort to oppose the ogd s approach to bioequivalence determinations for generic copies of vancocin is uncertain 
in addition  there are no assurances that demand for vancocin will continue at historical or current levels 
our ability to generate positive cash flow is also impacted by the timing of anticipated events in our cmv and hcv programs  including the scope of the clinical trials required by regulatory authorities  results from clinical trials  the results of our product development efforts  and variations from our estimate of future direct and indirect expenses 
while we anticipate that cash flows from vancocin  as well as our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  should allow us to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs for the foresable future  as well as the interest payable on the senior convertible notes  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
at december   the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our short term investments was 
overall cash flows during the year ended december   we generated million of net cash from operating activities  primarily from the cash contribution of vancocin  which includes the impact of net income 
partially offsetting this cash contribution is the impact of higher accounts receivables  which is related to the timing of orders and the price increase  which was offset by the increase in accrued expenses  deferred taxes and share based compensation expense 
we also used million of cash for investing activities  as we purchased short term investments and our corporate headquarters building 
our net cash provided 
table of contents by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily from the march issuance of senior convertible notes  net of issuance costs  in the amount of million  partially offset by million used to purchase the call spread as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
operating cash inflows we began to receive cash inflows from the sale of vancocin in january we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive material net cash inflows from our product candidates currently under development 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including the achievement of milestones and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by efforts of our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaboration partners may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  when and if approved  or they may not successfully market these products 
the most significant of our near term operating development cash inflows are as described under development programs 
operating cash outflows the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and business development efforts  general and administrative expenses  servicing our debt  and income tax payments 
bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because our product candidates are currently in the clinical stage of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
however  due to advancements in our trials  our initiative to develop non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile and our expansion into europe  we expect future costs to exceed current costs 
the most significant of our near term operating development cash outflows are as described under development programs 
development programs for each of our development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts  and preclinical and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility and other overhead costs 
additionally  for some of our development programs  we have cash inflows and outflows upon achieving certain milestones 
core development programs cmv program from the date we in licensed camvia through december   we paid million of direct costs in connection with this program  including the acquisition fee of million paid to gsk for the rights to camvia in september during  we expect camvia related activities to include continued recruitment into both the ongoing phase studies in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant and in patients who have received a liver transplant 
we will also continue to conduct phase clinical pharmacology studies to support the overall clinical development program 
based on the execution of phase clinical development studies  we expect our expenses in for the cmv program to be substantially higher than in we are solely responsible for the cost of developing our cmv product candidate 
should we achieve certain product development events  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to gsk  the licensor of camvia 
hcv program from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for compounds in this program that are currently active through december   we paid million in direct expenses for the predevelopment and development activities relating to such compounds 
these costs are net of contractual cost sharing arrangements between wyeth and us 
wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s predevelopment and development expenses 
in august  we announced a potential safety issue identified during a phase study of our hcv product candidate  hcv  dosed in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
specifically  elevated liver enzyme levels were observed in a subset of patients 
consequently  all dosing with hcv was discontinued  although patients in the phase study had the option of continuing to receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin as per standard of care 
during the remainder of  the 
table of contents planned activities for the hcv program include continuing monitoring and follow up of patients enrolled in the phase study 
in addition  there will be extensive evaluation of available preclinical and clinical safety data in order to understand the potential risks to patients and whether further clinical studies are appropriate 
no additional clinical studies with hcv will be initiated until this evaluation is complete 
the results of the investigation into liver enzyme findings observed in the phase study  along with other predevelopment activities performed during the year  will significantly impact the timing and amount of expenses we will incur related to this program in future periods 
in addition  discussions with the fda regarding our plans may impact the timing  nature and cost of future planned studies 
during we will continue to incur costs associated with discovery activities to identify a follow on back up molecule to hcv should we achieve certain additional product development events  wyeth is required to pay us certain cash milestones pursuant to terms of our collaboration agreement 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving these milestones 
vancocin and c 
difficile related we acquired vancocin in november and have spent approximately million in direct research and development costs related to vancocin or on related c 
difficile activities since acquisition 
during  we expect our research and development activities in the field of c 
difficile to increase significantly  primarily related to our rights to develop non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile for the treatment and prevention of cdi 
therefore  we expect direct costs to increase materially above levels 
direct expenses non core development programs common cold from the date that we commenced predevelopment activities for the intranasal formulation of pleconaril through december   we incurred million in direct expenses 
we have not incurred any significant direct expenses in connection with this program since  nor will we in the future  as schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
in november  we entered into a license agreement with schering plough under which schering plough has assumed responsibility for all future development and commercialization of pleconaril 
schering plough paid us an initial license fee of million in december and purchased our existing inventory of bulk drug substance for an additional million in january we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain targeted regulatory and commercial events  as well as royalties on schering plough s sales of intranasal pleconaril in the licensed territories 
business development activities through december   we paid an acquisition price of million  paid million related to additional purchase price consideration tied to product sales see note of the consolidated financial statements and incurred million of fees and expenses in connection with the vancocin acquisition 
in addition  we intend to seek to acquire additional products or product candidates 
the costs associated with evaluating or acquiring any additional product or product candidate can vary substantially based upon market size of the product  the commercial effort required for the product  the product s current stage of development  and actual and potential generic and non generic competition for the product  among other factors 
due to the variability of the cost of evaluating or acquiring business development candidates  it is not feasible to predict what our actual evaluation or acquisition costs would be  if any  however  the costs could be substantial 
debt service requirements senior convertible notes on march   the company issued million of senior convertible notes due march the senior convertible notes in a public offering 
the million includes an issuance pursuant to the underwriters exercise of an overalloment in the amount of million that was closed concurrently on march  net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes were million 
the senior convertible notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with any other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the senior convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year commencing on september  as of december   the company has accrued million in interest payable to holders of the senior convertible notes 
debt issuance costs of million have been capitalized and are being amortized 
table of contents over the term of the senior convertible notes  with the balance to be amortized as of december  being million 
the senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the senior convertible notes may only be converted i anytime after december   ii during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  iii during any calendar quarter and only during such quarter after the calendar quarter ending june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
upon conversion  holders of the senior convertible notes will receive shares of common stock  subject to viropharma s option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the senior convertible notes  and shares for any excess 
we can irrevocably elect this option at any time on or prior to the th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes may be required to be repaid on the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  as defined in the senior convertible notes 
as of december   the fair value of the million convertible senior notes outstanding was approximately million  based on the quoted market price 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior convertible notes  the company entered into privately negotiated transactions  comprised of purchased call options and warrants sold  to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the senior convertible notes 
the transactions  taken together  have the effect of increasing the initial conversion price to per share 
the net cost of the transactions was million 
the call options allow viropharma to receive up to approximately million shares of its common stock at from the call option holders  equal to the number of shares of common stock that viropharma would issue to the holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
these call options will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity dates of the related senior convertible notes or the first day all of the related senior convertible notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
concurrently  the company sold warrants to the warrant holders to receive shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants expire ratably over a day trading period beginning on june  and will be net share settled 
the purchased call options are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the senior convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of viropharma common stock at the time of exercise is greater than  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the senior convertible notes  but less than the warrant exercise price 
the warrant exercise price is higher than the price per share of of the company s stock on the pricing date 
if the market price per share of viropharma common stock at the time of conversion of any senior convertible notes is above the strike price of the purchased call options  the purchased call options will entitle the company to receive from the counterparties in the aggregate the same number of shares of our common stock as the company would be required to issue to the holder of the converted senior convertible notes 
additionally  if the market price of viropharma common stock at the time of exercise of the sold warrants exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants  the company will owe the counterparties an aggregate of approximately million shares of viropharma common stock 
if we have insufficient shares of common stock available for settlement of the warrants  we may issue shares of a newly created series of preferred stock in lieu of our obligation to deliver common stock 
any such preferred stock would be convertible into more shares of our common stock than the amount of common stock we would otherwise have been obligated to deliver under the warrants 
the purchased call options and sold warrants are separate transactions entered into by the company with the counterparties  are not part of the terms of the senior convertible notes  and will not affect the holders rights under the senior convertible notes 
holders of the senior convertible notes will not have any rights with respect to the purchased call options or the sold warrants 
the purchased call options and sold warrants meet the definition of derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

table of contents we used the net proceeds from the offering to apply to working capital and general corporate purposes 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire  license or invest in complementary businesses  technologies or products 

table of contents contractual obligations future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total year or less years years more than years operating leases senior convertible notes purchase obligations total this table does not include any milestone payments under our agreement with gsk in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
similarly  it does not include any additional payments due to lilly in connection with the vancocin acquisition  as the amount and timing of future additional payments are not determinable 
under the terms of the agreement with lilly  lilly is entitled to additional payments of of annual net sales between and million of vancocin during through no additional payments are due to lilly on net sales of vancocin below or above the net sales levels reflected above 
we account for purchase price consideration as contingent consideration and will record an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related intangible asset and a cumulative adjustment to the intangible amortization upon achievement of the related sales milestones 
assuming the maximum threshold is met at the end of each year  the cumulative amortization adjustment would be million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the event we develop any product line extensions  revive discontinued vancomycin product lines injectable or oral solution  make improvements of existing products  or expand the label to cover new indications  lilly would receive an additional royalty on net sales on these additional products for a predetermined time period 
this table does not include various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services due to the cancelable nature of the services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
operating leases represent equipment leases 
we entered into purchase obligations related to the establishment  manufacturing and decontamination of facilities used to manufacture ntcd spores 
this table does not include million for decontamination of the facility due upon termination of the manufacturing agreement due to the uncertainty of the period of payment 
this table does not include million of a non current income tax payable which represents uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment 
capital resources while we anticipate that revenues from vancocin will continue to generate positive cash flow and should allow us to fund substantially all of our ongoing development and other operating costs  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
should we need financing  we would seek to access the public or private equity or debt markets  enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into other alternative financing arrangements that may become available to us 

table of contents financing we have an effective form s universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the potential additional issuance of up to approximately million of our securities 
the registration statement provides us with the flexibility to determine the type of security we choose to sell  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities  as well as the ability to time such sales when market conditions are favorable 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
if we raise additional capital by accessing debt markets  the terms and pricing for these financings may be much more favorable to the new lenders than the terms obtained from our prior lenders 
these financings also may require liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility 
additional equity or debt financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our operating results  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce patent claims and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows product sales product revenue is recorded upon delivery to the wholesaler  when title has passed  price is determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the end of each reporting period  as part of an analysis of returns  utilizing our revenue recognition policy derived from the criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 including statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists we analyze our estimated channel inventory and we would defer recognition of revenue on product that has been delivered if we believe that channel inventory at a period end is in excess of ordinary business needs and if we believe the value of potential returns is materially different than our returns accrual 
further  in connection with our analysis of returns  if we believe channel inventory levels are increasing without a reasonably correlating increase in prescription demand  we proactively delay the processing of wholesaler orders until these levels are reduced 
for the first time since acquiring vancocin in november  during the third and fourth quarters of  we delayed orders received from customers based on the knowledge that they were ordering in excess of retail demand  as they anticipated that we would be implementing a price increase 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates  sales discounts and product returns 
these accruals are primarily based upon the history of vancocin  including both lilly and our ownership periods 
we also consider the volume and price of our products in the channel  trends in wholesaler inventory  conditions that might impact patient demand for our product such as incidence of disease and the threat of generics and other factors 
in addition to internal information  such as unit sales  we use information from external resources  which we do not verify  to estimate the channel inventory 
our external resources include prescription data reported by ims health incorporated and written and verbal information obtained from one of our three largest wholesaler customers with respect to their inventory levels 

table of contents chargebacks and rebates are the most subjective sales related accruals 
while we currently have no contracts with private third party payors  such as hmo s  we do have contractual arrangements with governmental agencies  including medicaid 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates related to these contracts in the period in which we record the sale as revenue 
these accruals are based upon historical experience of government agencies market share  governmental contractual prices  our current pricing and then current laws  regulations and interpretations 
we analyze the accrual at least quarterly and adjust the balance as needed 
we believe that if our estimates of the rate of chargebacks and rebates as a percentage of annual gross sales were incorrect by  our operating income and accruals would be impacted by approximately million in the period of correction  which we believe is immaterial 
annually  as part of our process  we performed an analysis on the share of vancocin sales that ultimately go to medicaid recipients and result in a medicaid rebate 
as part of that analysis  we considered our actual medicaid historical rebates processed  total units sold and fluctuations in channel inventory 

product returns are minimal 
product return accruals are estimated based on vancocin s history of damage and product expiration returns and are recorded in the period in which we record the sale of revenue 
at each reporting period  we also compare our returns accrual balance to the estimated channel inventory to ensure the accrual balance is reasonable and within an acceptable range 
for example  if the estimated channel inventory is at a high level  we could be required to adjust our accrual upward 
discounts are related to payment terms and are fully accrued in the period in which we record the sale of revenue 
since our customers consistently take the payment discount  we do not believe that future periods will be materially impacted by a change in a previous discount accrual 
impairment of long lived assets we review our fixed and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include  for example  projections of future cash flows and the timing and number of generic competitive entries into the market  in determining the undiscounted cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of the asset and whether an impairment exists 
these assumptions are subjective and could result in a material impact on operating results in the period of impairment 
while we reviewed our intangible assets in march in light of the actions taken by the ogd  we did not recognize any impairment charges 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we will continue to monitor the actions of the ogd and consider the effects of our opposition actions and the announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators and we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets at such time 
on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
while we reviewed the useful life of our intangible assets in march in light of the actions taken by the ogd  we did not change the useful life of our intangible assets during the year ended december  see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information 
short term investments we review our short term investments on a periodic basis for other than temporary impairments 
this review considers credit worthiness and our intent and ability to hold debt securities until maturity and is subjective as it requires management to evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred in that period that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
as of december   no unrealized losses are other than temporary 
share based employee compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r effective january  the calculation of this expense includes judgment related to the period of time used in calculating the volatility of our common stock  the amount of forfeitures and an estimate of the exercising habits of our employees  which is also influenced by our insider trading policy 
changes in the volatility of our common stock or the habits of our employees could result in variability in the fair value of awards granted 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on expected pre tax earnings  existing statutory tax rates  limitations on the use of tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards and tax planning opportunities available in 
table of contents the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  tax planning strategies and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
we recognize the benefit of tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if such tax position is more likely than not of being sustained 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact the income tax position in the year of resolution 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets  which included the effects of federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of million  convertible debt of million  capitalized research and development costs of million and other items of million 
these assets are offset by a million valuation allowance as our ability to estimate long term future taxable income with a high level of certainty is limited due to uncertainty surrounding generic competition for vancocin 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences becomes deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and future taxable income  the utilization of the carryforwards and other factors 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
should we further reduce the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets  a current year tax benefit will be recognized and future periods would then include income taxes at a higher rate than the effective rate in the period that the adjustment is made 
as our business evolves  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are primarily comprised of a mix of us corporate debt  government securities and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
our primary investment objective is the preservation of principal  while at the same time maximizing the generation of investment income 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in cash equivalents such as treasury bills and money market funds and fixed income securities such as us government and agency securities  municipal securities  taxable municipals  and corporate notes while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
historically  we have typically invested in financial instruments with maturities of less than one year 
the carrying amount  which approximates fair value  and the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate of our investment portfolio at december   was approximately million and  respectively 
a one percent change in the interest rate would have resulted in a million impact to interest income for the year ended december  at february   we had outstanding million of our senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year commencing on september  the senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the senior convertible notes may only be converted i anytime after december   ii during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  iii during any calendar quarter and only during such quarter after the calendar quarter ending june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate events

the senior convertible notes may be required to be repaid on the occurrence of certain fundamental 
table of contents changes  as defined in the senior convertible notes 
as of december   the fair value of the million convertible senior notes outstanding was approximately million  based on the quoted market price in connection with the issuance of the senior convertible senior notes  we have entered into privately negotiated transactions with two counterparties the counterparties  comprised of purchased call options and warrants sold 
these transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential equity dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the senior convertible notes 
these transactions expose the company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance 
the company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards  and diversification of counterparties 
beginning in  we also have been exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  specifically the euro  for certain immaterial expenses 
we have used foreign currency forward exchange contracts based on forecasted transactions to reduce this exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash outflows  resulting from purchases from foreign testing sites  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the nominal amount of these forwards as of december  was million and the associated fair value was approximately  which is credited to research and development expenses
