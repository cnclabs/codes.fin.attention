ebitda  a measure used by management to measure performance  is defined as income loss from continuing operations  plus interest expense  net of interest income  income tax expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and amortization of coal supply agreements 
our management believes ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management s discretionary use  as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
the amounts shown for ebitda as presented herein differ from the amounts calculated under the definition of ebitda used in our debt instruments 
the definition of ebitda used in our debt instruments is further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources covenant compliance 
ebitda is calculated and reconciled to income loss from continuing operations in the table below 
successor predecessor twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  for the period from february  date of formation through december  seven months ended july  twelve months ended december  in thousands income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income income tax benefit expense depreciation  depletion and amortization amortization of coal supply agreements ebitda

the amount for the successor in includes the mark to market gain on interest rate swaps not yet designated as cash flow hedges prior to december  in  the amount includes the mark to market loss for the period during which the swaps did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
see note above 
b represents the portion of pension  other postretirement and black lung expense resulting from amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses  prior service costs and transition obligations 
c represents incremental cost of sales recorded in the period arising from the preliminary estimate of profit added to inventory in purchase accounting 
d in purchase accounting  the fair value of partially and fully uncovered coal included consideration of the effort spent prior to the purchase date to remove overburden and get the coal to its partially or fully uncovered state 
therefore  the fair value assigned to partially and fully uncovered coal reserves was higher than that assigned to other coal reserves 
depletion of coal reserves  including the incremental fair value related to pre acquisition overburden removal efforts is included in depreciation  depletion and amortization 
subsequent to the acquisition date and prior to the implementation of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry on january   the cost associated with removal of overburden to uncover coal reserves was deferred until the related coal is mined and charged to cost of coal sales when the coal is sold 
all partially and fully uncovered coal valued at the acquisition date was sold by december  for the twelve months ended december  and for the period from february  date of formation through december   depreciation  depletion and amortization included the value of overburden removal performed prior to the acquisition date  which would have been included in cost of coal sales if incurred subsequent to the acquisition date 
e represents compensation expense attributable to stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awarded to certain directors

c represents the cost of a long term incentive plan instituted by the predecessor in that was terminated prior to closing as required by the change in control provisions in the plan agreement 
we have implemented a management equity program that will not result in a cash cost to us 
d in  amount represents a million bonus paid to senior management related to the ipo and a million sponsor monitoring fee recorded by the successor 
this latter item was terminated in connection with the ipo 
in  amount represents a loss of longwall shields at the emerald mine due to geological conditions 
represents the estimated impact on ebitda of the temporary idling of our cumberland mine in the first half of as a result of a revised interpretation of mine ventilation laws by msha 
for purposes of this computation  earnings consist of pre tax income from continuing operations excluding minority interest and equity in earnings of affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense on all indebtedness plus amortization of deferred costs of financing and the interest component of lease rental expense 
earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by the deficiency of million for the seven months ended july  
table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are the fourth largest coal producer in the united states  operating eight mining complexes that consist of thirteen individual coal mines 
our mining operations are located in southwest pennsylvania  southern west virginia and the southern powder river basin region of wyoming 
four of our operations are surface mines  two of our operations are underground mines using highly efficient longwall mining technology and the remaining seven operations are underground mines that utilize continuous miners 
in addition to mining coal  we also purchase coal from other producers and utilize it with our own production in coal brokering and trading activities 
our primary product is steam coal  sold primarily to electric power generators located in the united states 
approximately and of our and coal sales revenues  respectively  were derived from the sale of metallurgical coal to the domestic and export metallurgical coal markets where it is used to make coke for steel production 
while the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of coal  we also realize revenues from coal production royalties  override royalty payments from a coal supply agreement now fulfilled by another producer  fees from the processing of our production by a synfuel facility  fees to transload coal through our rivereagle facility on the big sandy river and revenues from the sale of coalbed methane  dry systems technologies equipment and filters and natural gas 
from july  through july   we were known as rag american coal holding  inc and were a stand alone wholly owned subsidiary of rag coal international ag rag headquartered in essen  germany 
in october  rag announced its intention to divest its international mining subsidiaries 
in addition to rag american coal holding  inc  these international mining subsidiaries consisted of operations in australia and venezuela 
on february   rag announced the sale of four of our subsidiaries  collectively known as the rag colorado business unit  to a third party 
the subsidiaries comprising the rag colorado business unit owned an underground longwall mine located in routt county  colorado  an idled underground longwall mine located in moffat county  colorado and surface lands located in northwest colorado and southern wyoming 
the transaction closed on april  in the financial statements of the predecessor for the period from january  through july   the rag colorado business unit is classified as a discontinued operation 
on may   rag entered into a definitive agreement with foundation coal corporation to sell all of its remaining operations 
accordingly  foundation coal holdings  inc the company and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary  foundation coal corporation fcc  began operations on july  by acquiring all of the us coal mining operations of rag american coal holding  inc the acquisition  then owned by first reserve fund ix  lp first reserve  blackstone fch capital partners iv lp blackstone  blackstone family investment partnership iv  american metals and coal international acquisition  llc collectively  the sponsors and senior management of the company 
in december    shares of the company s common stock were sold in an initial public offering and partial exercise of the overallotment shares 
these transactions in combination with a stock dividend of  common shares distributed to the pre ipo shareholders in january  reduced the company ownership by the sponsors and management to approximately 
on september   the company completed a secondary offering and partial exercise of the overallotment shares in which the sponsors sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
this transaction reduced the ownership of the company by the sponsors and management to approximately 
on january    shares of common stock of the company were distributed by affiliates of blackstone to blackstone s limited and other partners and  shares of the company s common stock were

depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization includes depreciation of plant and equipment  cost depletion of amounts assigned to owned and leased mineral rights  amortization of mine development costs  internal use software and leasehold improvements 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to increased cost depletion and higher depreciation and amortization 
cost depletion increased by million due to increased production period over period 
depreciation and amortization increased by million in the twelve months of mainly due to capital additions to plant and equipment during the twelve months ended december  and the depreciation of the recently placed in service erp software  which began depreciation at the beginning of the second quarter of also contributing to higher depreciation expense in the twelve months ended december  was the completion of an overland conveyor belt that was placed into service in the third quarter of at the powder river basin 
coal supply agreement amortization 
application of purchase accounting in resulted in the recognition of a significant liability for below market priced coal supply agreements as well as a significant asset for above market priced coal supply agreements  both in relation to market prices at the date of acquisition of mining assets by the company in coal supply agreement amortization decreased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  amortization of the liability for below market priced coal supply agreements during the twelve months ended december  was million of credit to expense compared to million of credit to expense in the comparable period of the prior year 
amortization of the asset for above market priced coal supply agreements during the twelve months ended december  was million of expense compared to million of expense in the comparable period of the prior year 
as shipments on coal supply agreements valued in purchase accounting are completed  the period over period impact of the amortization on both the asset and liability balances will continue to diminish until approximately when shipments associated with these coal supply agreements are estimated to be complete

covenant compliance our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  foundation coal corporation is required to comply with certain financial covenants which are considered material terms of the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing fcc s outstanding senior notes 
information about the financial covenants is material to an investor s understanding of fcc s financial condition and liquidity 
the breach of covenants in the senior secured credit facility that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda  as defined below  could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indenture 
additionally  under the senior secured credit facility and indenture  fcc s ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
covenants and required levels as defined by the senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the outstanding senior notes are period ended december  covenant levels january  to december  covenant levels january  and thereafter covenant levels senior secured credit facility minimum adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio x x x maximum total debt less unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda ratio x x x indenture minimum adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio required to incur additional debt pursuant to ratio provisions x x x the senior secured credit facility requires fcc to maintain an adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio at a minimum of x and a total debt less unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda ratio starting at a maximum of x in each case for the most recent twelve month period 
failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default by fcc under the senior secured credit facility 
if lenders under the senior secured credit facility fail to waive any such default  repayment obligations under the senior secured credit facility could be accelerated  which would also constitute a default under the indenture 
covenants reflect the definition and levels required by the july  amended and restated senior secured credit facility 
the ability for fcc to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our indenture  subject to specified exceptions  is tied to an adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio of at least to adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude non recurring items  non cash items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indenture and the senior secured credit facility 
ebitda  a measure used by management to evaluate its ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes  is defined as net income loss from operations plus interest expense  net of interest 
table of contents income  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and charges for early extinguishment of debt 
ebitda is not a financial measure recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the amounts shown for ebitda as presented  may differ from amounts calculated and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
as of december   fcc was in compliance with all required financial covenants of the senior secured credit facility 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our significant future contractual obligations by year as of december  after total unaudited  in thousands long term debt estimated cash interest on long term debt estimated cash payments for asset retirement obligations unconditional purchase commitments operating leases total the variable interest rate on debt is  reflecting a libor estimate based on the month swap rate as of december   plus a margin of 
we expect to use cash flows provided by operating activities to invest in the range of million to million in capital expenditures during calendar year of which million to million is to maintain production and replace mining equipment 
the additional million is expected to be directed toward improvements in productivity and selective expansions of production 
approximately million of the capital expenditures are included in unconditional purchase commitments shown above 
the remaining unconditional purchase commitments consist of million for purchased coal in normal quantities for delivery to customers and million pertaining to forward contracts to purchase explosives in normal quantities for use at our surface mines 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit retirement plans and to pay approximately million of retiree health care benefits  gross of medicare part d subsidies  in calendar year we also expect to incur approximately million per year for surety bond premiums and letters of credit fees 
we believe that cash balances plus cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet these obligations plus fund requirements for working capital and capital expenditures without incurring additional borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees  indemnifications and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  the underlying obligations that they secure  such as asset retirement obligations  self insured workers compensation liabilities  royalty obligations and certain retiree medical obligations  are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post mining reclamation required by our mining permits  pay our federal production royalties  pay workers compensation claims under self insured workers compensation laws in various states  pay federal black lung benefits  pay retiree health care benefits to certain retired umwa employees and perform certain other obligations 
in order to provide the required financial assurance  we generally use surety bonds for post mining reclamation and royalty payment obligations and bank letters of credit for self insured workers compensation obligations and umwa retiree health care obligations 
federal black lung benefits are paid from a dedicated trust fund that has sufficient assets to fund these obligations for the next several years 
bank letters of credit are also used to collateralize a portion of the surety bonds 
we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of million as of december   of which million secured reclamation obligations  million secured coal lease obligations  million secured self insured workers compensation obligations  and million for other miscellaneous obligations 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit in place for the following purposes million for workers compensation  including collateral for workers compensation bonds  million for umwa retiree health care obligations  million for collateral for reclamation surety bonds  and million for other miscellaneous obligations 
in the last few years  the market terms under which surety bonds can be obtained have generally become less favorable to all mining companies 
in the event that additional surety bonds become unavailable  we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
wage negotiations with the umwa and idling of the company s illinois basin mining operation wage agreements between three affiliates of the company and the umwa expired on or shortly after march  specifically  the wage agreement for wabash expired at pm on march  and the umwa wage agreements with cumberland coal resources  lp cumberland and emerald coal resources  lp emerald expired at pm on april  negotiations between these respective subsidiaries and the umwa commenced in early january of but intensified in late march of and continued through april  emerald coal resources  lp and cumberland coal resources  lp reiterated their willingness to sign the national bituminous coal operators association bcoa umwa wage agreement 
wabash would not sign the bcoa agreement 
the hourly workforce continued to work without a formal agreement of the parties under the terms of the expired wage agreement until am on april  at which time  alleging unfair labor practices by wabash  emerald and cumberland  the umwa represented hourly workforces strike the wabash  emerald and cumberland mines 
subsequent to the commencement of a umwa strike on april   wabash announced the idling of the mine in southern illinois 
the mine had become economically unviable at that time as a result of a combination of factors  including aged infrastructure  softening market conditions and the prospect of a new higher cost labor contract with the umwa 
on april   negotiations between the umwa and the three subsidiaries resumed 
in the early evening of april   it was announced that the umwa and the three subsidiaries had reached agreement and that the workforces at emerald and cumberland would return to work 
wabash remained idled and the effects of the idling had been negotiated with the umwa 
the collective bargaining agreements with the umwa at cumberland and emerald expire at the end of the fourth quarter of during the twelve months ended december   as a result of the wabash mine idling  the company recognized employee termination costs of million and million in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and the provisions of sfas no 
 respectively 
termination costs resulting from one time benefit arrangements include medical insurance continuance costs and severance to salaried employees 
during the twelve months ended december   the company also recognized million of other direct and incremental costs related to additional benefit claims for certain severed employees 
these employee termination costs are recorded as employee and contract termination costs and other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents at march   wabash was the seller under two coal supply agreements supplied from the mine with duke energy indiana  inc wabash continued to ship coal under the coal supply agreements through april   just prior to the mine idling 
each agreement contained force majeure language excusing the seller from supplying coal in the event of a work stoppage 
on april   wabash and duke energy indiana  inc executed a termination agreement and mutual release buying out  subject to certain conditions  all obligations under their two contracts in exchange for a cash settlement that the company paid on april  the company believes there will be no further obligations of wabash under these two contracts 
during the twelve months ended december   the company recognized million of net contract termination costs in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
these contract termination costs are recorded as employee and contract termination costs and other in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the twelve months ended december  certain trends and uncertainties our long term outlook for the coal markets in the united states remains positive 
the energy information administration in its annual energy outlook forecasts that coal fired electrical generation will increase by an average annual growth rate of through through november  electric power generation from coal is estimated to have increased from the comparable period of strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the us is being driven by various factors such as the growing economy  increasing population  public demands for low electricity costs  relatively high prices for the alternative fossil fuels of gas and oil for electricity generation  the inability for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to become the base load source of electric power  geopolitical risks for continuing to import large quantities of global oil and natural gas resources  and the relatively abundant steam coal reserves located within the united states 
according to the us department of energy  national energy technology laboratory  tracking new coal fired power plants  dated october   there are approximately  megawatts of new coal fired electrical generation under construction in the united states 
there is an additional approximately  megawatts of new coal fired electrical generating capacity permitted and expected to be constructed 
this new capacity will increase the annual coal consumption for electrical generation by an estimated eighty million tons  much of which is expected to be supplied from the powder river basin in wyoming 
approximately  megawatts of additional coal fired electrical generation has been announced and is in the early stages of permitting and development 
during coal exports from the united states increased significantly in response to strong worldwide demand for coal 
the largest increases in international coal demand are from the rapidly growing and industrializing economies of china and india 
in the last two years  china has evolved from a net exporter to a net importer of coal 
due partly to infrastructure constraints in australia and south africa  the seaborne coal trade has struggled to keep up with these increases in demand 
seaborne coal shipments traditionally destined for europe and south america have been diverted to asia creating opportunities to increase exports from the united states  particularly into europe 
coal export volumes increased approximately in compared to export volumes for are forecast to increase by at least an additional to levels last seen in the early s 
the surge in demand for exports  combined with recent weather related coal production outages in queensland  australia and south africa as well as the harshest chinese winter in the last fifty years  has increased prompt prices for metallurgical and steam coals produced in the eastern united states by an estimated and  respectively  since the beginning of the actual and anticipated increases in coal exports have also tightened fundamentals in the domestic steam and metallurgical coal markets leading to increased market activity and prices in all regions 
according to the world energy outlook weo  global primary energy demand grows by more than half over the next quarter of a century  with coal rising most in absolute terms and fossil fuel accounting for most of the increase between now and china and india have contributed more than half the increase in global 
table of contents demand for energy  and over for coal  since the weo estimates these two growing economies will contribute more than of the increase in global energy demand through china and india account for of the growth of coal use in power generation 
the weo has a general conclusion that dependence on coal for power rises strongly in emerging economies  while it stagnates in the more developed nations 
ultimately  the global demand for and use of coal may be limited by any global treaties which place restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions 
as part of the united nations framework convention on climate change  representatives from nations met in bali  indonesia in december to discuss a program to limit greenhouse gas emissions after the united states participated in the conference 
the convention adopted what is called the bali action plan 
the bali action plan contains no binding commitments  but concludes that deep cuts in global emissions will be required and provides a timetable for two years of talks to shape the first formal addendum to the united nations framework convention on climate change treaty since the kyoto protocol 
the ultimate outcome of the bali action plan  and any treaty or other arrangement ultimately adopted by the united states or other countries  may have a material adverse impact on the global supply and demand for coal 
this is particularly true if cost effective technology for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide is not sufficiently developed 
proposed coal fired electric generating facilities that do not include technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide are facing increasing opposition from environmental groups as well as state and local governments who are concerned with global climate change and uncertain financial impacts of potential greenhouse gas regulations 
coal fired generating plants incorporating carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies are more expensive to build than conventional pulverized coal generating plants and the technologies are still in the developmental stages 
this dynamic may cause power generating companies to cut back on plans to build coal fired plants in favor of alternative forms of baseload electrical generation in the near term 
nevertheless  the level of interest in new coal fired generating facilities remains strong 
in combination with heightened interest in coal gasification and coal liquefaction  this level of interest is a potential indicator of increasing demand for coal in the united states 
based on weekly production reporting through december  from the national mining association  appalachian production trails the comparable period of by approximately partially as a result of capacity idling due to weak market conditions prevailing in most of coal producers in northern appalachia and the powder river basin continue to report deferrals of previously announced mine expansion projects 
through december   western coal production has declined approximately from the comparable period of the prior year 
judicial decisions in central appalachia with respect to permits to construct valley fills at surface mines are likely to slow the process of obtaining surface mining permits in that region with resultant uncertainties for producers 
in addition  implementation of the mine improvement and new emergency response act of and new state mine safety statutes has placed increased regulatory burdens on the coal industry with resultant cost increases and production constraints 
the combination of strong demand for coal fired electric power and production declines and uncertainties  particularly in central appalachia  has led to forecasts of declines in stockpiles at coal fired electric generating plants over the next year 
for reasons described above  spot market prices for central appalachian and powder river basin coals increased by and  respectively  as of january   compared to the same date one year earlier 
long term  the delicate balance of coal supply and increasing coal demand is expected to result in strong  but volatile  fundamentals for the us coal industry 
our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the current pricing environment for us steam coal production is strong in relation to historical pricing levels  and has strengthened  notably in the past several weeks  in comparison to pricing levels prevailing in the first three quarters of prices for high quality metallurgical coal  used to manufacture coke for steelmaking  have remained strong in response to increased worldwide demand for steel and production and transportation constraints in exporting metallurgical coal from australia 
as of january   we have committed and priced and respectively  of our planned shipment ranges for and in the longer term  decreases in coal prices due to  among other 
table of contents reasons  the supply of domestic and foreign coal  the demand for electricity and the price and availability of alternative fuels for electricity generation could affect our revenues and our ability to generate cash flows 
in addition  our results of operations depend on the cost of coal production 
we continue to experience increased operating costs for fuel and explosives  steel products  tires  health care  wages  salaries  contract coal haulage services and contract labor 
we may also experience difficult geologic conditions  delays in obtaining permits  labor shortages  unforeseen equipment problems and shortages of critical materials such as tires and explosives that may limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels 
to the extent upward pressure on costs exceed our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
see the special note regarding forward looking statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional considerations regarding our outlook 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of all significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal smcra and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines and sealing portals at deep mines 
reclamation activities that are performed outside of the normal mining process are accounted for as asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates and assumptions regarding productivity 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based on historical or third party costs  both of which are stated at fair value 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine the fair value of our asset retirement obligations 
in order to determine fair value  we must also estimate a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed below discount rate sfas no 
requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded at fair value 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin sfas no 
requires the measurement of an obligation to be based on the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of performing these activities with internal resources 
this margin was estimated based upon discussion with contractors that perform reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is settled 

table of contents on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revision to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  in each case to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately million at december  payable through employee benefit plans we have two non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering certain of our salaried and non union hourly employees 
we also have an unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan covering certain of our senior level salaried employees 
benefits are based on either the employee s compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us 
funding of these plans is in accordance with the requirements of the erisa  which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we contributed million and million  respectively  into the plans 
we account for our defined benefit retirement plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 
which requires amounts recognized in the financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
for the twelve months ended december   and  we recorded pension expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the calculation of the net periodic benefits costs pension expense and projected benefit obligation associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
we establish the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets 
the pension plan s investment targets are equity private equity  fixed income  other and real estate mutual funds 
investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines 
the long term rate of return assumption used to determine periodic pension expense was  and for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods 
the discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected  accumulated and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension cost 
in estimating that rate  sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  requires rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was  and for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
actuarial liabilities related to our defined benefit plans were remeasured as of april  in connection with the idling of the wabash mine 
the discount rate was increased to at that time 
the discount rate was increased to at the december  measurement date 
the differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates and returns on plan assets are amortized into pension expense over the remaining average service life of the active plan participants 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the 
table of contents twelve months ended december  by approximately million and decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be approximately a million increase in the net periodic pension cost and approximately a million increase in the projected benefit obligation 
we also currently provide certain postretirement medical and life insurance coverage for eligible employees 
these obligations are unfunded 
covered employees who terminate employment after meeting eligibility requirements are eligible for postretirement coverage for themselves and their dependents 
postretirement medical and life plans for salaried employees and non represented hourly employees are contributory  with retiree contributions adjusted annually  and contain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the postretirement medical plan for members of the umwa is not contributory 
we account for our other postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
which requires amounts recognized in the financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
for the twelve months ended december   and  we recorded postretirement benefit expense of million  million and million  respectively 
various actuarial assumptions are required to determine the amounts reported as obligations and costs related to the postretirement benefit plan 
the differences resulting from actual experience versus actuarial assumptions are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and amortized into expense in future periods 
these assumptions include the discount rate and the future medical cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments and is calculated in the same manner as discussed above for the defined benefit retirement plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the postretirement benefit expense was  and for the twelve months ended december   december  and december   respectively 
actuarial liabilities related to our postretirement benefit plans were remeasured as of april  in connection with the idling of the wabash mine 
the discount rate was increased to at that time 
the discount rate was increased to at the december  measurement date 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the postretirement benefit expense for the twelve months ended december  by approximately million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be approximately a million increase in the postretirement benefit expense and approximately a million increase in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
the future health care cost trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are expected to increase over the life of the plan 
the health care cost trend rate assumptions are determined primarily based upon our historical rate of change in retiree health care costs 
we have implemented many effective retiree health care cost containment measures that have resulted in actual increases in our retiree health care costs to fall far below the double digit annual increases experienced by many companies and cited in most external studies 
the postretirement expense for the twelve months ended december   and was based on an assumed initial health care inflationary rate of for all years  decreasing to in  and  respectively  which represents the ultimate health care cost trend rate for the remainder of the plan life 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the twelve months ended december  by million and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed ultimate health care cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the twelve months ended december  by million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from alternative minimum tax amt credits and a valuation allowance to reduce the value of our net deferred tax asset to an amt tax rate 
we believe that we will continue to be an amt tax payer indefinitely 
if future taxable income is different than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
mineral rights there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable mineral reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable mineral reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff and independent third party consultants 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological and mining conditions  historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  competing property rights such as surface rights  oil and gas rights  deeper or shallower coal rights and easements  ability to permit specific reserves for a particular type of mining  future operating  development and reclamation costs  and technology improvements 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves may materially vary from estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of long term coal supply agreements rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
as of january   we had sales commitments for 
table of contents approximately of our planned shipments 
as of january   uncommitted and unpriced tonnage was  and of planned shipments in  and  respectively 
credit risk our credit risk is primarily with electric power generators and  to a lesser extent  steel producers 
most electric power generators to whom we sell have investment grade credit ratings 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable against established credit limits 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay 
interest rate risk our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates through our bank term loan and our revolving credit facility 
to achieve risk mitigation objectives  we have in the past managed our interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate on the outstanding principal of our senior secured credit facility was as of december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates during would have increased interest expense by million 
as we continue to monitor the interest rate environment in concert with our risk mitigation objectives  consideration is being given to future interest rate risk reduction strategies
