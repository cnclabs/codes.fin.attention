item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition internal controls over financial reporting  and item a t controls and procedures management s report on internal controls over financial reporting 
if we are not able to remediate our existing internal control deficiencies  we may not have adequate  accurate or timely financial information and our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective 
further  material errors in our consolidated financial statements may go undetected and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations or comply with the requirements of the sec  which may subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec 
if this occurs  there could be an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
in addition to continuing to remedy the significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting  we need to bring our financial reporting procedures up to public company standards so as to allow management to report on  and  when required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our independent registered public accountants to attest to  our internal controls over financial reporting 
as a result  we will continue to incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time in this area 
we will be required to incur additional costs in documenting  evaluating  testing and remediating our internal control procedures and systems  including the hiring of consultants or additional personnel 
such actions  while necessary and beneficial  will adversely affect our financial results 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel  or our failure to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  could cause a disruption in our relationships with digital entertainment services and content owners 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel 
although we have employment agreements with our executive officers  they may decide to terminate their employment or otherwise cease to be employed by us 
we do not have key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
as we grow  our business will be dependent on our ability to recruit  employ and retain additional management and skilled personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract other key personnel could disrupt and limit our ability to grow our business 
if the internet and portable digital music and video players and mobile phones cease to be the medium accepted by the mass market for digital music and video content  our business could be affected adversely 
our success depends to a substantial extent on the willingness of consumers to increase their use of digital entertainment services as a method of purchasing music and video content or viewing ad supported content 
the use of the internet  wireless  cable and mobile networks to select and download purchased music and video content is growing rapidly but is still evolving  and offering ad supported video content is in its infancy 
it is uncertain whether these markets will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
if the use of the internet  wireless  cable and mobile networks to select and purchase music and video content or view ad supported content does not gain in popularity and market acceptance  our business could be adversely affected 
much of our revenue is currently tied to the popularity of portable digital music players like the ipod by apple inc and other digital music listening and video viewing devices  including mobile phones 
if the market penetration by these devices does not 
table of contents continue to grow  the number of consumers purchasing digital music and video content may decrease or not grow  which could result in a reduction in our revenue 
the digital music industry is evolving and we are vulnerable to discounting  price reductions  pricing structure and stocking changes that may evolve in the industry and  as a result  cause a reduction in our revenue 
we receive revenue based on the wholesale prices determined by the digital music retailers based  to a large extent  on the price they charge to consumers 
we have limited ability to influence the pricing models of the digital entertainment services 
while the major record labels were unsuccessful in their recent attempt to change the pricing structure  there is no assurance that they will not attempt to change the pricing structure in the future or that the digital music retailers will not initiate such a change that could result in lower pricing or tiered pricing that could reduce the amount of revenue we receive 
in addition  the popularity of digital music retailers that offer digital music through subscription and other pricing models is increasing 
for example  emusic which is controlled by our majority shareholder  a subscription based music service  is now the second largest digital music retailer in the world 
currently  the revenue we earn per individual music recording is generally less under these subscription models than what we receive from itunes  although we expect it will increase as more subscribers are added 
additionally  digital music services at present generally accept all the music content that we and other distributors deliver to them 
however  to the extent the digital music services limit the types or amount of music recordings they will accept from content owners and distributors like us  or substantially limit the number of music recordings they will post for sale  or change their current stocking plans  for instance by removing music recordings that do not meet minimum sales thresholds or other criteria  our revenue could be significantly reduced 
piracy is likely to continue to negatively impact our potential revenue 
our revenue comes from the sale of our digital content over internet  wireless  cable and mobile networks  which is subject to unauthorized consumer copying and widespread dissemination on the internet without an economic return to us 
global piracy is a significant threat to the entertainment industry generally and to us 
unauthorized copies and piracy have contributed to the decrease in the volume of legitimate sales of music and video content and have put pressure on the price of legitimate sales 
because of our limited experience in the acquisition  processing and distribution of digital video content  we may not be able to earn an adequate return on our video content 
our distribution approach may not work well for video content 
the approach we have taken to date in acquiring  processing and marketing music content may not work as well for video content 
the distribution of digital video content through digital entertainment services is a relatively new extension of the digital entertainment marketplace 
while we have entered into a variety of video distribution agreements and have distributed video content to the major video retailers  the resulting revenues have been limited 
if we are unable to enter into additional video distribution agreements on commercially favorable terms  this could limit our future revenue 
additionally  some of our existing agreements with certain digital entertainment services are based on sharing advertising revenue associated with the video content it will make available through such partners 
advertising supported revenue models associated with the distribution of video content are evolving  with many of our partners still in the test marketing phase of developing their video distribution services 
there can be no assurances as to the potential revenue that the combined company may generate under these models 
our success depends on consumer demand for our content 
in addition  our success in digitally distributing video content depends on the market demand for digital video recordings and our ability to acquire and offer for purchase or advertising supported viewing  video content that appeals to consumers tastes and preferences 
consumers tastes are subject to frequent  significant and sometimes unpredictable changes 
we cannot accurately assess or control consumer demand for our digital video content 
digital video distribution is in its infancy and technical requirements are evolving 
the process for digitally encoding video content and packaging it for delivery to meet the technical requirements of our digital entertainment service partners is more complex and time consuming than processing music content 
the technical requirements continue to evolve and we may encounter unexpected difficulties in 
table of contents adapting our processes or in meeting the technical requirements of the digital entertainment services as they continue to be refined 
if this is the case  we may have to make significant investments in our technology and operating cost structure to meet evolving technical requirements 
any delay in processing and delivering video content to the digital entertainment services may cause delays in expected revenue growth and any significant changes to current processing requirements could increase our costs and delay or impede our ability to achieve a profit from the distribution of video content 
additionally  based on our experience to date  a number of digital entertainment services providers have initially limited the amount and type of video content they will accept based on their capacity constraints and or content selection criteria 
if digital entertainment services continue to limit the types or amount of video content they will accept and we are unable to exploit all of the video content we have under contract  our revenue potential could be limited 
if the music content we provide to digital entertainment services does not appeal to consumers tastes and preferences  our revenue will decrease 
our success depends on our ability to acquire or license digital rights and offer to consumers  digital music content that appeals to consumers tastes and preferences 
consumers tastes are subject to frequent  significant and sometimes unpredictable changes 
we cannot accurately assess or control consumer demand for our music content 
our historical revenue is based on the number of music recordings available for purchase at digital entertainment services  which remained relatively small in numbers until late seasonality and other trends in consumer demand for music have been difficult to assess from this limited historical data 
in the future  our current music content and the additional music content we make available to consumers may not experience similar demand 
any reduction in the popularity of our music content with consumers will cause a reduction in our revenue 
our business involves identifying and locating the holders of digital rights to additional music and video content  and failure to do so will limit our revenue growth 
our ability to continue to increase our revenue depends on our ability to continue to acquire digital rights to music and video content 
ownership of music and video content is highly fragmented and not organized in a common marketplace 
there is no central registry or directory of content owners and finding them can be difficult and time consuming 
we currently rely on our business development personnel  on networks of relationships and on market research to locate content owners  as well as our reputation in the industry and targeted advertising to attract content owners seeking to access the digital market 
in the future  our ability to continue to identify  locate and attract such content owners will have a significant impact on the amount of content we are able to acquire 
our inability to enter into agreements to acquire additional digital rights to music and video content on commercially favorable terms could impede our growth and increase our expenses 
the growth of our business is dependent  in large part  on our ability to acquire or license digital rights to additional music and video content 
even if we are able to locate additional content owners  they may not be willing to sell or license their digital rights or we may not be able to negotiate terms that are commercially favorable to us particularly given the competitive environment of our industry 
while we believe that our experience and knowledge in the music industry allows us to determine commercially reasonable prices for music and video content  we may be unable to objectively determine fair market value for the digital rights to the content that we acquire because of unknown consumer demand for such content  unknown number of additional owners of digital rights to such content in certain cases and absence of independent valuations for music and video content 
if content owners are unwilling to sell or license their rights on terms that we have determined are commercially favorable to us  we will not be able to substantially increase our revenue 
we face competition from companies seeking to acquire the digital rights to music and video content  which could negatively impact our ability to acquire additional digital rights 
the market for acquiring digital rights from content owners is competitive  especially for the distribution of music catalogs owned by independent labels 
the number of commercialized music and video recordings available for acquisition is large  but limited  and many of the more desirable music recordings are already subject to digital distribution agreements or have been directly placed with digital entertainment services 
we face competition in our pursuit to acquire additional music and video content  which may limit the amount of available music and video content for sale or license and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
our competitors may from time to time offer 
table of contents better terms of acquisition to content owners 
subsidiaries of the four major record labels  which have always aggressively competed to provide physical distribution for independent labels  have become increasingly active in the digital market segment 
these companies have the ability to offer the consolidation of both physical and digital distribution through a major record label  can offer reduced physical distribution fees in order to gain the digital distribution rights from independent labels and other content owners and can condition an agreement to distribute physical content on the inclusion of digital rights  while we are focused only on the digital distribution of music and video content 
some of our competitors have adopted  and may continue to adopt  aggressive pricing policies and devote substantial resources to acquiring digital rights to music and video recordings 
in addition  our competitors may form strategic alliances with record labels and digital entertainment services that could result in increased competition for the acquisition of music recordings  service offerings or favorable terms with the digital entertainment services 
increased competition for the acquisition of digital rights to music and video recordings may result in a reduction in our operating margins  market share and brand 
we are substantially dependent on a limited number of digital entertainment services  in particular itunes  for the sale of our content 
we derive our revenue from a small number of leading digital entertainment services that make our content available to consumers 
we generally deliver our music and video content to these digital entertainment services in priority of their significance to us 
for the years ended december  and  we received and of our revenue from itunes  respectively 
for the same periods  we received and of our revenue from emusic which is controlled by our majority shareholder  respectively 
our agreements with itunes have terms of three years  some of which end in december  some in october  and some in april if we are not able to continue to renew our relationships with itunes and other digital entertainment services that make our music and video content available to consumers on similar economic terms  our ability to generate revenue will be significantly reduced 
our accounts receivable are concentrated with a limited number of digital entertainment services  particularly itunes  which subjects us to substantial payment risk 
we rely on reports from digital entertainment services detailing download and other activity to determine our revenue  and such reports are typically provided to us within to days following the end of the reporting period  generally monthly 
we receive payment at approximately the same time as we receive these detailed revenue reports 
our accounts receivable therefore consists of approximately one month s revenue or one quarter in the case of certain digital entertainment services that report quarterly 
as of december   accounts receivable from itunes represented of total accounts receivable  compared to of total accounts receivable as of december   and accounts receivable from emusic which is controlled by our majority shareholder  represented and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
the concentration of our accounts receivable among a small number of digital entertainment services is likely to continue and we expect our accounts receivable to become larger as we grow 
we had a  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of december  however  if any significant digital entertainment services are unable to pay us as due each month or quarter  as the case may be  it could disrupt our business and cause us to report a bad debt loss in excess of amounts provided for potential doubtful accounts 
we have entered into multi year agreements for digital rights to music and video content and if we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially favorable terms as they expire  our revenue could materially decrease 
our long term success depends upon  among other things  our ability to renew our non perpetual rights to music and video content once they expire 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue was derived from digital music distributed under short term distribution agreements that expire in one to five years depending on certain factors 
we are aware that our competitors have solicited a number of the record labels we have under short term distribution agreements  just as we have solicited their record label clients in this highly competitive market 
while we do not expect any net material decrease in revenue and gross profit from these activities  if our competition becomes increasingly aggressive or our level of service provided to our record label clients is not superior to our competition  we may experience a higher rate of non renewal than we have in the past for our short term digital distribution agreements 
if any of our competitors offer better terms  it could cause us to 
table of contents spend more money or grant better terms  or both  to renew the digital rights we currently hold 
in addition  the larger and more prestigious independent record labels  which have traditionally accessed the digital music market through distribution companies like us  could seek direct distribution with digital music retailers when their agreements with us expire or  in the alternative  choose to deliver directly to one or more of the largest digital music retailers  such as itunes  and use distributors only for the lesser retailers 
if we are unable to renew the non perpetual rights to our music and video content on commercially favorable terms  our revenue could materially decrease 
other parties may have digital rights  or claim to have such rights  to our music content  which may result in duplicates of the music recordings we sell to be available for purchase at the digital music services and cause a reduction in our revenue 
we generally acquire or license all of the digital rights that the owner of music content has available to grant  however  the holders of such rights may not possess exclusive rights to those music recordings 
we are unable to determine the number of additional holders of rights to our music recordings 
aside from copyright law  the rights to music recordings are contractual in nature 
there is no central registry or directory that evidences the chain of title to the rights of music recordings other than copyright registration  which is voluntary 
given the age of many of the music recordings we have acquired or licensed or may acquire or license in the future  there is often a lack of documentation to evidence the chain of title 
in addition  there is a common practice in the music industry of licensing rights in various formats or in certain compilations and to grant the same rights to different parties for the same or different geographic regions 
our content acquisition and distribution agreements contain representations  warranties and indemnities only with respect to the digital rights granted to us and not with respect to the rights held by other parties 
we are aware of numerous instances where other parties have legitimate digital rights to the same music recordings to which we have acquired or licensed the digital rights 
if copies of our music recordings are available at the digital music services from alternative sources  our revenue will be reduced to the extent these copies are purchased instead of ours 
we may not receive legal title to the digital rights of music content that we have paid to acquire or license  and any determination that we don t hold such rights may subject us to write offs  claims for damages and lost profits 
our acquisition and distribution agreements with content owners contain representations  warranties and indemnities with respect to the digital rights granted to us 
in certain instances  we have purchased or licensed digital rights that were determined not to be held by the holder from whom we acquired or licensed those rights 
if we were to acquire or make a cash advance for digital content and make available for purchase music recordings from a person who did not actually own such rights and we were unable to enforce or collect on the representations  warranties and indemnities made by such person  our business would be adversely affected 
we would be required to write off the cost of the acquisition or advance  lose the rights to sell such music and might be subject to copyright infringement lawsuits for selling such music recordings without the right to do so 
some of our largest label accounts have drawn multiple adverse claims of this kind 
such lawsuits are expensive to defend  regardless of the outcome  and could subject us to damages  which could be significant 
finally  these situations could adversely impact our reputation with content owners and our relationships with digital music services  which could adversely affect our business 
the declining market for physical recordings such as albums or cds could affect the financial health our label client base  which could have a negative effect on our business 
sales of physical recordings albums and  primarily  cds are still the primary source of revenues for the recording industry generally 
recently  physical sales have been declining but the anticipated increase in digital revenue has not yet made up for the decline in physical revenues 
the decline in revenues from physical sales could negatively affect the finances of our independent label clients  many of whom are thinly capitalized and or suffer marginal cash flow 
this decline in income could affect their ability to continue to sign new artists  market their current artists or even stay in business  which could have a negative effect on our business 

table of contents we could be liable for unpaid mechanical royalty obligations and bear liability for copyright infringement if our label clients fail to license and or pay mechanical copyright royalties owed or if  where contractually obligated to do so  we fail to properly license and or pay mechanical copyright royalties  which could have a negative effect on our business 
mechanical royalties are the statutory or other payment due to the publisher of the underlying musical composition embodied in the master recording 
we administer mechanical royalties for certain artists and record labels 
all other artists and labels that we distribute represent and warrant to us that they will secure the appropriate licenses and pay any royalties due  and agree to indemnify us if they don t 
we believe this is common practice among digital distributors 
as a result  in certain instances and under certain circumstances  if the required payments are not made  we could be liable for unpaid mechanical royalty obligations and bear liability for copyright infringement  which could have a negative effect on our business 
if content owners fail to deliver  or if there are long delays in the time it takes to receive the music and video content that we acquire rights to  our revenue growth will be negatively impacted and our cash flow will be affected adversely 
implementation of our business plan and growth strategy depends on increasing the amount of music and video content we have available to consumers at digital entertainment services 
our purchase and long term distribution agreements typically require the owners to deliver to us their music and video content under an agreement delivery timetable 
under our short term distribution agreements  there is generally no specific delivery timetable  although the content owner is generally required to digitally distribute their entire catalogue to us and promptly provide all the master recordings and metadata to us for processing after execution of the agreement 
some of the content we acquire may be in older physical formats such as audio tape or vinyl records in the case of music recordings  or film  tape or other incompatible digital format in the case of video recordings  which requires processing onto compact disc or digital video disc prior to being delivered to us 
in addition  our agreements require that certain descriptive information required by the digital entertainment services for each music and video be delivered with the content  such as recording title  album title  artist name  genre  copyright information  label name  unique product identifier  artwork  biographical information  sales information and date of release 
historically  it has at times taken several months or longer after we have entered into an agreement before we have received delivery of the music and video content acquired 
in addition  in some cases the quality of the music and videos and metadata initially delivered is not sufficient or the data is not complete and follow up work and effort is required to receive proper and complete delivery  although even with such extra efforts there are no assurances such problems can be cured 
although we generally specify delivery dates and make cash payments by us conditional upon delivery  we do not control the timing for complete receipt of the music and video content we have acquired 
in addition  in certain cases  content owners have over delivered and in others have been unable to deliver all of the content specified in our agreements 
we are typically not required to pay additional consideration for deliveries in excess of contract amounts and are not required to make cash payments for any content that is not delivered  or is defective or otherwise non usable 
however  our expected revenue growth rate is negatively impacted when we do not receive all the content we have contracted for 
if there are long delays in the time it takes for the owners to deliver to us the music and video content in physical format or complete data format and the related complete descriptive information  it will delay our ability to begin the process of converting the content into the digital formats required by digital entertainment services 
it could also cause inefficiencies in the utilization of our operations personnel who process these recordings 
any delay in making our music and video content available for purchase at the digital entertainment services will delay our revenue growth  and inefficiencies caused by such delays could cause a reduction in our cash flow in the interim 
any extended delay by digital entertainment services in processing and making our music and video content available to consumers causes a delay in our ability to earn revenue from such content 
following receipt of music and video content from the owners  we convert them into the specific digital formats required by digital entertainment services 
we then deliver the music and video content in digital format  together with their associated descriptive information and artwork  to the digital entertainment services to be made available to consumers in the specific territories where we have acquired the digital rights 
the digital entertainment services must then review our music and video content  descriptive information and artwork to ensure that they are in the proper format for their store or service 
the content is only made available to consumers once the digital retailer or service has completed its review  encrypted the content with the particular retailer s if applicable digital 
table of contents rights management protection and other retailer or service specific coding  and posted the digital files on the retailer s or services computer servers 
we are subject to the digital entertainment services internal processing timing and priorities 
our agreements with the digital entertainment services do not provide for a fixed processing time 
any extended delay in making our music and video content available to consumers causes a delay in when we can begin to earn revenue and return on investment from our content 
if we seek to acquire content through the acquisition of record labels or other companies that own master rights to music or video content  we may not be able to successfully integrate these companies 
we may attempt to acquire record labels or other companies that own master rights to music or video content for purposes of acquiring their digital rights 
in the event we are able to acquire such record labels or other companies  we may be subject to a number of risks related to the integration and management of such companies  including failure to obtain valid consents to assignment of contracts  including contracts granting rights to music content  failure of the business of the acquired company to achieve expected results  diversion of our management s attention  failure to retain key personnel of the acquired company  as well as the assumption of certain liabilities owed to such record labels and companies original grantors  artists  music publishers and other third parties 
in addition  if we undertake an acquisition of a company that operates non digital businesses or owns non digital rights to music and video content  we may attempt to operate the non digital businesses or sell the non digital rights to another person or entity  and we may not be able to do so in a manner or on terms favorable to us 
if we are not able to integrate and scale our reporting and payment processes  we may experience delays providing reports to the content owners and paying required royalties that could have a negative effect on our brand identity 
we receive regular sales reports from digital entertainment services that contain sales information for our music and video content 
based on these reports  we provide summary reports to the content owners 
when we acquire the perpetual digital rights to music content and in certain of our distribution agreements  we may assume the obligations of the content owner to pay any required royalty payments to the artists according to the terms of the existing agreements 
in addition  we may be required to pay statutory publishing royalties on behalf of the content owner according to the terms of our agreements 
as we integrate the extensive databases and information systems and acquire digital rights to additional music and video content  we may experience difficulties in preparing and distributing sales reports for the content owners or processing and paying artist and publishing royalties in a timely fashion  which could result in adverse claims by content owners 
if we are not able to successfully expand our processing capability or introduce technology to allow us to determine and pay royalty amounts due and automate these tasks  we may experience delays as we increase the volume of our music and video content  which could have a negative effect on our relationships with content owners and brand identity 
we may need to raise additional capital to accomplish our objectives and  if we are unable to raise such funds as needed  our growth would be limited 
we may use our common stock in addition to our cash for the consideration for future acquisitions of digital rights to additional music and video content and or for the acquisition of other businesses in the digital media industry 
if our common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value or content and business owners are unwilling to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of the digital rights to their music and video content or their businesses or as consideration for licensed rights to their music and video content  we may be required to utilize more of our cash resources  if available 
we intend to be more aggressive in this area and may require additional financing in the future 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources  our ability to acquire additional rights to music and video content and ancillary businesses could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our ability to obtain financing will depend  among other things  on our development efforts  business plans  operating performance and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
using cash to finance acquisitions could substantially limit our financial flexibility and using debt could result in financial covenants that limit our operations and financial flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity linked or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock  and our common stockholders may experience dilution 

table of contents we face a potential loss of music content if it is determined that recording artists have a right to recapture rights in their content under the us copyright act 
the us copyright act provides authors and their heirs a right to terminate licenses or assignments of rights in their copyrighted works that were not works made for hire 
if any of our music content were determined not to be works made for hire  then the recording artists or their heirs could have the right to terminate the rights we hold 
these residual author rights generally survive for five years after the end of the year period from the date of a post license or assignment  and in the case of a pre grant in a pre recording  five years after the end of the year period from the date of creation or january   whichever is later 
any termination of our rights to our music content could result in a material reduction in our revenue 
risks relating to our common stock dimensional associates  llc has significant influence on all stockholder votes and has effective control over the outcome of actions requiring the approval of our stockholders 
dimensional associates  llc  or dimensional  beneficially owns shares of our capital stock representing approximately of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock 
dimensional thus has the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management policies and strategic focus  could control the outcome of almost any matter submitted to our stockholders and has the ability to elect or remove all of our directors 
there is a risk that the interests of dimensional will not be consistent with the interests of other holders of our common stock 
dimensional has significant control over our business and significant transactions 
in addition to the effects described above  dimensional s control of our company could make it more difficult for us to raise capital by selling stock or for us to use our stock as consideration in acquisitions 
this concentrated ownership also might delay or prevent a change in control and may impede or prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
sales of common stock by dimensional could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in connection with the merger  we entered into a registration rights agreement with dimensional and the other former stockholders of orchard ny requiring us  under certain circumstances  to register all of the shares of common stock that will be beneficially owned by them as a result of the merger 
the exercise of these registration rights or sale by dimensional in the public market pursuant to any such registration could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we do not intend to pay dividends 
we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our operations and for general corporate purposes  including future acquisitions 
in addition  future financings may contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock 
provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
our charter documents may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they authorize our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue shares of preferred stock with rights and designations determined solely by our board of directors  and establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to the delaware anti takeover provisions contained in section of the delaware general corporation law 
under delaware law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or  among other things  the board of directors has approved the transaction 
our board of directors could rely on this provision to prevent or delay an acquisition of our company 

table of contents our stock price is subject to fluctuation and could decline and could result in our being delisted from trading on the nasdaq global market 
the price at which our common stock has traded since its initial public offering in february has fluctuated significantly 
the price is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly due to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control imbalances between the market supply and demand for shares of our stock due to the limited number of shares available in the public float  variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts  investors and the financial community  announcements of developments affecting our business  systems or expansion plans by us or others  and conditions and trends in online commerce industries and the mobile communications industry  particularly as they relate to the digital entertainment services and mobile carriers 
as a result of these and other factors  investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price or trade them on the nasdaq global market if our stock price failed to meet the continued listing standards 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by existing stockholders in the public market such as dimensional may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock 
shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options granted to our employees and directors also may be sold in the public market 
such sales could create the perception to the public of difficulties or problems with our business 
as a result  these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell securities in the future at a time and price that we deem necessary or appropriate 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we maintain directors and officers liability insurance for this type of litigation 
however  if such litigation is directed at us  it could result in substantial costs  including the deductible amount under our insurance policy and other indirect costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we occupy approximately  square feet of office space at park avenue in new york  new york  under a lease agreement that expires on january  we vacated our former headquarters in sacramento and are endeavoring to negotiate early termination of the lease  which runs through may  we vacated our former space in san francisco and exercised an early termination right to end the lease as of august  in addition  we maintain a small suite of offices at floral street and covent garden  london  england pursuant to a license having an automatic renewal every two months  and lease office space in paris  france  berlin  germany and santa monica  california 
we anticipate the need to acquire additional office space in new york city in the near future and expect that our rental costs will increase substantially from the amounts historically paid in connection with the expiration of our lease in item legal proceedings we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
on march   we initiated suit in federal court in the eastern district of california against tufamerica  inc the complaint alleges fraud  breach of contract and various other wrongs in connection with a contract dispute with tufamerica  inc concerning the number  nature and technical quality of master recordings the label was required to deliver to our company under the contract 
we requested various forms of relief from the court  including the return of approximately million in fees and advances already paid under the contract 
tufamerica  inc has not yet formally responded to these claims  although during the course of the dispute tufamerica  inc had sent a letter to our company claiming damages in the amount of approximately million 
because the litigation is in its early stages  we are unable to determine if the outcome of this case will be favorable to our company

our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us described in risk factors 
overview background and basis of presentation on november   the orchard enterprises  inc formerly known as digital music group  inc or dmgi consummated a business combination with orchard enterprises ny  inc formerly known as the orchard enterprises inc  which we refer to as orchard ny through a merger of a subsidiary of dmgi with and into orchard ny pursuant to the terms of the second amended and restated merger agreement dated october   as amended on november  the merger 
pursuant to the terms of the merger  all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of orchard ny was cancelled and the former stockholders of orchard ny received an aggregate of  shares of dmgi common stock after giving effect to a one for three reverse stock split of dmgi s common stock that took effect on november  and  shares of dmgi series a convertible preferred stock the dmgi series a preferred stock 
in addition  dmgi assumed the obligations of orchard ny under its outstanding deferred common and preferred stock awards and reserved  shares of dmgi common stock on a post split basis and  shares of dmgi series a preferred stock for issuance pursuant to such awards 
in connection with the merger  orchard ny became our wholly owned subsidiary  with the former stockholders of orchard ny collectively owning shares of our common and preferred stock representing approximately of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 
the orchard enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as we  us  and the company 
see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report for further details on the merger 
for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition with orchard ny being the accounting acquirer 
accordingly  the historical financial results prior to the merger are those of orchard ny and its consolidated subsidiaries and replace the historical financial results of dmgi as it existed prior to the merger 
the results of operations for dmgi and its pre merger consolidated subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial results beginning on november  the presentation of consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficit and redeemable preferred stock reflects the historical stockholders equity of orchard ny through november  the effect of the issuance of shares of dmgi common stock and dmgi series a preferred stock in connection with the merger and the inclusion of dmgi s outstanding shares of common stock at the time of the merger on november  is reflected in the year ended december  orchard ny was incorporated in new york in september on april   dimensional associates  llc  or dimensional  an entity formed by a group of private investors  invested in and acquired operating control of orchard ny through the purchase of a convertible debt instrument followed by subsequent periodic funding events under similar conditions as the original convertible debt instrument 
these debt instruments were redeemed or converted prior to completion of the merger and are described below in liquidity and capital resources description of indebtedness and in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a global leader in digital media services  controlling and distributing more than  music and other audio recordings  or tracks  and over  hours of video programming through hundreds of digital stores eg  itunes  emusic  google  netflix and mobile carriers eg  verizon  vodafone  bell canada  moderati  worldwide 
we generate income for our label  retailer  brand and agency clients by making these music and audio recordings and videos available for purchase at the online stores and through innovative marketing and promotional campaigns  branded entertainment programs  film  advertising  gaming and television licensing  among other services 

table of contents significant customers since inception through december   our revenue has been derived primarily from the distribution of digital music content 
two customers  itunes and emusic which is controlled by our majority shareholder  account for a significant portion of our total revenue and related accounts receivable 
for the years ended december  and  itunes represented and of total revenue and emusic represented and of total revenue  respectively 
accounts receivable from itunes were and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable from emusic were and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
sources of revenues our revenues are derived from the following sources permanent downloads 
in aggregate terms  our permanent download revenue is driven by the number of music recordings we have available for downloading at digital music retailers  multiplied by the average number of times our music recordings are downloaded  multiplied by the fee paid to us by each retailer 
the download rates for our music recordings are driven primarily by the overall size and growth of the digital music market  the popularity and demand for the recordings we make available  the number and nature of the digital music services through which we make the recordings available to consumers  and our territorial distribution rights 
we negotiate the fee we receive per download in advance at the time we enter into an agreement with a digital music retailer 
subscription download services on the internet 
we also generate revenues from services that offer consumers the ability to download up to a certain number of recordings each month for a fixed subscription fee 
in such models  we typically receive a percentage of the total revenue pool generated by the service  after contractually specified costs and deductions  based on our share of total downloads in the service during the billing period 
subscription streaming fees 
some digital music retailers distribute our music recordings via streaming on a subscription basis 
our subscription revenue is a percentage of each retailer s total subscription revenue after contractually specified costs and deductions based on the number of times our music recordings are listened to by subscribers as compared to the total for all music recordings listened to during the relevant time period  although the exact formulations by which our revenue is derived varies between services 
following the termination of their subscription  consumers are not able to play our music recordings 
mobile services 
our revenue from mobile services is derived primarily from downloads of full length music recordings and mastertones 
most mobile services generally make available to consumers a limited selection of ringtones due to the limited space on mobile handset screens and higher per track processing costs related to the many formats that are required for various mobile handset makes and models  although this is changing 
other 
our other revenue is comprised mainly from licensing fees also referred to as music services  administrative and consulting fees and other sources such as technology related servicing fees charged to certain digital music retailers and other non retail clients 
combined revenue from digital downloads and subscription fees comprised approximately of our total revenue for each of the years ended december  and approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived from mobile services 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of revenue sharing payments and recoupment of cash advances to artists  record labels and other content owners  royalties to artists and publishers  
table of contents amortization of costs to acquire master recordings  digital rights and digital distribution agreements  reserves or write downs of master recordings  capitalized digital rights  digital distribution agreements or royalty advances that may be deemed necessary from time to time  and 
other direct costs of revenues  our cost of revenues and corresponding gross profit is determined by the revenues earned on our available music and audio content 
in our digital distribution agreements with content owners  which usually have terms of two to five years  we typically have an exclusive right to collect revenue directly from the digital entertainment services 
we then pay a negotiated revenue sharing percentage to the content owner 
in certain instances  with respect to higher profile labels and or as an inducement to enter into a longer term license agreement  we may make a royalty advance against the content owner s share of future royalties 
we capitalize all such advances as a prepaid asset that we amortize as a cost of revenue as the related revenue is earned and the cash advances are recouped 
we also include in cost of revenues the fees and direct costs incurred in obtaining content 
for long term distribution agreements  we amortize the legal fees and other direct costs incurred in acquiring the agreement on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the related agreement or ten years 
when we acquire digital rights or master recordings  we capitalize the purchase price and the direct ancillary costs and amortize the acquisition costs on a straight line basis over ten years 
while we are typically not responsible for any third party royalties such as artists and publishers in our agreements with content owners  for music content that we own and for content distributed under most of our long term distribution agreements  we are typically responsible for some or all third party royalties such as artists and publishers  the cost of which is included in cost of revenues 
artist royalty obligations for music and audio recordings have historically been between and of the revenue attributable to a specific track or album 
the publisher royalties for music and audio recordings are a statutory rate in the united states  which was 
for and in connection with the allocation of the purchase price to the assets we were deemed to have acquired from dmgi for accounting purposes  we established an asset called digital distribution agreements  which is a component of music and audio content  to reflect the estimated fair market value of dmgi s license agreements at the merger date 
we are amortizing this asset to cost of revenues over the term of the related agreements 
we include in cost of revenues depreciation and amortization associated with equipment and computer software that we use to digitally encode music files 
historically  when we have utilized third parties to digitally encode music files into the specific formats required by digital entertainment services  we also included these costs in cost of revenues 
we also charge any other third party costs directly associated with earning other revenue to cost of revenues 
operating expenses include all costs associated with general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing and product development in order to operate the business 
seasonality we are not able to identify definitively seasonality in our business because of the early stage nature of the entire digital distribution industry and our limited operating history 
however  we suspect that the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year may have seasonally higher sales  because this is the peak time for sales of music recordings in physical format generally ascribed to increased consumer spending due to the holidays 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience and on various other 
table of contents factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information relating to these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition and assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
in general  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  the product or services have been delivered and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our distribution revenue from the sale of music recordings through digital distribution channels is recognized when the products are sold by the digital service providers  which provide us with periodic notification of the sales 
for arrangements with multiple obligations eg  deliverable and undelivered music content  music publishing information and other services  we allocate revenues to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value 
we recognize revenues allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenues set forth above are met 
if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligations is not available  the arrangement consideration allocable to a delivered item is combined with the amount allocable to the undelivered item s within the arrangement 
revenues are recognized as the remaining obligations are fulfilled 
revenues from multiple element arrangements were not significant during and in accordance with industry practice and as is customary in many territories  certain physical products such as cds and cassettes are sold to customers with the right to return unsold items 
we recognize net distribution revenues from such physical sales when reported to us by the retail distributor for the products that are shipped based on gross sales typically less a provision for future estimated returns determined by distributor based on historical trends 
during and  revenues from physical sales were not significant 
we recognize reimbursements received from our customers for encoding our music content in the appropriate digital format for use by the customer under the proportional performance method as revenue in the period that the encoded content is delivered to the customer 
we record cash received in advance of providing the service as deferred revenue 
we record the costs associated with shipping physical products as cost of revenues 
shipping and handling charges billed to customers are included in revenues 
the physical products are the property of the recording labels and artists 
revenues and cost from shipping and handling were not significant in or because we receive payment at approximately the same time as we receive the detailed revenue reports  our accounts receivable therefore generally consists of approximately one month s revenue for digital entertainment services that report on a monthly basis and one quarter s revenue for digital entertainment services that report on a quarterly basis 
in making estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our management considers the credit profile of our retailers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  historic payment experience and known or expected events that may impact the retailer s ability to pay its obligations 
historically  we have incurred minimal losses for bad debts  although this may not be the case in the future 
we maintained a bad debt allowance of  at december  and  at december  recoverability of royalty advances we pay advance royalties to certain record labels and artists and account for these advance royalty payments pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 financial reporting in the record and music industry sfas 
pursuant to sfas  certain advance royalty payments that are believed to be recoverable from future royalties to be earned by the content owner or its distributor are capitalized as assets 
the decision to capitalize an advance to a content owner or its distributor as an asset requires significant judgment as to the recoverability of these advances 
we assess the recoverability of these assets upon initial 
table of contents commitment of the advance based upon our forecast of anticipated revenues from the sale of future and existing music and publishing related products 
in determining whether these amounts are recoverable  we evaluate the current and past popularity of the artist or songwriter  the initial or expected commercial acceptability of the product  the current and past popularity of the genre of music that the product is designed to appeal to  and other relevant factors 
based upon this information  the portion of such advances that is believed not to be recoverable is expensed 
all advances are assessed for recoverability periodically and  at minimum  on a quarterly basis 
accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when management is unable to conclude that our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
at each of the financial statement dates presented  we recorded a full valuation allowance against deferred income taxes due to our limited operating history and net losses recorded since inception 
our estimate for the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about projected future operating results 
if actual results differ from these projections or if management s expectations of future results change  it may be necessary to adjust the valuation allowance 
we have generated losses for federal and state income tax reporting since inception 
these tax losses are available for carryforward until their expiration 
in addition to potential expiration  there are other factors that could limit our ability to use our federal and state tax loss carryforwards 
for example  use of prior net operating loss carryforwards can be limited after an ownership change  such as the merger 
accordingly  it is not certain how much of our existing net operating loss carryforwards will be available for use 
in addition  we must generate taxable income in the future in order to use net operating loss carryforwards that have not expired 
effective january   we began to measure and record uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions under fin involves significant judgments by management 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including license rights  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in connection with this review  we reevaluate the periods of depreciation and amortization 
we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is determined using the projected discounted future net cash flows 
we measure fair value by discounting estimated future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense  under the provisions of statement no 
revised of the financial accounting standards board  share based compensation 
as a result  we recognize compensation 
table of contents expense in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of share based awards and issuances  such as stock options and warrants granted to employees and non employees 
this estimation of the fair value of each share based grant or issuance on the date of grant involves numerous assumptions by management 
although we calculate the compensatory element under the trinomial lattice model  which is a standard option pricing model  this model still requires the use of numerous assumptions 
assumptions used in this model include  among others  the expected life turnover  a risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and assumptions as to volatility of the underlying equity security 
the model and assumptions also attempt to account for changing employee behavior as the stock price changes and capture the observed pattern of increasing rates of exercise as the stock price increases 
we based our assumption of the expected volatility of our stock using the historical volatility for our peer group public companies because sufficient historical trading data does not yet exist for our stock 
the use of different peer group companies and other assumptions by management in the trinomial lattice model could produce substantially different results 
goodwill our goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets of dmgi as a result of the merger 
we will review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we will compare the fair value to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill will not be considered impaired and we will not be required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the implied fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
impairment of intangible assets we test our intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment annually  and more frequently if there are indications of a loss in value 
the most significant intangible assets that we test for impairment are those resulting from the merger 
we test for impairment on the basis of the same objective criteria that were used for the initial valuation 
our initial valuation and ongoing tests are based on the relationship of the value of our projected future cash flows associated with the asset to either the purchase price of the asset for its initial valuation or the carrying amount of the asset for ongoing tests 
the determination of the underlying assumptions related to the recoverability of intangible assets is subjective and requires the exercise of considerable judgment by our management 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for our company beginning january   except with respect to its non financial assets for which the effective date is january  our adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of sfas is prohibited 
after its effective date  sfas would have an impact on the presentation and disclosure of the non controlling interests of any non wholly owned businesses we may acquire in the future 
internal control over financial reporting in connection with the audit for the year ended december   our independent auditors identified significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting regarding our lack of formalized written policies and procedures in the financial accounting area  our lack of appropriate resources to both manage the financial close process on a timely basis and handle the accounting for complex equity and other transactions  our lack of sophisticated financial reporting systems to allow the reporting of financial information on a timely basis  which is due in part to the small size of our company prior to the merger  and our lack of a formalized disaster recovery plan in the information technology area 
these significant deficiencies together constitute a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
these significant deficiencies  along with the actions taken to remedy the significant deficiencies identified by our former independent auditors in connection with their audit of our consolidated financial statements  are described in item a t controls and procedures 
factors affecting future results we have incurred losses since inception and our ability to achieve profitability in the near term is primarily dependent on increasing revenue while controlling and limiting expenses at current levels 
some of the current industry conditions and factors that we expect could have a significant impact on our future results are discussed below factors impacting revenue and download rates for music content 
achieving profitable growth will require continued growth in the overall market for digital retail sales of music  video and other forms of media  and our ability to maintain a competitive suite of digital distribution and service offerings that will be attractive to independent record labels and other owners of digital media content 
we expect continued competition from entrenched music distribution companies moving more aggressively into the digital sector eg  the distribution companies owned by the four major music companies  other independent distributors  and new entrants to the market 
we believe that our revenue and download rates for music content might be affected by a number of macro factors  including overall growth of the legitimate retail consumer market for digital music  in the context of a still robust so called peer to peer pp pirate market  amount of additional digital music and video recordings that are made available to consumers from all sources and the impact on average sales that results from having an increasing amount of music and video content available within the retail channels  the speed and efficacy with which new digital entertainment services either through traditional a la carte downloads or subscription models  or new forms of music retail such as advertising based or pp models enter and grow the market  and 
table of contents the speed and efficacy with which digital music retailers invest on one hand in product enhancements that allow them to more dynamically serve music to targeted subgroups eg  ethnic nationals living abroad and  on the other hand  particularly with respect to mobile operators  integrate their sophisticated marketing segmentation and direct marketing capabilities more closely with demographically based music marketing 
gross profit 
our gross profit is directly affected by our ability to negotiate favorable digital distribution agreements with record labels and other content owners 
the current and future marketplace will continue to evolve and shape our ability to enter into new distribution agreements with content owners seeking to access the digital marketplace and renew existing agreements as they begin to expire 
as more competitors enter this market and seek to sign similar agreements with content owners  this could adversely impact our gross profit 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses include all costs associated with general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing and product development in order to operate the business 
these expenses increased in each of the past three years as we added additional personnel dedicated to expanding our operations and broadening our product and service offerings 
business development 
we plan to continue to build our core music and video businesses by building on our established digital distribution relationships and by adding additional record labels and content owners  showcasing top tier global artists  and expanding our marketing capabilities 
we also plan to continue to develop our broad services platform  including marketing and technology programs to service brands  consumer packaged goods companies and other businesses integrating music with their marketing objectives  placement of master recordings for synchronization use in advertising  film and television programs  mechanical licensing and administration of music publishing for digital sales in the united states  collection of sound performance recording royalties globally  among other offerings

comparison of year ended december  to december  revenues 
revenues increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  with approximately million of the increase attributable to the consolidation of dmgi following the november merger 
revenue from digital distribution including permanent downloads and subscription services increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of the increase in paid downloads 
the increase in paid downloads resulted from a significant increase in the average number of available tracks for sale  as well as a more efficient distribution process  in part due to the launch of our proprietary vector tm system in the first half of revenue from mobile distribution increased to approximately million in from approximately million in as a result of adding additional mobile stores  increased available content for our mobile channel partners and overall favorable industry trends 
other revenue from licensing and music services including placement of master recordings for use in film  television and commercials  physical sales  and other sources such as service fees charged to digital music retailers and other non retail clients  increased to approximately million in the from approximately million in cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  royalty expense 
table of contents to artists  labels and other content owners increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily related to the increase in overall revenues 
during the years ended december  and  our royalties paid to artists  labels and other content owners amounted to and of revenues  respectively

other costs of revenues increased to million in as compared to approximately million in gross profit margin declined to of revenues in from of revenues in  primarily because included a one time fee concession of million or of revenues from a digital encoding service provider 
operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the individual components of our operating expenses for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  percentage percentage amount of total amount of total personnel related expenses professional fees office expenses travel expenses marketing other expenses total operating expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to increased personnel costs 
the increase in personnel costs for is partly due to a one time non cash compensation expense of approximately million 
excluding the one time non cash compensation expense  our personnel costs increased as a result of an overall increase in our head count  as we added to staff to keep up with growth  which growth also resulted in an increase in travel expenses and office expenses 
other expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in the reserve for bad debts 
in prior periods  we analyzed the components of our operating expenses under the captions general and administrative  sales and marketing and product development  which presentation reflected a grouping of the components of our operating expenses including compensation and other personnel related costs that was generally based on headcount per function within our company 
going forward  we intend to analyze our operating expenses as set forth in the table above  as we believe this is a better reflection of how we view and manage our operating expenses internally

we had other expense of approximately million for the year ended december   an increase from approximately million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  we had approximately  of interest income in compared to nominal interest income in we had approximately  of other expenses in primarily due to  in non cash charges related to a beneficial conversion charge in connection with the recapitalization of shares while we had other income of  in from the write off of both a disputed note payable and related interest for which the statute of limitations for enforcement of the debt had expired 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
historically  we have received funds from dimensional our majority shareholder to operate our business 
however  subsequent to the merger  we do not expect this to continue 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and management believes cash balances on hand will be 
table of contents sufficient to fund our net cash commitments and requirements over the next months 
should additional resources be required  management may seek to raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash flows for the year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was approximately million 
the reconciliation of net loss of approximately million to net cash used in operations for the year ended december  included non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of approximately million  bad debt expense of approximately million and stock based compensation of approximately million 
these net non cash charges were partially offset by working capital requirements of approximately million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was approximately million 
the reconciliation of net loss of approximately million to net cash used in operations for the year ended december  included non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of approximately million  bad debt expense of million and stock based compensation of approximately million of stock based compensation  offset by non cash income of approximately million in connection with the write off of a disputed note payable and related interest 
these non cash charges were further offset by reduced working capital requirements of approximately million  primarily because royalties payable increased at a faster rate than accounts receivable as our business continued to expand in our investing activities resulted in a net cash contribution of approximately million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the merger  but our investing activities also used million in connection with the purchase of property and equipment 
in  investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of approximately million to purchase property and equipment  which was partially offset by  of proceeds from the sale of certain property and equipment
