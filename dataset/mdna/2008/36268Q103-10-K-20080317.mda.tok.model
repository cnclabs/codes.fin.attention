item a 
risk factors we wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those risks described below that we are presently aware of 
additional risks and uncertainties that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations  and historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could also impact our results of operations 
future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels  consumer confidence  business conditions  stock market volatility  weather conditions  acts of terrorism  threats of war  and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products 
if the economic conditions and performance of the retail and media environment worsen  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
increased competition could impact our financial results we believe that the lohas market includes thousands of small  local and regional businesses 
some smaller businesses may be able to more effectively personalize their relationships with customers  thereby gaining a competitive advantage 
although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company that offers our entire range of merchandise and services  within each category we have competitors and we may face competition from new entrants 
some of our competitors or our potential competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and greater brand recognition 
in addition  larger  well established and well financed entities may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors 
increased competition from these or other competitors could negatively impact our business 
changing consumer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business we target our business at consumers who assign high value to personal development  healthy lifestyles  responsible media  renewable energy and the environment 
a decrease of consumer interest in purchasing goods and services that promote the values we espouse would materially and adversely affect our customer base and sales revenues and  accordingly  our financial prospects 
further  consumer preferences and product trends are difficult to predict 
our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends could lead to  among other things  lower sales of our products  increased merchandise returns and lower margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our strategy of offering branded products could lead to inventory risk and higher costs an important part of our strategy is to feature branded products 
these products are sold under our brand names and are manufactured to our specifications 
we expect our reliance on branded merchandise to increase 
the use of branded merchandise requires us to incur costs and risks relating to the design and purchase of products  including submitting orders earlier and making longer initial purchase commitments 
in addition  the use of branded merchandise limits our ability to return unsold products to vendors  which can result in higher markdowns in order to sell excess inventory 
our commitment to customer service typically results in us keeping a high level of merchandise in stock so we can fill orders quickly 
consequently  we run the risk of having excess inventory  which may also contribute to higher markdowns 
our failure to successfully execute a branded merchandise strategy or to achieve anticipated profit margins on these goods  or a higher than anticipated level of overstocks  may materially adversely affect our revenues 
we offer our customers liberal merchandise return policies 
our consolidated financial statements include a reserve for anticipated merchandise returns  which is based on historical return rates 
it is possible that actual returns may increase as a result of factors such as the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix or other factors 
any increase in our merchandise returns will correspondingly reduce our revenues 
acquisitions may harm our financial results we have historically expanded our operations in part through strategic acquisitions 
we cannot accurately predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts 
our acquisition strategy involves significant risks that could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results  including the following our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices  our ability to complete successfully the acquisitions of candidates that we identify  our ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities  increases in asking prices by acquisition candidates to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria  diversion of management s attention to expansion efforts  unanticipated costs and contingent liabilities associated with acquisitions  failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results  our failure to retain key customers or personnel of acquired businesses and difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience 
in addition  the size  timing and success of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year 
these fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the loss of the services of our key personnel could disrupt our business we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly jirka rysavy and lynn powers 
our strategy of allowing the management teams of some acquired companies to continue to exercise significant management responsibility for those companies makes it important that we retain key employees  particularly the sales and creative teams  of the companies we might acquire 
our founder and chief executive officer jirka rysavy controls us mr 
rysavy holds of our  outstanding shares of class b common stock and also owns  shares of class a common stock 
the shares of class b common stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock at any time 
each share of class b common stock has ten votes per share  and each share of class a common stock has one vote per share 
consequently  mr 
rysavy is able to vote a majority of our stock  to exert substantial influence over us and to control matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors  increasing our authorized capital stock  or a merger or sale of our assets 
as a result of mr 
rysavy s control  no change of control of us can occur without mr 
rysavy s consent 
our success depends on the value of our brand because of our reliance on sales of proprietary products  our success depends on our brand 
building and maintaining recognition of our brand are important to attracting and expanding our customer base 
if the value of our brand were adversely affected  we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new customers  retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases  and if the value of our brand were to diminish  our revenues  results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 
disputes concerning media content and intellectual property may adversely affect us most of our media content is subject to arrangements with third parties pursuant to which we have licensed certain rights to use and distribute media content owned by third parties or have licensed to third parties certain rights to use and distribute media content that we own 
in addition  we have a number of agreements with third parties concerning the use of our media content and intellectual property  including agreements regarding royalties  distribution  duplication  etc 
allegations that we do not have rights to use media content and other disputes arising from such arrangements can be costly and may have a material adverse impact on our results 
product liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages 
as a seller of consumer products  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that use of products we sell results in injuries 
if such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur  we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity 
the successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and  if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims  could require us to make significant payments from our own resources 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for the success of our proprietary products we are dependent on the success of our proprietary products  and we rely on a select group of manufacturers to provide us with sufficient quantities to meet our customers demands in a timely manner  produce these products in a humane and safe environment for both their workers and the planet  maintain quality standards consistent with our brand  and meet certain pricing guarantees 
our overseas sourcing of these products continues to increase  and these arrangements carry risks associated with relying on products manufactured outside of the us  including political unrest and trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  transportation difficulties  work stoppages  and other uncertainties 
in addition  a number of our suppliers are small companies  and some of these vendors may not have sufficient capital  resources or personnel to increase their sales to us or to meet our needs for increased commitments from them 
the failure of our suppliers to provide sufficient quantities of our proprietary products could decrease our revenues  increase our costs  and damage our customer service reputation 
we rely on communications and shipping networks to deliver our products given our emphasis on customer service  the efficient and uninterrupted operation of order processing and fulfillment functions is critical to our business 
to maintain a high level of customer service  we rely heavily on a number of different outside service providers  such as printers  telecommunications companies and delivery companies 
any interruption in services from our principal outside service providers  including delays or disruptions resulting from labor disputes  power outages  human error  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  freight carriers must ship products that we source overseas to our distribution center  and a work stoppage or political unrest could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders 
information systems upgrades or integrations may disrupt our operations or financial reporting we continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems  which are critical to our business 
these systems assist in processing orders  managing inventory  purchasing and shipping merchandise on a timely basis  responding to customer service inquiries  and gathering and analyzing operating data by business segment  customer  and stock keeping unit a specific identifier for each different product 
we are required to continually update these systems 
furthermore  if we acquire other companies  we will need to integrate the acquired companies systems with ours  a process that could be time consuming and costly 
if our systems cannot accommodate our growth or if they fail  we could incur substantial expenses and our business could be adversely affected 
additionally  our success in e commerce will depend upon our ability to provide a compelling and satisfying shopping experience 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our online technology  and if we are unable to do this  our business could be adversely affected 
a material security breach could cause us to lose sales  damage our reputation or result in liability to us our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
we may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective 
we currently rely on security and authentication technology that we license from third parties 
we may not succeed in preventing all security breaches and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business 
our systems may fail or limit user traffic  which would cause us to lose sales we support most of our business through our call center in broomfield  colorado 
even though we have back up arrangements  we are dependent on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in this center in effective working order and to protect against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
in addition  growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our computer and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure 
we have experienced capacity constraints and failure of information systems in the past that have resulted in decreased levels of service delivery or interruptions in service to customers for limited periods of time 
although we continually review and consider upgrades to our technical infrastructure and provide for system redundancies and backup power to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure  substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business 
additionally  if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our infrastructure  including our call center  our ability to grow may be constrained 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws  as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services and quality of products and services 
there is lack of clarity on how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce 
unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business 
we may face legal liability for the content contained on our website we could face legal liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  personal injury or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute on our website 
if we are held liable for damages for the content on our website  our business may suffer 
further  one of our goals is for www 
gaiam 
com to be a trustworthy and dependable provider of information and services 
allegations of impropriety  even if unfounded  could therefore have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business 
relying on our centralized fulfillment center could expose us to losing revenue prompt and efficient fulfillment of our customers orders is critical to our business 
our facility in cincinnati  ohio handles our fulfillment functions and some customer service related operations  such as returns processing 
a majority of our orders are filled and shipped from the cincinnati facility 
the balance is shipped directly from suppliers 
because we rely on a centralized fulfillment center  our fulfillment functions could be severely impaired in the event of fire  extended adverse weather conditions  transportation difficulties or natural disasters 
because we recognize revenue only when we ship orders  interruption of our shipping would diminish our revenues 
we may face quarterly and seasonal fluctuations that could harm our business our revenue and results of operations have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of catalog offerings  timing of orders from retailers  recognition of costs or net sales contributed by new merchandise  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in paper  production and postage costs and expenses  merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in our merchandise mix 
in particular  our net sales and profits have historically been higher during the fourth quarter holiday season 
we believe that this seasonality will continue in the future 
postage and shipping costs may increase and therefore increase our expenses we ship our products  catalogs  and lifestyle publications to consumers and the cost of shipping is a material expenditure 
postage and shipping prices increase periodically and can be expected to increase in the future 
any inability to secure suitable or commercially favorable prices or other terms for the delivery of our merchandise and catalogs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change  which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the nasdaq  periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the sarbanes oxley act of as interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues  we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses

overview and outlook we are a lifestyle media company providing a broad selection of information  media  products and services to customers who value personal development  wellness  ecological lifestyles  responsible media and conscious community 
our media brand is built around our ability to develop and offer media content  products  lifestyle solutions and community to consumers in the lohas and the emerging conscious media markets 
we offer our customers the ability to make purchasing decisions and find responsible content based on these values while providing quality offerings at a price comparable to mainstream alternatives 
we market our media and products through a multi channel approach including traditional media channels  direct to consumers via the internet  direct response marketing  community  subscriptions  catalog  and through national retailers and corporate accounts 
our content forms the basis of our proprietary offerings  which then drive demand for parallel product and service offerings 
our operations are vertically integrated from content creations  through product development and sourcing  to customer service and distribution 
we market our products and services across two segments  business and direct to consumer 
we distribute products in each of these sales segments from a single fulfillment center or drop ship products directly to customers 
our business segment sells directly to retailers  both domestically and abroad with our products now available in approximately  retail doors in the united states 
during  this segment generated revenues of million  up from million during  reflecting an increase 
this increase reflects our successful entrance into the international market and store within store expansion 
during the year we expanded our store within store presence to over  lifestyle presentations  which are custom fixtures that we design 
through its diverse media reach  the direct to consumer segment provides an opportunity to launch and support new media releases  a sounding board for new product testing  promotional opportunities  a growing community  and customer feedback on us and the lohas industry s focus and future 
during  this segment generated revenues of million  up from million during this increase reflects growth of with the continued investment into branded direct response marketing  membership programs and solar energy integrations 
during  we completed several acquisitions targeted towards expanding and enhancing our media content and community reach 
these acquisitions included zaadz  a social networking site in the lohas space  lime  a multimedia lifestyle company  conscious enlightenment  an on line and off line community  and a solar energy integration company 
we believe our growth will be driven by information  media content  products  and community delivered to the consumer via broadcast  catalog  internet  retailers  international licensing  electronic downloads and subscription systems 
we have increased our focus on our media content creation and distribution  which strategically provides increased branding opportunities  significantly higher operating contribution and greater mainstream penetration 
we plan to invest in our community and membership businesses over the next two years to better capitalize on strong relationships with our loyal consumer audience and growing broadband 
this will allow us to focus on better leveraging our content 
we believe a number of factors are important to our long term success  including building our brands  increasing international growth by expanding into new markets primarily through license arrangements  extending our product lines into wellness and children s programs  and enhancing our multimedia platform community through new media opportunities  new membership programs  initiatives and acquisitions 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following to be critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on our financial presentation  and involve a higher degree of complexity  as they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments to us was impaired  additional allowances could be required 
we record allowances for product returns to be received in future periods at the time we recognize the original sale 
we base the amounts of the returns allowances upon historical experience and future expectations 
inventory inventory consists primarily of finished goods held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we identify the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition 
we write down discontinued or slow moving inventories based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through our current stock level of the inventories 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
our other intangibles mainly consist of customer and marketing related assets 
we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead we review it for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  on a reporting unit level 
we compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  we consider the goodwill of the reporting unit not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we perform the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss 
we have allocated goodwill to two reporting units  and we use a market value method for the purposes of testing for potential impairment 
the annual process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions could yield significantly different results 
investments we account for investments in limited liability companies in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence or control  or in which we hold a five percent or more membership interest  under the equity method 
we account for investments in corporations in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence or control  or in which we hold a twenty percent or more ownership  under the equity method 
under the equity method  we record our share of the income or losses of the investment by increasing or decreasing the carrying value of our investment and recording the income or expense through the consolidated statement of operations 
under the cost method of accounting  we carry investments in private companies at cost and adjust them only for other than temporary declines in fair value 
determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence or control over a company is highly subjective and requires a high degree of judgment 
purchase accounting we account for the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business using the purchase method 
in determining the estimated fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities  we make assumptions based upon many difference factors  such as historical and other relevant information and analysis performed by independent parties 
assumptions may be incomplete  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the validity of such assumptions  estimates  or actual results 
media library the media library asset represents the fair value of the library of produced videos acquired through business combinations  the purchase price of media rights to both video and audio titles  and the capitalized cost to produce media products  all of which we market to retailers and to direct mail and online customers 
we amortize the fair value of acquired or purchased media titles and content on a straight line basis over succeeding periods on the basis of their estimated useful lives 
we defer capitalized production costs for financial reporting purposes until the media is released and  then  we amortize these costs over succeeding periods on the basis of estimated sales 
historical sales statistics are the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate 
share based compensation as of january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation cost for share based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award on date of grant 
we measure compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize compensation cost upon the probable attainment of a specified performance condition or over a service period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value disclosures under sfas r 
in calculating this fair value  there are certain assumptions that we use  as disclosed in note  share based compensation  consisting of the expected life of the option  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and volatility 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
any borrowings we might make under our bank credit facility would bear interest at the lower of prime rate less basis points or libor plus basis points 
we do not have any amounts outstanding under our credit line  so any unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results from operations or cash flows unless we make borrowings in the future 
we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are primarily us dollar denominated transactions 
since the percentage of our international purchases denominated in currencies other than the us dollar is small  any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
however  a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could lead to increased purchasing costs 
in order to mitigate this exposure  we make virtually all of our purchase commitments in us dollars 
in  we purchased a interest in gaiam limited  formerly known as leisure systems international limited  a uk based distributor 
since gaiam limited s revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  this investment exposes us to accounting risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
however  we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of december  as a result of this investment
