garmin s fiscal year is a week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
fiscal year contained weeks compared to weeks for fiscal years    and unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to the company s fiscal year and fiscal periods 
unless the context otherwise requires  references in this document to we  us  our and similar terms refer to garmin ltd 
and its subsidiaries 
unless otherwise indicated  dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands  except per share data 
overview we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation  communications and information devices  most of which are enabled by global positioning system  or gps  technology 
we operate in four business segments  which serve the marine  outdoor fitness  automotive mobile  and aviation markets 
our segments offer products through our network of independent dealers and distributors 
however  the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly 
as such  the segments are managed separately 
our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine  recreation fitness and automotive mobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets 
our aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 
since our first products were delivered in  we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits 
our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of since and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of since the vast majority of this growth has been organic  only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of ups aviation technologies  inc in  motionbased technologies llc in  dynastream innovations inc in  digital cyclone  inc 
and the assets of nautamatic marine systems  inc in  and four european distributors in garmin france sas  garmin deutschland gmbh  garmin iberia sa  and garmin italia sa  these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years 
since our principal locations are in the united states  taiwan and the uk  we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results 
the functional currency of our european operations is the euro effective july and the functional currency of our asian operations is the new taiwan dollar 
approximately percent of transactions of our european operations are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro 
we experienced million  million  million  million  and million in foreign currency gains losses during fiscal years     and  respectively 
to date  we have not entered into hedging transactions with the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  or the new taiwan dollar  although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  garmin evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates  price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases  promotions and other volume based incentives 
the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin s operating results 
these incentives are reviewed periodically and  with the exceptions of price protection  are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis 
if market conditions were to decline  garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
warranties garmin s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
garmin s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventory garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investments investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
income taxes garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
while no valuation allowance has been recorded  it is garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
stock based compensation garmin distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights sars each year as part of garmin s compensation package for employees 
employees with certain levels of responsibility within garmin are eligible for stock option or sar grants  but the granting of options or sars is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation 
stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting terms and characteristics net sales our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers 
we recognize sales when title of the products passes to the customer 
our sales are largely of a consumer nature  therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results 
we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive  and we typically ship most orders within hours 
net sales are subject to some seasonal fluctuation 
typically  sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter  due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season  and in the fourth quarter  due to increased demand during the holiday buying season 
our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation  but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 
gross profit raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold 
in the first half of  we experienced favorable product mix and product pricing  which allowed us to hold margins in our automotive mobile segment steady  margin declines in the second half of were primarily a result of average selling price declines  coupled with raw materials price increases  most notably the costs for flash memory  in late second quarter and through the third quarter of when we were purchasing these components for our holiday production runs  resulting in margin declines as these components were sold  primarily in the fourth quarter of in the first half of  we experienced meaningful price declines on flash memory and color screens  which allowed us to hold margins in our automotive mobile segment steady in the face of price declines  and allowed us to improve margins in other business segments as well 
while these price declines did not continue throughout all of  we did have additional component cost reductions as we neared year end 
in we experienced a shift in product mix to lower margin product groups  which continued in  and price declines related to increased competition  both in relation to the rapidly growing automotive navigation product line 
our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and  where possible  to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components 
we believe that because of our practice of performing the design  manufacture and marketing of our products in house  our shijr  taiwan  jhongli  taiwan  lin kou  taiwan  olathe  kansas  and salem  oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing 
in general  products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products 
our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 
sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit 
in the past  prices of our devices sold into the automotive mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points 
the average selling prices of our aviation products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices 
the effect of the sales price variability inherent within the mix of gps enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel  advertising  marketing  and other brand building costs  accounting and legal costs  information systems and infrastructure costs  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
with the expected increase of total revenues in the future  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
we intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus on individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer marketplace  especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand opportunities in rapidly growing markets like portable automobile navigation  which is becoming a mass market 
we also intend to increase our customer call center support as our business continues to grow 
we also anticipate increased selling  general  and administrative costs associated with information technology staffing and support activities 
research and development the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers  costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development  and costs of test equipment needed during product development 
approximately of the research and development of our products is performed in the united states 
the remainder of our research and development activities are performed by our taiwan engineering group  which has increased in size in recent years 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gps enabled devices 
we continue to grow our research and development budget in absolute terms 
customers no customer accounted for or more of our sales in the year ended december  our top ten customers have contributed between and of net sales since we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between and days since we have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix and longer payment terms  and anticipate maintaining approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going forward 
income taxes we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates 
in particular  lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain high technology capital investments  and other taiwan tax credits due to repatriation of earnings have continued to reduce our tax rate there 
therefore  profits earned in taiwan have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states and europe 
as a result  our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately during we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through the current taiwan tax incentives for which garmin has received approval will end in we plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond based on capital investments we expect to make in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply 
management also believes that the revenue shift to our lower tax rate corporate entities will continue  however certain tax credits will not be available in  so the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the production volume  additional capital investments made during fiscal  and the composition of our earnings

the aviation  marine  and outdoor fitness segments also experienced solid growth in total units sold increased to  in from  in in general  management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth 
the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of many new automotive  outdoor fitness  and marine products  strong demand for our automotive products  and solid demand for our aviation  marine  and outdoor fitness products 
it is management s belief that the continued demand for the company s automotive products is due to overall increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of gps  particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation 
additionally  the expansion of the gps market in general  as well as enhanced feature sets in our products specifically  have added to our growth 
innovative new product offerings  enhanced cartography  rich feature sets  and products featuring high sensitivity gps capabilities increased sales of our marine and outdoor fitness segments 
the increase in aviation sales for fiscal was primarily due to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the oem original equipment manufacturers and retrofit markets 
sales of the g integrated glass cockpit were the primary reason for increased oem sales in while temporary flight restrictions tfr s continue to impact general aviation  the flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers 
should the faa impose more restrictions  or elect to shutdown us airspace in the future  these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
gross profit fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  year over year gross profit of revenues gross profit of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoor fitness products 
the reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the strong growth experienced in our lower margin automotive mobile product line  offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments 
notably gross margin in our automotive mobile segment did not fall as much as anticipated due to volume discounts on certain components  less price competition than anticipated  and new premium feature rich products with higher selling prices and margins 
management believes that the trend to lower gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a faster rate than the other business segments 
the rise in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our oem and retrofit products 
the decline in gross margin in the outdoor fitness and marine segments was primarily due to a shift in product mix

management expects that because of strong demand for our products  selling  general and administrative expenses will rise in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of sales during fiscal as increased advertising and marketing activities build awareness of the garmin brand and demand for garmin products worldwide 
research and development expenses fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  year over year research development of revenues research development of revenues change change outdoor fitness marine automotive mobile aviation total the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the addition of over associates to our research and development team during fiscal management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of garmin is continuous innovation  development  and introduction of new products 
management expects that its research and development expenses will increase approximately during fiscal on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong portfolio of new products slated for fiscal management expects to continue to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain garmin s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes 
other income expense fiscal year ended fiscal year ended december  december  interest income interest expense foreign currency gain other total other income expense principally consists of interest income  interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income expense was higher in fiscal relative to fiscal  with the majority of this difference caused by increased interest income and a large foreign currency gain in interest income for fiscal increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances during the year  increasing the returns on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
foreign currency gains and losses for the company in were primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar  the euro  and the british pound sterling 
the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe ltd 
the euro dollar is the functional currency of garmin france  garmin deutschland  garmin iberia  and garmin italia 
as these entities grow  euro currency moves will generate material gains and losses 
additionally  euro based inter company transactions between garmin ltd 
and its subsidiaries can also generate currency gains and losses 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of dynastream innovations  inc  due to this entity s relative size  its currency moves do not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the majority of the million currency gain in fiscal was due to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound sterling 
during fiscal  the taiwan dollar weakened relative to the us dollar  resulting in a million loss 
the british pound sterling and the euro strengthened and respectively  relative to the us dollar during fiscal  which resulted in a million gain

total units sold increased to  in from  in garmin s revenues are normally seasonal  with the fiscal second and fourth quarter revenues being meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters 
in revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern  with increases each quarter over the prior year s quarter due to the impact of new product releases across all product lines 
the revenue increase in the second quarter was primarily attributable to sell in of popular new portable automobile navigation and outdoor fitness products and father s day graduation purchases 
the revenue increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to late summer new product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling season 
the increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of many new automotive  outdoor fitness  and marine products and overall demand for our automotive and outdoor fitness products

we operate with a customer oriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand 
because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and minimize order fulfillment time  our inventory levels are generally substantial enough to meet most demand 
we also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products 
we began implementing a more linear inventory management strategy in the fourth quarter of which management would anticipate will result in less inventory fluctuation from quarter to quarter going forward 
we prefer to have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products 
raw materials and finished goods inventory levels continued to grow year over year as a function of our growing sales 
we anticipate days of inventory to stabilize at current levels in although absolute dollars of inventory will continue to rise  reflecting the growth of our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials 
product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions 
historically  during cyclical industry downturns  we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
we generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the taiwan dollar  the euro and british pound have proven to be relatively stable 
however  periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar 
the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the currencies that create a majority of the company s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar  the euro  and british pound 
garmin corporation  located in shijr  taiwan  uses the local currency as the functional currency 
the company translates all assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year 
in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets  we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 
the ntd usd exchange rate decreased during  which resulted in a cumulative translation adjustment of negative million at the end of fiscal and a net foreign currency loss of million at garmin corporation during garmin france sas  garmin deutschland gmbh  garmin italia spa  and garmin iberia sa  located in france  germany  italy  and spain respectively  use the euro as the functional currency 
however  the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary  garmin europe ltd 
remains the us dollar  and as some transactions occurred in british pounds or euros  foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar 
the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows 
in  the euro strengthened relative to the us dollar and the british pound sterling strengthened relative to the us dollar 
these currency moves resulted in a foreign currency gain of million in garmin ltd 
and our european subsidiaries 
these gains were offset by currency moves in the taiwan dollar that generated losses described above  combined with other losses of million  and the timing of transactions during the year for a net gain of million for the company 
if the td usd exchange rate had decreased and the gbp usd and eur usd exchange rate had each increased in  the cumulative translation adjustment would have been a negative million at the end of fiscal and the foreign currency loss would have been million without the use of any hedging strategies 
interest rate risk we have no outstanding long term debt as of december  we  therefore  have no meaningful debt related interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities 
as interest rates change  the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 
a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses 
at december   cumulative unrealized gains on those securities were million 
equity price risk we are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities  which had an estimated fair value of million at december  and million at december  we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of the equity investment exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
generally  we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities 
we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of million at december  and million at december
