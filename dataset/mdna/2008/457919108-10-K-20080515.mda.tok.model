item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the trust is engaged in the ownership and operation of hotel properties 
at january   the innsuites system included five moderate and full service hotels with hotel suites 
four of our hotels are branded through franchise agreements with best western 
all five hotels are trademarked as innsuites hotels 
we are also involved in various operations incidental to the operation of hotels  such as the operation of restaurants and meeting banquet room rentals 
our operations consist of one reportable segment  hotel ownership  which derives its revenue from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  we receive management fees  trademark license fees and reservation fees 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
improved economic conditions  both generally and specifically in the travel industry  had a positive impact on the operations of the trust in fiscal years and we anticipate the positive trend in the travel industry to continue well into calendar year better overall economic conditions are expected to result in increased business and leisure travel and support higher room rates  and therefore higher operating margins 
we expect the major challenge for fiscal year to be strong competition for group business in the markets in which we operate that may affect the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
we believe that we have positioned the hotels to remain competitive through selective refurbishment and carrying a relatively large number of two room suites at each location 
while the downturn in the economy did not significantly affect the hospitality industry during fiscal year  the trust believes that it is prepared for such an event by continuing to maintain tight costs controls and high labor efficiency throughout fiscal year hotel properties held for sale the trust classified its five hotels as held for sale as of august   which is part of the trust s long term strategic plan to migrate the focus of the trust from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company by expanding its trademark license  management  reservation and advertising services 
this plan is similar to strategies followed by international diversified hotel industry leaders  which over the last several years have been reducing real estate holdings and concentrating on hospitality services 
the trust began its long term corporate strategy when it relinquished its reit status in january  which prevented the trust from providing hospitality services to hotels 
then  in june  the trust acquired its trademark license and management agreements and began providing services to its hotels 
on july   the board of trustees voted to list and or present for sale all five of the trust s hotel properties 
the sale of the hotels will provide the trust with additional capital  some of which will be needed to complete the transformation to a hospitality service company following the lead of other hotel chains 
proceeds from the sale of the hotels will be used as needed to support hospitality service operations as cash flows from current operations  primarily the sale of hotel rooms  declines with sale of the hotels 
with the acquisition of additional contracts for services and the reduction of expenses in other areas  additional capital from the sale of the hotels will be marginal 
the trust estimates that the transformation to a hospitality service company will add approximately  in salary and travel expenses to its current annual administrative expenses  partially offset over time by a reduction in operations 
the additional expense is for sales personnel to market trademark license  management  reservation  and advertising services 
initially  the trust will focus its sales efforts in the western region of the united states and concentrate its marketing efforts on unbranded hotels and hotels that are changing brands 
the trust expects the fees for its trademark license and management services to range from to of room revenue depending on the services provided 
in addition to the trademark license and management services  advertising services will be required at a fee ranging from to of room revenue 
reservation fees are expected to range from to per reservation depending on the number of room nights included in the reservation 
each hotel will also be expected to sign up with an independent global distribution system to receive domestic and international reservations from travel agents  airlines and the internet reservation services 
the trust has listed all of its properties for sale 
our sales efforts were slowed by sub prime finance concerns but have recently picked up as a result of lower prime rates 
we have received several offers 
no earnest money has been received and we have not entered into any definitive or binding agreements to sell any of the properties as of the date of this report 
effective february   the trust relinquished its reit status 
as of that date  any distributions to its shareholders are not deductible for purposes of computing the trust s taxable income and the trust will be subject to income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  without offset for distributions of such income to its shareholders 
as of january   the trust has million in federal net loss carryforward available to offset future federal tax liability 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project hotel cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available or the present value of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below 
at january  and  the trust owned a and  respectively  interest in four of the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership and owned a interest in one hotel 
the trust purchased  and  partnership units during the years ended january  and  respectively 
the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  which is calculated as rooms sold divided by total rooms available  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the hotels 
occupancy decreased to from in the prior year 
adr increased by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  which resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  overview a summary of operating results for the fiscal years ended january  and is change change revenue operating income net income loss income loss per share basic income loss per share diluted the trust s overall results in were positively affected by the positive results from increased rate management efforts as well as the suspension of depreciation of assets held for sale as discussed below 
for the twelve months ended january   the trust had total revenue of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   an increase of approximately  this increase in total revenue is primarily due to increased rates at the hotels resulting in increased room revenues  partially offset by reduced payroll reimbursements due to the termination of the management contract with the san diego  california property during the third quarter of fiscal year total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  reflect a decrease of approximately million compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in depreciation expenses due to the suspension of depreciation on assets held for sale as of august  and reduced payroll expenses due to the termination of the management contract with the san diego  california property 
for the twelve months ended january   the trust disposed of the furniture  fixtures and equipment previously used in the operation of the san diego  california property for a gain of  the trust had no such disposition activity in fiscal year general and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management  accounting  shareholder and legal services for the trust 
general and administrative expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  was consistent with the prior year total 
total operating expenses for the twelve months ended january  were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in depreciation expenses due to the suspension of depreciation on assets held for sale as of august  and reduced payroll expenses due to the termination of the management contract with the san diego  california property 
total interest expense for the twelve months ended january  was million  consistent with the prior year total 
interest on mortgage notes payable for the twelve months ended january  was million  a decrease of  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease is primarily due to reduced mortgage balances and a reduced rate on the tucson st 
mary s variable rate note 
interest on notes payable to banks increased  or over  to  from  during the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase is due to the line of credit secured by the tucson st 
mary s property that was funded during the first quarter of fiscal year hotel property depreciation for the twelve months ended january  was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million in the twelve months ended january  the decrease was primarily due to the suspension of depreciation on the hotel properties  which were reclassified as held for sale at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year the reduction in depreciation expense is the single most significant matter that increased profitability for the year ended january  the trust had income before minority interest and income taxes of million for the twelve months ended january   compared to a loss of  in the prior year 
after deducting the loss allocated to the minority interest of  and taxes of  the trust had net income attributable to shares of beneficial interest of approximately million for fiscal year this represented an increase of approximately million in net income loss attributable to shares of beneficial interest comparing the twelve months ended january  and basic and diluted net income per share was and  respectively  for the twelve months ended january   compared to a basic and diluted net loss per share of for the change since the prior year is partially attributable to placing assets as held for sale and  as a result  ceasing depreciation as of august  depreciation expense decreased by approximately m in the current year of which  approximately  is attributable to shares of beneficial interest 
liquidity and capital resources overview the trust s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow and its direct ownership of the yuma  arizona property 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is hotel operations for the four hotel properties it owns 
the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of itself and the partnership to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
hotel operations are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates at the hotels  which have improved over the prior three fiscal years  our ability to manage costs  and changes in the number of available suites caused by acquisition and disposition activities 
results are also significantly impacted by overall economic conditions and conditions in the travel industry 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing  which would reduce our profit margins on rented suites 
we anticipate a slowing of the overall economic conditions that could result in increased competition for business and leisure travel and that may not support the higher room rates of fiscal  and therefore could lower operating margins 
challenges in fiscal year are expected to include continued competition for group business in the markets in which we operate and the trust s ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to the aggressive reduction of the trust s payables during the year 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was due to reduced spending on capital improvements 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  and  for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increases year to year were primarily due to increased bank borrowings 
the trust received  in proceeds from the sale of the furniture  fixtures and equipment at the san diego  california property in fiscal year the trust had no such sales in fiscal year as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements that is set aside annually  as described below 
the trust continues to contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund an amount equal to of the innsuites hotels revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is restricted by the mortgage lender for four of the trust s properties 
as of january    was held in these accounts and is reported on the trust s consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during the twelve months ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately  and million  respectively  for capital expenditures 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts were capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives until they were classified as held for sale at august  the trust plans to spend approximately  for capital expenditures in fiscal year the hotels also spent approximately and million during fiscal years and  respectively  on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
the trust has minimum debt payments of million and million due during fiscal years and  respectively 
the trust plans to renew its bank line of credit when it matures during fiscal year the trust believes it can satisfy its remaining obligations during fiscal years and using revenue generated by the hotels operations 
management believes that cash on hand  future cash receipts from operations  and borrowings from affiliates in fiscal year will be sufficient to meet the trust s obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
the trust may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
future positioning the board of trustees in viewing the hotel industry cycles determined that may be a high point of the current hotel industry cycle and further determined it was appropriate to classify the five hotels owned by the trust as held for sale 
the trust is now actively seeking buyers for its properties 
the trust has engaged the services of several hotel brokers and is independently advertising its hotels for sale 
the trust s long term strategic plan is to obtain full benefit of its real estate equity to migrate the focus of the trust from a hotel owner to a hospitality service company by expanding its trademark license  management  reservation  and advertising services 
this plan is similar to strategies followed by international diversified hotel industry leaders  which over the last several years have reduced real estate holdings and concentrated on hospitality services 
the trust began its long term corporate strategy when it relinquished its reit status in january  which had previously prevented the trust from providing management services to hotels 
in june  the trust acquired its trademark license and management agreements and began providing management  trademark and reservations services to its hotels 
in july  the board of trustees voted to list and or present for sale all five of the trust s hotel properties based on substantial equity not readily seen by investors or then reflected in stock prices 
the table below lists the hotel properties  their respective carrying and mortgage value and the estimated sales value for the hotel properties 
hotel property asset values as of january  hotel property book value mortgage balance sales price albuquerque ontario tucson oracle tucson city center yuma totals there is no assurance that the listed sales price for the individual hotel properties will be realized  however the trust s management believes that these sales prices are reasonable based on local market conditions and comparable sales 
changes in market conditions have in part and may in the future result in the trust changing one or all of the sales prices 
the trust provides trademark licensing  management  reservation and advertising services to all the hotel properties listed above and expects to continue the trademark licensing services  which include the reservation and advertising services  and or continue the management services  which also includes the reservation and advertising services  after the hotels are sold 
the trust believes either of these services provides the trust with the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of these hotels 
if any or all of these hotel properties are sold  the trust s future management and or licensing fees could be reduced if the purchaser did not continue to retain innsuites hotels to provide those services 
in the past  when the trust has sold hotel properties to unrelated third parties  the trust has continued to provide management and or trademark licensing services after a sale  although there can be no assurance that the trust will be able to successfully do so in the future 
as part of the board study for  greater emphasis has been placed on priority for additional management  trademark and reservations fee income 
the trust has determined that it is easier to sell management contracts when the trademark services are also provided 
therefore the primary emphasis is on trademark and reservation services 
as part of the emphasis on trademark services  the trust is developing two trademark packages 
the first is the traditional innsuites hotels suites regional package and the second is the innsuites boutique collection  which now includes two affiliate hotels managed by the trust 
the trust plans to add two additional affiliate hotels to the boutique collection 
marketing of our new products is being handled by a third party vendor  while sales are being handled internally 
share repurchase program on january   the board of trustees approved a share repurchase program under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  for the purchase of up to  limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  on september   august  and september   the board of trustees approved the purchase of up to  additional limited partnership units in the partnership and or shares of beneficial interest in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
acquired shares of beneficial interest will be held in treasury and will be available for future acquisitions and financings and or for awards granted under the innsuites hospitality trust stock incentive and option plan 
during fiscal year  the trust acquired  shares of beneficial interest in open market transactions at an average price of per share and  shares of beneficial interest in privately negotiated transactions at an average price of 
the trust intends to continue repurchasing shares of beneficial interest in compliance with applicable legal and american stock exchange requirements 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business and employment contracts for key employees  the trust does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities 
the trust does not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting matters below for a discussion of new accounting interpretations with respect to variable interest entities and the impact of such interpretations on the trust 
critical accounting policies and estimates the trust believes that the policies it follows for the valuation of its hotel properties  which constitute the majority of trust assets  are its most critical policies 
the trust applies sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine when it is necessary to test an asset for recoverability 
on an events and circumstances basis  the trust reviews the carrying value of its hotel properties both held for use and held for sale 
the trust will record an impairment loss and reduce the carrying value of a property when anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and or a current appraisal of the property do not support its carrying value 
in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for use  it will reduce the carrying value to the fair value of the hotel  as determined by a current appraisal 
in cases where the trust does not expect to recover the carrying cost of hotel properties held for sale  it will reduce the carrying value to the sales price less costs to sell 
the trust did not recognize impairment expense in fiscal years or as of january   the trust management does not believe that the carrying values of any of its hotel properties are impaired

the trust s assessments of its tax positions in accordance with fin did not result in changes that had a material impact on results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

inflation the trust s revenue is based on the underlying hotel revenue 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general and innsuites hotels in particular can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates faster than inflation
