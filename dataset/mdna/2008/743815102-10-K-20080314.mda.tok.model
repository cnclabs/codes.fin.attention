item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
cpsa monitors our service encounter value based upon data submitted by us electronically 
if our service encounter value exceeds amounts paid to us under this contract equal to one twelfth of the annual contract amount on a monthly basis  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
if our encounter value is not sufficient to support year to date payments made to us or if we fail to provide data sufficient to permit accurate monitoring of our service encounter value to the extent not waived  cpsa can suspend payments to us or prospectively recoup funds 
cpsa has not suspended payments to us 
while we do not anticipate that cpsa will prospectively recoup funds  and while we believe that our service encounter value is sufficient to support all amounts paid to us under the contract  there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and business 
our contracts are not only short term in nature but can also be terminated prior to expiration  without cause and without penalty to the payers  and there can be no assurance that they will survive until the end of their stated terms or that upon their expiration these contracts will be renewed or extended 
most of our contracts contain base periods of only one year 
while some of them also contain options for renewal  usually successive six month or one year terms  payers are not required to extend their contracts into these option periods 
in addition  a significant number of our social services contracts not only allow the payer to terminate the contract immediately for cause such as for our failure to meet our contract obligations but also permit the payer to terminate the contract at any time prior to its stated expiration date 
in most cases the payer may terminate the social services contract without cause  at will and without penalty to the payer  either upon the expiration of a short notice period  typically days  and or immediately  in the event federal or state appropriations supporting the programs serviced by the contract are reduced or eliminated 
in the case of our non emergency transportation services contracts  these contracts are only cancellable for performance after notice and a cure period that typically ranges from days to days in length 
the failure of payers to renew or extend significant contracts or their early termination of significant contracts could adversely affect our financial performance 
we cannot anticipate if  when or to what extent a payer might terminate its contract with us prior to its expiration or fail to renew or extend its contract with us 

table of contents each of our contracts is subject to audit and modification by the payers with whom we contract  in their sole discretion 
our business depends on our ability to successfully perform under various government funded contracts 
the payers under these contracts can review our performance under these contracts  as well as our records  accounting and general business practices at any time and may  in their discretion suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts because of violations or suspected violations of procurement laws or regulations  terminate or modify our existing contracts  reduce the amount we are paid under our existing contracts  and or audit and object to our contract related fees 
as a government contractor  we are subject to an increased risk of litigation and other legal actions and liabilities 
as a government contractor  we are subject to an increased risk of investigation  criminal prosecution  civil fraud  whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities not often faced by companies that do not provide government sponsored services 
the occurrence of any of these actions  regardless of the outcome  could disrupt our operations and cause us added expense and could limit our ability to obtain additional contracts in other jurisdictions 
a loss of our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction could result in the termination of a number of our contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
if we lost our status as a licensed provider in any jurisdiction  the contracts under which we provide services in that jurisdiction would be subject to termination 
moreover  such an event could constitute a violation of provisions of our contracts in other jurisdictions  resulting in further contract terminations 
if we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations  we could be liable for damages and financial penalties and harm our ability to keep our existing contracts or obtain new contracts 
our failure to comply with our contract obligations could  in addition to providing grounds for immediate termination of the contract for cause  negatively impact our financial performance and damage our reputation  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain new contracts 
our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
the termination of a contract for cause could  for instance  subject us to liability for excess costs incurred by a payer in obtaining similar services from another source 
in addition  our contracts require us to indemnify payers for our failure to meet standards of care  and some of them contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties that we must pay if we breach these contracts 
if we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts  we may incur losses on these contracts 
under our fee for service contracts  we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients 
to earn a profit on these contracts  we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services 
our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs  such as rent and other overhead 
our fee for service contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore  if we fail to estimate our costs accurately  we may incur losses on these contracts 
additionally  approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts with the remainder generated through fee for service and fixed cost contracts 
under our 
table of contents capitated contracts  we assume the responsibility of managing the needs of a specific geographic population by contracting out transportation services to local van  cab and ambulance companies on a per ride or per mile basis 
we use a pricing model to determine applicable contract rates  which take into account factors  such as estimated utilization  state specific data  previous experience in the state and or with similar services  estimated volume and availability of mass transit 
the amount of the fixed monthly per member per month fee is determined in the bidding process but predicated on actual historical transportation data for the subject geographic region provided by the payer  actuarial work performed in house as well as by third party actuarial firms and actuarial analyses provided by the payer 
if the utilization of our services is more than we estimated  the contract may not be profitable 
approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from cost based service contracts in california for which we record revenue at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies  which puts us at risk that we may be required to subsequently refund a portion of the excess funds  if any 
our cost based service contracts require us to allow for contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or an insufficient number of encounters 
for the year ended december  and  revenues from these contracts represented approximately and of our total revenues for the respective period 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under the contracts  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our results of operations will fluctuate due to seasonality 
our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons and our non emergency transportation services during the holiday and winter seasons 
our expenses related to our social services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses may not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
conversely  due to the fixed revenue stream and variable expense base structure of our net services operating segment  expenses related to this segment do vary with these changes and  as a result  such expenses fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non emergency transportation services 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response to our entry by other social services and transportation managers or providers 
while we obtain some of our business through responses to government requests for proposals  we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future  and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable 
we obtain  and will continue to seek to obtain  a significant portion of our business from state or local government entities 
to obtain business from government entities  we are often required to respond to requests for proposals  or rfps 
to propose effectively  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors 
we must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables 
our ability to respond successfully to rfps will greatly impact our business 
we may not be awarded contracts through the rfp process  and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies  we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government sponsored contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
to facilitate our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships 
table of contents enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an rfp or program for privatization of social services and enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers 
the effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions 
we also may lose key personnel who have these relationships 
we may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees 
any failure to establish  maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts 
the federal government may refuse to grant consents and or waivers necessary to permit for profit entities to perform certain elements of government programs 
under current law  in order to privatize certain functions of government programs  the federal government must grant a consent and or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency 
if the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver or withdraw approval of any granted waiver  the state or local agency will be unable to contract with a for profit entity  such as us  to provide service 
failure by state or local agencies to obtain consents and or waivers could adversely affect our continued business and future growth 
our business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of social services 
the market for our services depends largely on federal  state and local legislative programs 
these programs can be modified or amended at any time 
moreover  part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by the federal  state and local initiatives to privatize the delivery of social services 
however  there are opponents to the privatization of social services and  as a result  future privatization of social services is uncertain 
if additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted  or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged  repealed or invalidated  our growth could be adversely impacted 
our strategic relationships with certain not for profit and tax exempt entities are subject to tax and other risks 
since some government agencies in certain of our markets prefer or require contracts for privatized social services to be administered through not for profit organizations  we rely on our long term relationships with not for profit organizations to provide services to these government agencies 
we currently maintain strategic relationships with not for profit social services organizations with which we have management contracts of varying lengths  of which are federally tax exempt organizations 
our strategic relationships with tax exempt not for profit organizations are similar to those in the hospital management industry where tax exempt or faith based not for profit hospitals are managed by for profit companies 
federal tax law requires that the boards of directors of not for profit tax exempt organizations be independent 
the boards of directors of the tax exempt not for profit organizations for which we provide management services have a majority of independent members 
the board members are predominately selected from independent members of the local community in which the not for profit entity operates 
decisions regarding our business relationships with these not for profit entities are made by their independent board members including approving the management fees we charge to manage their organizations and any discretionary bonuses 
federal tax law also requires that the management fees we charge the not for profit entities we manage be fixed and at fair market rates 
typically a fairness opinion is obtained by the not for profit entities we manage from an independent third party valuation consultant that substantiates the fair market rates 
if the internal revenue service determined that any tax exempt organization was paying more than market rates for services performed by us  the managed entity could lose its tax exempt status and owe back taxes and penalties 

table of contents generally  under state law  not for profit entities may pay no more than reasonable compensation for services rendered 
if the compensation paid to us by these not for profit entities is deemed unreasonable  then the state could take action against the not for profit entity which could adversely affect us 
government unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us  which could limit our market opportunities 
our success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees 
many government employees  however  belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks 
these unions could apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs 
union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts 
the media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we provide to clients 
this media coverage  if negative  could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing government services 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts 
we may incur costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner 
moreover  any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner 
our business is subject to risks of litigation 
we are in the human and non emergency transportation services businesses which are subject to lawsuits and claims 
a substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flow and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance 
we can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct in addition to professional liability type claims by an employee  including but not limited to  claims arising out of accidents involving vehicle collisions  employees driving to or from interactions with clients or assault and battery 
we are also subject to claims alleging we did not properly treat an individual or failed to properly diagnose and or care for a client 
we can be subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment law and permitting issues 
while we are insured for these types of claims  damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage  such as a claim for fraud  could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition 
furthermore  we can be subject to miscellaneous errors and omissions liability relative to the various management agreements we have with the not for profit entities we manage 
in the event of a claim and depending on  among other things  the circumstances  allegations  and size of the management contract  we could be subject to damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our use of a reinsurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business 
we are self insured with regard to a substantial portion of our general liability  professional liability  workers compensation insurance and automobile liability 
we also reinsure the general liability  professional 
table of contents liability  workers compensation insurance  and automobile liability of certain designated entities affiliated with us or independent third parties under reinsurance programs through our two wholly owned captive insurance subsidiaries 
in the event that actual reinsured losses increase unexpectedly or exceed actuarially determined estimated reinsured losses under the program  the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  as the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in cost  we will continue to evaluate the levels and types of insurance we include in our self insurance program 
any increase to this program increases our risk exposure and therefore increases the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
we could be subject to significant state regulation and potential sanctions if our health care benefits program is deemed to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement 
for the purpose of managing and providing employee healthcare benefits we deem ourselves to be a single employer under section of erisa with regard to our own employees as well as the employees of certain of our managed entities covered by our healthcare benefit program to whom we offered healthcare benefits through june the department of labor or individual states could disagree with our interpretation and consider our program to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement  or mewa  and  as such  subject to regulation by state insurance commissions 
if involuntarily deemed a mewa  our cost to manage the state by state regulatory environment for the self funded portion of our health insurance program would be prohibitive and we could  as a result  elect to maintain our self funded health insurance plan only for our owned entities  forcing the three managed entities currently included in our self funded plan to negotiate and purchase their own health benefits 
in addition  if our health care benefits program is determined to be a mewa  civil and or criminal sanctions are possible 
we face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced professionals  particularly social service professionals with respect to our social services and intellectual technology professionals with respect to our non emergency transportation services  and we may be unable to grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees 
our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced social services professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality services to our clients 
our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is strongly considered when we evaluate education  experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff 
to that end  we attempt to hire professionals who have attained a bachelor s degree  master s degree or higher level of education and certification or licensure as direct care social services providers and administrators 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we must quickly hire project leaders and case management personnel after a contract is awarded to us 
contract provisions and client needs determine the number  education and experience levels of social services professionals we hire 
we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract 
our performance in our non emergency transportation services business largely depends on the talents and efforts of our highly skilled intellectual technology professionals 
competition for skilled intellectual technology professionals can be intense 
our success depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate these individuals 
our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to offer competitive wages  benefits and professional growth opportunities 
some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
the inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
since  our business has grown significantly in size and complexity 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our management  systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
in addition  we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
the nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
any acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that we will continue making strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have made a number of acquisitions since our inception  including twenty since our initial public offering in august the success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations 
there can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the same historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions  that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies contracts  that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies  or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services  expand our markets or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with our acquisition strategy  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership and or we could incur or assume substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following problems assimilating the purchased operations  unanticipated costs and legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  the incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition  failure to maintain and renew contracts  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition  and dilution to our earnings per share 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 
changes in the accounting method for business combinations may have an adverse impact on our reported or future financial results 
currently and for the years ended december  and prior  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard business combinations  or sfas  all acquisition related costs such as attorney s fees and accountant s fees  as well as contingent consideration to the seller  are capitalized as part of the purchase price 

table of contents in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which requires an acquirer to do the following expense acquisition related costs as incurred  record contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes in fair value to be recognized in the income statement  and recognize any adjustments to the purchase price allocation as a period cost in the income statement 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier application is prohibited 
at the date of adoption  sfas r may have a material impact on our results of operations and our financial position due to our acquisition strategy 
our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace 
in our social services business  we compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
most of our competition consists of local social services organizations that compete with us for local contracts such as united way supported agencies and faith based agencies such as catholic social services  jewish family and children s services and the salvation army 
other competitors include local not for profit organizations and community based organizations 
historically  these types of organizations have been favored in our industry as incumbent providers of services to government entities 
we also compete with larger companies  such as res care  inc  which provides support services  training and educational programs predominantly to medicaid eligible beneficiaries 
national mentor  inc is the country s largest provider of foster care services and competes with us in existing markets for foster care services 
in addition  many institutional providers offer some type of community based care including such organizations as cornell companies  inc  psychiatric solutions  inc 
and the devereaux foundation 
some of these companies have greater financial  technical  political  marketing  name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients and or payers than we do 
in addition  some of these companies offer more services than we do 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  competition from new entrants into the markets in which we operate our social services business 
increased competition may result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 
we compete with a variety of organizations that provide similar non emergency transportation services to medicaid eligible beneficiaries in local markets such as american medical response  coordinated transportation solutions  inc  first transit  inc  medical transportation management inc  mv transportation  inc  and southeast trans 
our competitors largely compete for smaller scale contract opportunities that encompass smaller geographic areas 
for example  most of our competitors seek to win contracts for specific counties  whereas we seek to win contracts for the entire state 
if these competitors begin to compete on a larger scale basis  it could result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 
our business is subject to state licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions  including regulatory provisions governing surveys  audits  anti kickbacks  self referrals  false claims and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and changes to or violations of these regulations could negatively impact our revenues 
in many of the locations where we operate  we are required by state law to obtain and maintain licenses 
the applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide  the credentials of staff  record keeping  treatment planning  client monitoring and supervision of staff 
the failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction 
most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers 
we are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations 
such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers 
in addition  we are or may be subject to anti kickback  self referral and false claim laws 
violations of these laws may result in significant penalties  including repayment of any amounts alleged to be overpayments or in violation of such laws  criminal 
table of contents fines  civil money penalties  damages  imprisonment  a ban from participation in federally funded healthcare programs and or bans from obtaining government contracts 
such fines and other penalties could negatively impact our business by decreasing profits due to repayment of overpayments or from the imposition of fines and damages  damaging our reputation and diverting our management resources 
due to our access  use or disclosure of health information relating to individuals  we are subject to the privacy mandates of hipaa 
hipaa mandates  among other things  the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the nation s healthcare system 
hipaa requires the united states department of health and human services  or dhhs  to adopt standards for electronic transactions and code sets for basic healthcare transactions such as payment  eligibility and remittance advices  or transaction standards  privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy standards  security of individually identifiable health information  or security standards  electronic signatures  as well as unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals and enforcement 
final regulations have been issued by dhhs for the privacy standards  and some of the transaction standards and security standards 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply in our operations with these standards as applicable and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 
in addition  in connection with providing services to customers that also are healthcare providers  we are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to those customers that we will provide those services in accordance with the privacy standards and security standards 
hipaa has and will require significant and costly changes for our company and others in the healthcare industry 
compliance with the privacy standards became mandatory in april  compliance with the transaction standards became mandatory in october although full implementation was delayed with respect to the medicare program until october  and compliance with the security standards became mandatory in april in february  dhhs published its final rule on enforcement of the hipaa administrative simplification provisions  including the transaction standards  the security standards and the privacy rule 
this enforcement rule addresses  among other issues  dhhs s policies for determining violations and calculating civil money penalties  how dhhs will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties  and various procedural issues 
we have appointed an internal committee to maintain our privacy and security policies regarding client information in compliance with hipaa 
this committee is responsible for training our employees  including our regional and local managers and staff  to comply with hipaa and monitoring compliance with the policy 
however  like other businesses subject to hipaa regulations  we cannot fully predict the total financial or other impact of these regulations on us 
the costs associated with our ongoing compliance could be substantial  which could negatively impact our profitability 
our international operations expose us to various risks  any number of which could harm our business 
as a result of our acquisition of wcg on august   we now have operations in canada 
we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries  any one of which could adversely impact our business 
in addition to currency fluctuations  these risks include  among other things economic downturns  changes in or interpretations of local law  governmental policy or regulation  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the country  varying tax systems  delays from doing business with governmental agencies  nationalization of foreign assets  and government protectionism 

table of contents we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to establish new operations in canada 
one or more of the foregoing factors could impair our current or future operations and  as a result  harm our overall business 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and we are taxable in most of them and face the risk of double taxation if one jurisdiction does not acquiesce to the tax claims of another jurisdiction 
we currently operate in the united states and canada and are subject to income taxes in those countries and the specific states and or provinces where we operate 
in the event one taxing jurisdiction disagrees with another taxing jurisdiction  we could experience temporary or permanent double taxation and increased professional fees to resolve taxation matters

overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage  and we arrange for and manage non emergency transportation services 
as a result of and in response to the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services and non emergency transportation services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have grown both organically and by consummating strategic acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy we have expanded our in home counseling  school based services and workforce development service offerings and entered into the non emergency transportation management services market through several acquisitions which were completed in on august   as discussed below  we began offering our services in canada as a result of an acquisition 
additionally  effective december   we operate in two segments as a result of our entering into the non emergency transportation management services market through an acquisition as described below 
our goal is to be the primary provider of 
table of contents choice to the social services industry 
focusing on our core competencies in the delivery of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit managed services while adding other supporting social services such as non emergency transportation management services to our service offerings  we believe we are well positioned to offer the highest quality of service to our clients and provide a viable alternative to state and local governments current service delivery systems 
as of december   we provided social services directly and through the entities we manage to over  clients  and had million individuals eligible to receive services under our non emergency transportation services contracts 
we provided services to these clients from locations in states  the district of columbia and british columbia 
our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facility with cit capital securities llc  or cit  which provides funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business grows internally through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or our managed entities are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we also pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions have generally been accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage by expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 
in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees and the amount of outsourced transportation cost as these items are our most important variable costs and the key to the management of our operating margins 
acquisitions since december   we completed the following acquisitions effective january   we acquired all of the assets of the behavioral health rehabilitation services business of raystown development services  inc  or raystown 
the business provides in home counseling and school based services in pennsylvania 
the purchase price consisted of cash totaling  the purchase price was primarily funded from our operating cash 
this acquisition further expanded our home and community based services in pennsylvania 
on august   psc of canada exchange corp  or psc  our subsidiary  acquired all of the equity interest in wcg international consultants ltd  or wcg  a victoria  british columbia based workforce initiative company with operations in communities across british columbia 
the purchase price included million in 
table of contents cash less certain adjustments contained in the purchase agreement and the sellers investment banking fees which were reimbursed by us and  exchangeable shares issued by psc valued at approximately million in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement million for accounting purposes  or exchangeable shares 
the exchangeable shares are exchangeable at each shareholder s option  for no additional consideration  into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded through our acquisition line of credit 
this acquisition expanded our workforce development services beyond the united states and provided a base of multi year contracts in canada 
on october   our wholly owned subsidiary  children s behavioral health  inc  or cbh  acquired substantially all of the assets of family children s services  inc  or fcs  located in sharon  pennsylvania 
fcs staff provides home and school based behavioral health rehabilitation services to adolescents under a commonwealth of pennsylvania department of public welfare program in several counties in northwestern pennsylvania 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash and the balance in a million subordinated promissory note that bears a fixed interest rate of per annum 
under the terms of the promissory note   is due six months and million is due months from the date of acquisition 
the cash portion of the purchase price was funded by cash from operations and borrowings under our acquisition line of credit 
this acquisition expanded our home and school based behavioral health rehabilitation services into northwestern pennsylvania 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding equity of charter lci corporation  or charter lci  the parent company of logisticare  inc  or logisticare 
logisticare  based in college park  georgia  is the nation s largest case management provider coordinating non emergency transportation services primarily to medicaid recipients 
the purchase price in the amount of million consisted primarily of cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement million for accounting purposes 
these shares were issued in exchange for the cancellation of logisticare employee stock options 
in addition  we may be obligated to pay additional amounts up to million under an earnout provision contained in the merger agreement 
the purchase price was paid with funds drawn down on a new credit facility and proceeds received from a private placement of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  or the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion rate of per share of common stock 
the initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain events 
the new credit agreement with cit provides us with a senior secured first lien credit facility in aggregate principal amount of million comprised of a million  six year term loan and a million  five year revolving credit facility 
we borrowed the entire amount available under the term loan facility and used the proceeds of the term loan to i fund a portion of the purchase price of this acquisition  ii refinance certain existing indebtedness  and iii pay fees and expenses related to this acquisition and the financing thereof 
by adding non emergency transportation services to our service offering  we are able to focus on better managing the front end of the medicaid service delivery system ultimately saving government payers money through combined transportation case management services and home based social services 
we continue to selectively identify and pursue attractive acquisition opportunities 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
how we earn our revenue effective december   as a result of our entering into the non emergency transportation services market through the acquisition of logisticare  we operate in two segments social services and non emergency transportation services  or net services 

table of contents social services our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide social services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of our managed entities 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
net services where we provide management services for non emergency transportation  we contract with either state government and regional medicaid agencies  local governments  or private managed care companies 
most of our contracts for non emergency transportation management services are capitated where we are paid on a per member per month basis for each eligible member 
we do not direct bill for services under our capitated contracts as our revenue is based on covered lives 
our special needs school transportation contracts are with local governments and are paid on a per trip basis per bus per day basis 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as non emergency transportation services revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  purchased transportation costs  accounting for management agreement relationships  loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs  stock based compensation  and foreign currency translation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time services are rendered at predetermined amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be reasonably assured 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 

table of contents as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
social services segment fee for service contracts 
revenues related to services provided under fee for service contracts are recognized as revenue at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and cost based service contracts 
revenues from our cost based service contracts in california are recorded at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after june  which is the contracting payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit the cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our cost reports are routinely audited on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and annual block purchase contract 
our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona  referred to as cpsa  requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
we are obliged to provide services only to those clients with a demonstrated medical necessity 
our annual funding allocation amount is subject to increase when our encounters exceed the contract amount  however  such increases in the annual funding allocation amount are subject to government appropriation and may not be approved 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries if the services are deemed to be medically necessary 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 

table of contents we are required to regularly submit service encounters to cpsa electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of cpsa s june fiscal year  cpsa is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  unless waived  cpsa has the right to prospectively reduce or suspend payments to us 
for revenue recognition purposes  our service encounter value which represents the value of actual services rendered must equal or exceed of the revenue recognized under our annual block purchase contract 
the remaining of revenue recognized each reporting period represents payment for network overhead administrative costs incurred in order to fulfill our obligations under the contract 
administrative costs include  but are not limited to  intake services  clinical liaison oversight for each behavioral health recipient  cultural liaisons  financial assessments and screening  data processing and information systems  staff training  quality and utilization management functions  coordination of care and subcontract administration 
we recognize revenue from our annual block purchase contract corresponding to the service encounter value 
if our service encounter value is less than of the amounts received from cpsa  unless waived  we recognize revenue equal to the service encounter value and defer revenue for any excess amounts received 
cpsa has not reduced  withheld  or suspended any payments and we believe our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts recorded as revenue under this contract 
if our service encounter value equals of the amounts received from cpsa  we recognize revenue at the contract amount  which is one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month 
if our service encounter value exceeds of the contract amount  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate factors regarding payment probability related to the determination of whether any such additional revenue over the contractual amount is considered to be reasonably assured 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract for the years ended december  and represented and of our social services operating segment revenues  respectively 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we recognize management fees revenue from our management agreements as such amounts are earned  as defined by the respective management agreements  and collection of such amount is considered reasonably assured 
we assess the likelihood of whether any of our management fees may need to be returned to help our managed entities fund their working capital needs 
if the likelihood is other than remote  we defer the recognition of all or a portion of the management fees received 
to the extent we defer management fees as a means of funding any of our managed entities losses from operations  such amounts are not recognized as management fees revenue until they are ultimately collected from the operating income of the managed entities 
in addition  as part of our reinsurance programs  we reinsure a substantial portion of the general and professional liability and workers compensation cost of certain designated entities we manage through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
further  we offered health insurance coverage to employees of certain entities we manage under our self funded health insurance program through june in exchange for this liability coverage we received a reimbursement equal to the pro rata share of the participating managed entities costs related to our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs 
we recorded amounts received from these managed entities as management fees revenue 
revenues related to these arrangements for the years ended december  and represented less than of our social services revenue 

table of contents consulting agreements 
historically  we entered into short term consulting agreements with several other social services providers  pursuant to which we were retained to  among other things  evaluate and make recommendations with respect to their management  administrative and operational services 
in exchange for these services  we received a fixed fee that was either payable upon completion of the services or on a monthly basis 
fees earned pursuant to our consulting agreements were accounted for as management fees revenue and represented less than of our social services revenue for the years ended december  and the costs associated with generating our management fee and consulting fee revenues are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income 
net services segment capitation contracts 
approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
revenues under capitation contracts with our payers result from per member monthly fees based on the number of participants in our payer s program 
aggregate revenue from our top five payers from december  to december  represented approximately of our net services operating segment revenue for such period 
fee for service contracts 
revenues earned under fee for service contracts are recognized when the service is provided 
revenue under these types of contracts is based upon contractually established billing rates less allowance for contractual adjustments 
estimates of contractual adjustments are based upon payment terms specified in the related agreements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts clients are referred to us through governmental social services programs and we only provide services at the direction of a payer under a contractual arrangement 
these circumstances have historically minimized any uncollectible amounts for services rendered 
however  we recognize that not all amounts recorded as accounts receivable will ultimately be collected 
we record all accounts receivable amounts at their contracted amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk that an account will not be collected 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
we pay particular attention to amounts outstanding for days and longer 
any account receivable older than days is deemed uncollectible and written off or fully allowed for unless we have specific information from the payer that payment for those amounts is forthcoming 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
under certain of our contracts  billings do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract due to payer administrative issues 
these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded for which no amount has been invoiced and for which we expect an invoice will not be provided to the payer within the next reporting period 
all unbilled amounts are expected to be billed within one year 
our write off experience for the years ended december  and was less than of revenue  and for the year ended december  was approximately of revenue 
our write off experience increased from to due to the write off in of approximately million of revenue recognized in the amount of approximately million in each of and under our annual block purchase contract with cpsa in excess of the annual funding allocation amount 

table of contents accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year and between annual valuations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when determining whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss is measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed as of december  resulted in no impairment losses 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocated a portion of the purchase consideration to management contracts  customer relationships  restrictive covenants  software licenses and developed technology based on the expected direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on a discounted cash flow basis over the useful life of the assets  and we consider allocating goodwill to existing reporting units which benefit from synergies after the acquisition 
we accrue contingent amounts in an acquisition up to the amount of identifiable net assets 
we assess whether any relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes 
we determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
if applicable  we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
accrued transportation costs transportation costs are estimated and accrued in the month the services are rendered by outsourced providers utilizing gross reservations for transportation services less cancellations  and average costs per transportation service by customer contract 
average costs per contract are derived by utilizing historical cost trends 
actual costs relating to a specific accounting period are monitored and compared to estimated accruals 
adjustments to those accruals are made based on reconciliations with actual costs incurred 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with business development  administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly with state and local agencies to supply a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and organized with its own independent board of directors 

table of contents our management agreements with these not for profit organizations typically require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
the accounting for our relationships with these organizations is based on a number of judgments regarding certain facts related to the control of these organizations and the terms of our management agreements 
any significant changes in the facts upon which these judgments are based could have a significant impact on our accounting for these relationships 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of emerging issues task force  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with consolidated management agreements  or the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised  or interpretation no 
r  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of interpretation no 
r  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities we manage under reinsurance programs though our wholly owned subsidiary spcic 
spcic maintains reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage 
in addition  effective december   and in connection with the acquisition of logisticare  we acquired provado insurance services  inc  or provado 
provado  a wholly owned subsidiary of logisticare  is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
provado provides reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties within our net services operating segment 
we also maintain a self funded health insurance program provided to our employees 
as of december  and  we had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs  and approximately  and million  respectively  in reserve for our self funded health insurance programs 
provado maintains reserves for obligations related to the reinsurance programs for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage 
as of december   provado had reserves of approximately million 
these reserves are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as reinsurance liability reserves 
we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to the general and professional liability coverage  workers compensation coverage  automobile liability  automobile physical damage  and health insurance coverage 

table of contents with respect to our self funded health insurance program  we also consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance program liability and related expense 
we record claims expense by plan year based on the lesser of the aggregate stop loss if applicable or the developed losses as calculated by independent actuaries with respect to our general and professional liability coverage  and our past experience and industry experience with respect to our workers compensation coverage and health insurance coverage 
we continually analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs 
we believe our reserves are adequate 
however  significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
we are at risk for differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
there were no significant adjustments recorded in the periods covered by this report 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
with respect to stock option awards  the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and amortized over the option s vesting periods 
the black scholes merton option pricing formula requires us to make assumptions for the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  life of options and risk free interest rate 
we adopted the requirements of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
other than certain options previously issued at amounts below fair market value for accounting and reporting purposes in and the expense associated with the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding stock options in  no other stock based compensation cost has been reflected in our net income prior to the adoption of sfas r 
financial results for prior periods have not been restated 
we use the short cut method described in fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards in accordance with the effective date and transition provisions thereof related to our calculation of the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of statement r  or apic pool 
sfas r requires an entity to include the net excess tax benefits that would have qualified as such had the entity adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for recognition purposes 
there was no effect on our financial results for or related to the application of the short cut method to determine our apic pool balance 
prior to january   we followed the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation plans and presented all benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock based awards as operating cash flows in our statements of cash flows 
under sfas r  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the estimated tax benefit of compensation costs recognized in the income statement for those options are classified as financing cash flows 
for the years ended december   and  the amount of excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options was approximately million  million and  respectively 
these amounts are reflected as cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  and financing activities for the years ended december  and in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our long term incentive plan  or plan allows us the flexibility to issue up to  shares of our common stock pursuant to awards of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  unrestricted 
table of contents stock  stock units including restricted stock units and performance awards to employees  directors  consultants  advisors and others who are in a position to make contributions to our success and to encourage such persons to take into account our long term interests and the interests of our stockholders through ownership of our common stock or securities with value tied to our common stock 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total fair value of shares vested during and was and million  respectively 
foreign currency translation the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiary are measured using the foreign subsidiary s local currency as the functional currency 
revenues and expenses of this subsidiary are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange on the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gain and loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of stockholders equity  unless there is a sale or complete liquidation of the underlying foreign investment 
presently  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in foreign operations 
therefore  we are not providing for us or additional foreign withholding taxes on our foreign subsidiary s undistributed earnings 
generally  such earnings become subject to us tax upon the remittance of dividends and under other circumstances 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability on such undistributed earnings due to the complexities of internal revenue code of  as amended  rules and regulations and the hypothetical nature of the calculations 
results of operations segment reporting 
our operations are organized and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker along our service lines in two reportable segments ie social services and net services 
we operate these reportable segments as separate divisions and differentiate the segments based on the nature of the services they offer

management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
the not for profit social services organizations managed by us that qualify under section c of the internal revenue code  referred to as a c entity  each maintain a board of directors  a majority of which are independent 
all economic decisions by the board of any c entity that affect us are made solely by the independent board members 
our management agreements with each c entity are typically subject to third party fairness opinions from an independent appraiser retained by the independent board members of the tax exempt organizations

in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services which generally includes selecting and employing the senior operations management personnel 
management fee receivable at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and management fee revenue was recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a management fee receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 
the following is a summary of the aging of our management fee receivable balances as of december   march  june  september  and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  each month we examine each of our managed entities with regard to its solvency  outlook and ability to pay us any outstanding management fees 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable 
our days sales outstanding for our managed entities increased from days at december  to days at december  camelot community care  inc which represented approximately million  or approximately  of our total management fee receivable at december  has its own stand alone line of credit with cit healthcare llc 
the loan agreement between cit healthcare llc and this not for profit organization permits them to use their credit facility to pay our management fees  provided they are not in default under the facility at the time of the payment 
as of december   camelot community care  inc had availability of approximately million under its line of credit as well as million in cash and cash equivalents 
the remaining million balance of our total management fee receivable at december  was due from intervention services  inc  rio grande including certain members of the rio grande behavioral health network  the redco group  care development of maine  fcp  inc  family preservation community services  inc  the not for profit foster care provider formerly managed by maple services  llc  and alternative opportunities managed by wd management 
we have deemed payment of all of the foregoing receivables to be probable based on our collection history with these entities as the long term manager of their operations 
reinsurance and self funded insurance programs reinsurance we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities we 
table of contents manage under reinsurance programs though spcic 
we also provide reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to certain members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties under our net services segment through provado 
these decisions were made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations  and fluctuating insurance premium rates 
spcic spcic reinsures the third party insurer for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to million per loss and million in the aggregate 
the gross written premiums for this policy at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately  the excess premium over our expected losses may be used to fund spcic s operating expenses  any deficit arising in the workers compensation liability coverage  to provide for surplus reserves and to fund other risk management activities 
spcic reinsures a third party insurer for worker s compensation insurance for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence with no annual aggregate limit 
the third party insurer provides a deductible buy back policy with a limit of  per occurrence that provides coverage for all states where coverage is required 
the gross written premium for this policy at december  and was million and million  respectively  which was ceded to spcic

spcic had restricted cash of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which was restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary using historical data  industry data  and our experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
provado under a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurer  provado retains the first  of each loss for each line of coverage 
provado also retains a finite corridor in the  excess of the  layer of coverage 
this corridor is subject to an annual aggregate based on an annually determined composite rate per vehicle covered

the liabilities for expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are based primarily on individual case estimates for losses reported by claimants 
an estimate is provided for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported on the basis of claim experience and claim experience of the industry

health insurance we offer our employees an option to participate in a self funded health insurance program 
with respect to our social services operating segment and for the program year ended june   health claims were self 
table of contents funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for total annual claims up to million 
effective july   we renewed our stop loss umbrella policy under substantially the same terms as the prior year policy except for the maximum potential liability for total claims which may change substantially depending on member enrollment 
with respect to our net services operating segment  we offer self funded health insurance and dental plans to our employees 
health claims under this program are self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability to  per incident and a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on an established cap and current payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately  and million as of december  and  respectively  was recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
we charge our employees a portion of the costs of our self funded group health insurance programs 
we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
we estimate potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
contractual cash obligations

as of december   we spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock on the open market 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and working capital credit facility provide sufficient funds to meet our operating plan for the next twelve months 
the operating plan for this period provides for full operation of our businesses  and interest and projected principal payments on our debt 
we may also access capital markets to raise debt or equity financing for various business reasons  including required debt payments  potential earn out payments and acquisitions that make both strategic and economic 
table of contents sense 
the timing  term  size  and pricing of any such financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  with respect to required debt payments  our credit agreement with cit requires that upon receipt of any proceeds from a disposition  involuntary disposition  equity issuance  or debt issuance as defined in the credit agreement we must prepay principal then outstanding in an aggregate amount equal to of such proceeds 
our liquidity and financial position will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates on the portion of debt that bears interest at variable interest rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency translation effective august   we began conducting business in canada through our wholly owned subsidiary wcg  and as such  our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency 
table of contents exchange rates 
we believe that the impact of currency fluctuations does not represent a significant risk to us given the size and scope of our current international operations
