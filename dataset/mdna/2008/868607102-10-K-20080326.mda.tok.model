results of operations comparison of with net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to our core dry freight sales  our largest product group  which declined by million  or 
we attribute the decrease in our core dry freight products to continued industry wide softness in the retail truck market 
partially offsetting this decrease were favorable sales contributions from our startrans bus division which experienced a increase to million  and our armored division  which increased over the prior year  to million in additionally  silver crown  one of our specialty product divisions  increased sales to million  a increase  resulting from the increased market penetration of this acquisition 
our total sales backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  cost of sales and gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million of net sales for the year ended december  compared to million of net sales for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for and and the changes from percent change material direct labor overhead delivery cost of sales gross profit material material cost as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase of was attributable to our growing startrans bus division and our silver crown division which have a higher material content and accounted for a larger portion of our total sales volume in partially offsetting the increase in the material percentage was an improvement of in our core truck divisions which resulted from working with our material suppliers to strengthen our supply chain logistics while controlling material costs 
however  raw material costs continue to remain a concern as costs are increasing for aluminum  steel  and petroleum based raw materials 
we are closely monitoring and managing all material costs through timely communication and negotiation with key suppliers  and will continue to make efforts to recover raw material cost increases through the pricing of our products 
the company also continues to strive to reduce the costs of its products through research into innovative materials and the use of robotics 
historically  the company has experienced and recorded both favorable and unfavorable physical inventory adjustments 
due to our product diversity  complexity  customization  and on line engineering  inventory relief using standard bills of material does not provide full relief of our inventory 
therefore  the company records an additional cost relief adjustment based on various factors 
in addition  the company intensified its bills of material accuracy initiatives and cost relief systems and methods in conjunction with performing additional interim physical inventories and recording any adjustments relating thereto 
in  the company recorded favorable inventory adjustments of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a million favorable inventory adjustment 
in  the company improved its bills of materials accuracy without changing its cost relief adjustment to account for these improvements resulting in a favorable inventory adjustment for the year 
the more frequent physical inventories and the continued improvements from the process improvement initiatives should enable the company to continue to minimize the physical inventory adjustments see inventory relief below in our discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the direct labor improvement was the result of the efficiencies realized from contracting fewer  more costly temporary workers at our core truck divisions due to reduced sales volume 
additionally  in the first half of we experienced a delay in oem supplied chassis which caused the company to temporarily suspend production  thereby negatively affecting labor and overhead absorption 
as noted earlier  while our startrans bus division and silver crown division material content is higher than our core truck products  the labor percentage is lower in these divisions further reducing the overall company labor percentage as a result of the our change in product mix for overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in overall  the company was able to effectively manage its cost structure to the lower sales volume experienced in however  our group health insurance expense increased when compared to to combat the increase in group health insurance  the company continues to implement changes to its group health insurance plan design in an effort to control future claim costs

additionally  sales commission expense decreased due to the lower sales volume experienced during compared to g a expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to non recurring fees associated with complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of other income other income remained relatively constant at million for the year ended december  and december  other income consisted of rental income  gain on sale of assets  and other miscellaneous income received by the company through its various business activities 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million of net sales for the year ended december  compared to million of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was due to less borrowing under the company s working capital line of credit and a decrease in chassis interest expense 
the decrease in bank interest expense also reflects lower prevailing interest rates  coupled with an increased focus on working capital management and managing our working capital levels in accordance with the lower sales volume experienced in additionally  the decrease in chassis interest expense was due to reduced consigned chassis inventory levels relating to light duty chassis 
in  we experienced an unanticipated slowdown in the light duty truck market causing a build up of consigned chassis inventory which resulted in increased chassis interest expense 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the effective income tax rates for both years were favorably impacted by tax exempt underwriting income of a wholly owned small captive insurance subsidiary  by the additional tax deduction allowed manufacturers under the american jobs creation act  federal alternative fuel tax credits  and federal and state research and development tax credits

an industry wide reduction in truck purchases contributed to lower fleet sales but this was offset by increases in our core dry freight product line and our startrans bus division which increased and  respectively 
we partially attribute the increased retail demand of our dry freight product line to customers buying chassis to avoid the higher cost of chassis 
new  more stringent diesel engine emission standards became effective for engines produced beginning january  the increased startrans bus division revenues were the result of a strong demand for mid size buses and a new cycle of transit authority purchasing

direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the direct labor percentage increase was the result of a delay in oem supplied chassis in the first quarter that caused the company to temporarily shut down production lines  thereby negatively affecting labor and overhead absorption 
despite these challenges  direct labor as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant for both years 
overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase was primarily due to higher workers compensation costs

to promote the company s expanding and extensive product lines  the company also experienced higher trade show and related expenses in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the decrease in incentive compensation tied directly to the decrease in pretax income

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance  and accrued warranty 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue when the unit is shipped to the customer 
revenue on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions is recognized after the customer is notified that the products have been completed according to customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery based on established delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would adversely affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of raw materials and finished products and provide for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand  and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would adversely affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material adjusted for scrap and other estimated factors affecting inventory relief 
because of our large and diverse product line and the customized nature of each order  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments which are based on estimates are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the calculations to estimate costs not captured in the bill of materials take into account the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances  and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not fully known until physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s plant locations 
we conduct semi annual physical inventories at all locations and schedule them in a manner that provides coverage in each of our calendar quarters 
we have invested significant resources in our continuing effort to improve the physical inventory process and accuracy of our inventory accounting system 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier  and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates  and any subsequent changes in estimates  may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
the company utilizes a wholly owned small captive insurance company to insure certain of its business risks 
certain risks  traditionally self insured by the company and its subsidiaries  are insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
in addition  certain business risks not traditionally insured are insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
since the captive insurance company has not reinsured any of its coverages  the company s overall self insurance risk has not changed 
the captive insurance subsidiary helps the company manage its risk exposures and  under the internal revenue code  the net underwriting income of such a small captive is not taxable 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience 
pending accounting pronouncements see recent accounting pronouncements in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  other than historical facts  which reflect the view of management with respect to future events

although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  and it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such expectations include  without limitation  limitations on the availability of chassis on which the company s product is dependent  availability of raw materials  raw material cost increases and severe interest rate increases 
furthermore  the company can provide no assurance that such raw material cost increases can be passed on to its customers through implementation of price increases for the company s products 
the forward looking statements contained herein reflect the current view of management with respect to future events and are subject to those factors and other risks  uncertainties  and assumptions relating to the operations  results of operations  cash flows and financial position of the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of investing  financing  and operating 
the company s primary risk exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
in an effort to manage risk exposures  the company strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions 
the company s revolving line of credit is floating rate debt and bears interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus certain basis points depending on the pricing option selected and the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the company had in effect an interest rate swap agreement dated july  the interest rate swap agreement is a contract to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreement and is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure of credit loss 
the differential paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the following is a summary of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  notional amount fixed rate maturity july  based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
