this consolidation occurred during the fourth quarter 
the closure of the ohio facility had minimal impact on revenues  as all existing builders in that region have continued to be served by the company s housing operations in indiana and north carolina 
housing segment the housing group faced a challenging housing market in the december full year figures on housing starts from the us census bureau show a year to year decline in new single family homes nationwide  and a decline in the midwest region served by the group s plants in indiana and iowa 
the decline includes the southeastern and middle atlantic markets  which are served by the group s plants in virginia and north carolina 
single family housing starts in the south region showed a year to year decline of in december 
in the backdrop of such a difficult market  the housing group has seen weakness in its core midwestern markets as well as in the southeast and middle atlantic regions  negatively impacting the group s operations in indiana  iowa  north carolina and virginia 
all of the group s markets have experienced sharp discounts  larger incentives  and increased levels of new home inventories 
as the downward pressure on new home sales persists  the group will likely see the more aggressive discounts and incentives by home builders continue 
to mitigate these conditions  management is placing more emphasis on providing value to builders and consumers through the group s products  including the launch of the green catalog in the first quarter of driven by consumer interest and high energy costs  the housing industry is beginning to recognize the increasing need for energy efficiency and the use of sustainable materials in the construction of new homes 
the company has taken a leadership position in this market transformation with this initiative 
the green catalog will allow consumers to choose what technologies and earth friendly materials they want included in their new homes 
the group is working with design build architectural firms that specialize in sustainable  innovative  high quality modular architecture 
sustainable  well designed buildings should be accessible to more people 
off site modular technology is a means to create beautiful  eco friendly homes and buildings 
this project resulted in the mksolaire home which will be prominently displayed in the smart home green wired exhibit at the museum of science and industry in chicago from may through january this endeavor should put modular construction in a new light for the general public and fits well with our commitment to sustainable construction 
management s overriding goal with these actions is to provide the group s builders with the products and tools they need to best meet the challenges of their markets 
management continued to work to mitigate the group s dependence on traditional scattered lot single family housing markets by increasing the expansion into multi family residential structures through all american building systems  or aabs 
many of these multi family structures markets are large project markets such as dormitories  military barracks and apartments that typically have a long incubation period  but generally result in a significant contract 
in  aabs was a leading member of a consortium that completed the second phase of barracks construction at fort bliss in texas 
on january   the company announced that aabs had signed a final agreement to provide modules for barracks construction at fort carson in colorado 
aabs continues to pursue military opportunities with our partners  and aabs expects to make proposals in for additional military housing contracts 
the company is delivering homes to the gulf coast region and our major projects sales group is pursuing additional opportunities now that the rebuilding effort is finally gaining momentum 
the group has also targeted other large projects such as dormitories  condominiums and apartment complexes 
overall  was a difficult year for the housing group  but management took aggressive steps to reduce operating costs and maintain profitability despite lower revenues 
early in  the group installed a new senior management team with the talent  experience and drive to lead it forward 
management is aggressively seeking new ways to strengthen the group s traditional markets while pursuing growth in new areas 
recreational vehicle segment despite the improvements recognized in the rv group s operations throughout  low sales volumes and production levels resulted in unacceptable bottom line results for the year 
to address the unacceptable level of revenues  the rv group has embarked on a number of actions to drive revenue growth and enhance profitability 
management believes that customers of the rv industry are demanding improved quality 
accordingly  management believes it can differentiate coachmen s products from those of its competitors  and gain a marketing advantage  by improving product quality 
the rv group has launched a number of initiatives to this end 
the most important new program rewards meaningful  continuous improvement in the quality of products at every production facility 
the program provides our team members with incentive to meet and exceed concrete  quantifiable measures of quality applicable to each facility 
the incentive program was launched as a pilot program in  and expanded into a company wide program in the incentive program has been very successful in reducing the average number of defects per unit  and has resulted in greater satisfaction among dealers 
with regard to efforts to build upon product line strengths that began in late  the rv group continued to make significant strides in improving its product offerings and reducing product complexity 
the group has achieved a significant transformation of product with its new product development process utilizing its advanced design team 
at the national rv trade show held annually in louisville  the company s products displayed showed continued improvement in innovation resulting from the group s more robust product development process 
over of the products on display at louisville were new or redesigned innovative products including the new touring prism class c motorhome featuring yacht inspired interiors and estimated gas mileage of miles per gallon  a freelander class c motorhome with an innovative rear wall slide out  a re engineered spirit of america travel trailer line that is fully laminated with aluminum cage construction providing high line features at a reduced weight at an entry level price point  total redesign and step out of the leprechaun class c  and a very creative new floorplan offered in both the pursuit and mirada class a product lines featuring dual living areas with a unique murphy bed 
during july  the company announced plans to reduce overhead costs by consolidating class a production into a single facility  relocating the paint facility located in elkhart  indiana to the main complex in middlebury  indiana  and consolidating two towable assembly plants into a single facility in order to reduce expenses and improve profitability through improved capacity utilization of fewer facilities 
the consolidation of the class a assembly plants was substantially completed in the third quarter of the consolidation and subsequent mothballing of a towable plant was completed in the fourth quarter of the paint facility was relocated to the main complex in the fourth quarter of management believes there are still opportunities to reduce material costs  which make up the majority of the group s cost of sales 
in order to quickly achieve significant results  in early  consultants were engaged to assist with identifying and executing strategic sourcing action plans  resulting in significant savings 
management has reorganized its strategic sourcing team into a cohesive unit that continues to apply the processes and practices developed with the consultants guidance 
the ultimate goal of these actions is to continue to improve quality and reduce cost in order to improve margins 
management is also applying best practices from this effort to purchasing and material sourcing in the housing group 
despite the difficult year  management is optimistic that the hard work of its entire team will pay substantial future dividends 
management will strive to leverage the many changes and improvements that have been made throughout the rv group to generate improved results and market share gains in and the years ahead

note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related income statement  asset and or liability amounts 
long lived assets long lived assets held and used by the company  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements for asset impairments recorded in and  including impairments of intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to impairment tests at least annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill assets annually by segment to determine if such assets may be impaired 
if the carrying amounts of these assets are not recoverable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  such assets are reduced by the estimated shortfall of fair value to recorded value 
sfas no 
required the company to perform an interim goodwill impairment evaluation during the quarter ended june  because the carrying value of the rv reporting unit exceeded its fair value as calculated using the expected present value of future cash flows  the company concluded that the goodwill was impaired as of june  accordingly  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the quarter ended june  the company has performed the required annual impairment tests and has determined that there was no impairment indicated for the remaining housing reporting unit goodwill at december  our estimates of fair value of the housing reporting unit could change as a result of our actual cash flows differing from our forecasted cash flows  which were used in our estimate of fair value 
further  a variance in the discount rate used could have an impact on the amount of goodwill impairment recorded 
revenue recognition for the rv segment  the shipping terms are free on board fob shipping point and title and risk of ownership are transferred to the independent dealers at that time 
accordingly  sales are recognized as revenue at the time the products are shipped 
for the housing segment  the shipping terms are either fob shipping point or fob destination 
for traditional home sales  shipping terms are generally fob destination and title and risk of ownership are generally transferred when the company completes installation of the product 
for traditional homes fob destination shipping terms  the company generally recognizes the revenue at the time delivery and installation are completed 
revenue from final set up procedures  which are perfunctory  is deferred and recognized when such set up procedures are completed 
major projects shipping terms are usually detailed in the contract  and title and risk of ownership are transferred per the contract 
in the case of these major projects  the company recognizes the revenue when title and risk of ownership are transferred according to the terms of the contract 
warranty reserves the company provides customers of its products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to two years in length and up to ten years on certain structural components 
the company records a liability based on its estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale and included in cost of sales 
general warranty reserves are estimated based upon past warranty claims and unit sales history and adjusted as required to reflect actual costs incurred  as information becomes available 
specific warranty reserves are based on specific identified issues with the amounts accrued based on the estimated cost to correct the problem 
while the company believes this method to be consistent and appropriate  changes in estimates could materially affect the company s recorded liability for loss 
warranty expense from continuing operations totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
accrued liabilities for warranty expense at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in warranty accrual for of million to million is the result of specific reserves established in related to the recall of defective camping trailer lift systems and the repair of defective material used in laminated sidewalls of certain of the company s recreational vehicles  lower sales levels and improvements in quality 
most of the claims against these specific reserves were paid by the company in and in the first quarter of litigation and insurance reserves at december  the company had reserves for certain other loss exposures  such as product liability  workers compensation and group health insurance million and litigation million see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s litigation reserve is determined based on an individual case evaluation process 
the company is self insured for a portion of its product liability  workers compensation and group health insurance and certain other liability exposures 
depending on the nature of the claim and the date of occurrence  the company s maximum exposure ranges from  to  per claim 
the company accrues an estimated liability based on historical losses  insurance coverage and the amount of outstanding claims 
management believes the liability recorded see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements is adequate to cover the company s self insured risk 
the company s estimated loss reserves for product liability  workers compensation and group health insurance are determined using loss triangles established by the company s management reflecting historical claims incurred by the company 
while the company believes this method to be consistent and appropriate  changes in estimates based on historical trends could materially affect the company s recorded liabilities for loss 
income taxes the company recognizes income tax expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse and are subject to ongoing assessment of realizability 
deferred income tax expense benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets may be recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future periods and for loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
primarily due to the company s losses from continuing operations over the last three years  noncash charges from continuing operations of million and million were recorded as a valuation allowance for the full value of its deferred tax assets as of december  and  respectively 
depending on future operating results it is possible the valuation allowance could be reversed which would increase deferred tax assets and the company s income tax benefit

these forward looking statements are based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are dependent on various factors  many of which are outside the control of the company

in addition  investors should be aware that generally accepted accounting principles prescribe when a company must disclose or reserve for particular risks  including litigation exposures 
accordingly  results for a given reporting period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for a major contingency 
reported results may therefore appear to be volatile in certain accounting periods 
the foregoing lists are not exhaustive  and the company disclaims any obligation to subsequently revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
at times  the company s actual performance differs materially from its projections and estimates regarding the economy  the recreational vehicle and building industries and other key performance indicators 
readers of this report are cautioned that reliance on any forward looking statements involves risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the assumptions on which the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate given the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing and investing yields 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact both the company s short and long term debt 
during  and  the company has utilized its revolving credit facility to meet short term working capital needs 
the company had million outstanding against the revolving credit facility on december  the company had million outstanding against the revolving credit facility on december  and million outstanding against the revolving credit facility on december  at december   the company had million of long term debt  including current maturities 
long term debt consists mainly of industrial development revenue bonds of approximately million 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at the end of the year  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of an annual period would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately million 
at december   the company had one interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that was used to convert the variable interest rates on an industrial development revenue bond to a fixed rate 
in accordance with the terms of the swap agreement  the company pays a interest rate  and receives the bond market association index bma  calculated on the notional amount  with net receipts or payments being recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
this swap agreement  along with those terminated in and  is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and effectively converts a portion of the company s variable rate borrowing to a fixed rate basis through november of  thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreement represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
a cumulative loss of  net of taxes  attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  if in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  the company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
