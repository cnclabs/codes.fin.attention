item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review the principal objective of this financial review is to provide an overview of the financial condition and results of operations of provident bankshares corporation and its subsidiaries for the three years ended december  this discussion and tabular presentations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes as well as the other information herein  particularly the information regarding the corporation s business operations as described in item overview of income and expenses income the corporation has two primary sources of pre tax income 
the first is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income which is the income that the corporation earns on its loans and investments and interest expense which is the interest that is paid on its deposits and borrowings 
the second principal source of pre tax income is non interest income the compensation received from providing products and services 
the majority of the non interest income comes from service charges on deposit accounts 
the corporation also earns income from insurance commissions  mortgage banking fees and other fees and charges 
the corporation recognizes gains or losses as a result of sales of investment securities or the disposition of loans  foreclosed property or fixed assets 
in addition  the corporation also recognizes gains or losses on its outstanding derivative financial instruments or impairment on investment securities that are considered other than temporarily impaired 
gains and losses are not a regular part of the corporation s primary source of income 
expenses the expenses the corporation incurs in operating its business consist of salaries and employee benefits expense  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  external processing fees  deposit insurance premiums  advertising expenses  and other miscellaneous expenses 
salaries and benefits expense consists primarily of the salaries and wages paid to employees  payroll taxes and expenses for health care  retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy expense  which are fixed or variable costs associated with building and equipment  consist primarily of lease payments  real estate taxes  depreciation charges  maintenance and cost of utilities 
furniture and equipment expenses and depreciation charges related to office and banking equipment 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line and accelerated methods based on the useful lives of related assets 
estimated lives range from to years for building and improvements  and to years for furniture and equipment 
external processing fees are fees paid to third parties for data processing services 
restructuring activities are incremental expenses associated with corporate efficiency and infrastructure initiatives implemented to simplify the corporation s business model as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other expenses include expenses for attorneys  accountants and consultants  fees paid to directors  franchise taxes  charitable contributions  insurance  office supplies  postage  telephone and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  management initiated a corporate wide efficiency and infrastructure initiative program to increase productivity  streamline processes and improve customer service 
the program focused on three major areas the rationalization of the branch network  the composition and execution of fee generation activities  and the third and largest focus  the fundamental efficiency of loan and deposit operational support activities 
as part of the efficiency initiative program  management established four action teams to identify revenue and efficiency opportunities 
these cross functional teams worked with outside consultants to analyze expense and revenue opportunities based on industry best practices 
the identified financial objective was to reduce operating expenses and increase fee income for a total pre tax impact of million in and million in in  the internal action teams completed their work around reviewing processes and redesigning the corporation s structure to make better use of its resources 
the bulk of the teams recommendations centered on organizational design changes in the branches  branch operations and customer support  and in the loan administration functions 
in addition  the corporation modified pricing and fees on selected deposit products and loan services along with introducing new products 
operational changes were also made to improve the collection of fees that are currently generated but waived or not collected 
the initial phase of this program was an extensive internal review of the branch network locations to consider each location s profitability  opportunity for growth and proximity to other branches 
the review work was completed in the first quarter of and implementation of the efficiency initiatives were put in place 
in the first quarter of  the corporation closed one branch in maryland and six branches in virginia  transferring million in deposits to other nearby provident branches 
in addition  the branch closure initiative resulted in a thousand gain associated with the sale of a branch facility 
on september   the corporation completed a sale of the million in deposits and facilities of six branches in western and central virginia to union bankshares of bowling green  virginia with an associated gain of million 
the sale of the six branches was consistent with the corporation s strategy to rationalize the branch network and to focus on the corporation s core markets the high growth  metropolitan areas of baltimore  washington and richmond 
the actions taken by the program contributed approximately million in expense savings and revenue enhancements in the financial benefits received in from these efforts were partially offset by million in professional fees paid to the corporation s third party consulting partner in the program 
restructuring costs  which are expenses directly associated with the actions taken from the program  were million and are being reported separately in the consolidated statements of income 
the corporation s restructuring activities eliminated approximately million annualized compensation and benefits costs relating to positions that were removed from the corporation s base cost structure 
the corporation estimates that the program will generate over million in cost savings and revenue enhancements in in addition  management has instituted a compensation control program that provides accountability at the position level 
management is confident that the results of the program will enable the corporation to keep pace with market compensation rates and to add personnel costs relating to new business initiatives without having an adverse effect on the corporation s operating expense growth rate 
management will continue to review its staffing levels as changes in technology become available and are implemented 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods 
management evaluates estimates on an on going basis  and believes the following values represent its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  non accrual loans  other real estate owned  estimates of fair value and intangible assets associated with mergers  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  pension and post retirement benefits  asset prepayment rates  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based payment  derivative financial instruments  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
it is at least reasonably possible that each of the corporation s estimates could change in the near term and the effect of the change could be material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  derivative financial instruments  goodwill and intangible assets  asset prepayment rates  and income taxes 
each estimate is discussed on pages the financial impact of each estimate  to the extent significant to financial results  is discussed in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis 
allowance for loan losses the corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses the allowance  which is intended to be management s best estimate of probable inherent losses in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
the provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance to a level considered necessary by management 
the allowance is based on management s continuing review and credit risk evaluation of the loan portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
to arrive at the allocated component of the allowance  the corporation combines estimates of the allowances needed for loans analyzed individually and on a pooled basis 
the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the portion of the allowance that is allocated to individual internally criticized and non accrual loans is determined by estimating the inherent loss on each problem credit after giving consideration to the value of underlying collateral 
management emphasizes loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits 
credit risk identification and review processes are utilized in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s lending and credit administration staff are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio and identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
a loan classification and review system exists that identifies those loans with a higher than normal risk of uncollectibility 
each commercial loan is assigned a grade based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
in addition to being used to categorize risk  the bank s internal ten point risk rating system is used to determine the allocated allowance for the commercial portfolio 
reserve factors  based on the actual loss history for a year period for criticized loans  are assigned 
if the factor  based on loss history for classified credits is lower than the minimum established factor  the higher factor is applied 
for loans with satisfactory risk profiles  the factors are based on the rating profile of the portfolio and the consequent historic losses of bonds with equivalent ratings 
for the consumer portfolios  the determination of the allocated allowance is conducted at an aggregate  or pooled  level 
each quarter  historical rolling loss rates for homogenous pools of loans in these portfolios provide the basis for the allocated reserve 
for any portfolio where the bank lacks sufficient historic experience  industry loss rates are used 
if recent history is not deemed to reflect the inherent losses existing within a portfolio  older historic loss rates during a period of similar economic or market conditions are used 
the bank s credit administration group adjusts the indicated loss rates based on qualitative factors 
factors that are considered in adjusting loss rates include risk characteristics  credit concentration trends and general economic conditions  including job growth and unemployment rates 
for commercial and real estate portfolios  additional factors include the level and trend of watched and criticized credits within those portfolios  commercial real estate vacancy  absorption and rental rates  and the number and volume of syndicated credits  construction loans  or other portfolio segments deemed to carry higher levels of risk 
upon completion of the qualitative adjustments  the overall allowance is allocated to the components of the portfolio based on the adjusted loss factors 
the unallocated component of the allowance exists to mitigate the imprecision inherent in management s estimates of expected credit losses and includes its judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for concentrations  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors that may not have been fully considered in the allocated allowance 
the relationship of the unallocated component to the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
although management has allocated the majority of the allowance to specific loan categories  the evaluation of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
lending management meets at least quarterly with executive management to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and to evaluate the allowance 
the corporation has an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality and reports the results of its reviews to executive management and the board of directors 
such reviews also assist management in establishing the level of the allowance 
management believes that it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate 
the fdic examines the bank periodically and  accordingly  as part of this examination  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy utilizing specific guidelines 
based upon their review  the regulators may from time to time require reserves in addition to those previously provided 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  in addition to the reasons underlying the decline  to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary  such as the ability to collect amounts due per the contractual terms of the investment security agreement 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline in value is permanent 
it indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value are not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to  or greater than  the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
derivative financial instruments the corporation uses various derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate risk management strategy to mitigate the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the derivative financial instruments used separately or in combination are interest rate swaps and caps 
derivative financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements 
fair value represents the payment the corporation would receive or pay if the item were sold or bought in a current transaction 
fair values are generally based on market quotes 
the accounting for changes in fair value gains or losses of a derivative is dependent on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 the corporation assigns derivatives to one of these categories at the purchase date fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or non designated derivatives 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of the expected and ongoing hedge effectiveness of any derivative designated a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
derivatives are included in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of condition 
fair value hedges for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the derivative instrument and related hedged item are marked to market through the related interest income or expense  as applicable  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in non interest income 
cash flow hedges for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  mark to market adjustments are recorded net of income taxes as a component of other comprehensive income oci in stockholders equity  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in non interest income 
amounts recorded in oci are recognized into earnings concurrent with the hedged items impact on earnings 
non designated derivatives certain economic hedges are not designated as cash flow or as fair value hedges for accounting purposes 
as a result  changes in the fair value are recorded in non interest income in the consolidated statements of income 
interest income or expense related to non designated derivatives is also recorded in non interest income 
all qualifying relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items are fully documented by the corporation 
risk management objectives  strategies and the projected effectiveness of the chosen derivatives to hedge specific risks are also documented 
at inception of the hedging relationship and periodically as required under sfas no 
 the corporation evaluates the effectiveness of its hedging instruments 
for hedges qualifying for short cut treatment at inception  the ongoing effectiveness testing includes a review of the hedge and the hedged item to determine if the hedge continues to qualify for short cut treatment 
an assumption of no hedge ineffectiveness is allowed for derivatives qualifying for short cut treatment 
for all other derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting  a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the hedge is required at each reporting date 
the corporation performs effectiveness testing quarterly for all of its hedges 
the corporation uses benchmark interest rates such as libor to hedge the interest rate risk associated with interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
using benchmark rates and complying with specific criteria set forth in sfas no  the corporation has concluded that for qualifying hedges  changes in fair value or cash flows that are attributable to risks being hedged will be highly effective at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis 
when it is determined that a derivative is not  or ceases to be effective as a hedge  the corporation discontinues hedge accounting prospectively 
when a fair value hedge is discontinued due to ineffectiveness  the corporation continues to carry the derivative on the consolidated statements of condition at its fair value as a non designated derivative  but discontinues marking to market the hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value 
any previous mark to market adjustments recorded to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the asset or liability 
all ineffective portions of fair value hedges are reported in and affect net income immediately 
when a cash flow hedge is discontinued due to termination of the derivative  the corporation continues to carry the previous mark to market adjustments in accumulated oci and recognizes the amount into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings 
if the cash flow hedge is discontinued due to ineffectiveness  the derivative would be considered a non designated hedge and would continue to be marked to market in the consolidated statements of condition as an asset or liability  in the consolidated statements of income with any changes in the mark to market recorded through current period earnings and not through oci 
counter party credit risk associated with derivatives is controlled by dealing with well established brokers that are highly rated by credit rating agencies and by establishing exposure limits for individual counter parties 
market risk on interest rate swaps is minimized by using these instruments as hedges and by continually monitoring the positions to ensure ongoing effectiveness 
credit risk is controlled by entering into bilateral collateral agreements with brokers  in which the parties pledge collateral to indemnify the counter party in the case of default 
the corporation s hedging activities and strategies are monitored by the bank s asset liability committee alco as part of its oversight of the treasury function 
goodwill and intangible assets for acquisitions  the corporation records the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective  as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired by the corporation 
the corporation tests goodwill annually for impairment 
such tests involve the use of estimates and assumptions 
intangible assets other than goodwill  such as deposit based intangibles which are determined to have finite lives  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which is approximately years 
asset prepayment rates the corporation purchases amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
prepayment rate projections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes under the asset liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
effective january   the corporation adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin no 
 which prescribes the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
provides guidance for derecognition and classification of previously recognized tax positions that did not meet certain recognition criteria in addition to recognition of interest and penalties  if necessary 
financial condition the financial condition of the corporation reflects the strong focus on business development and the execution of the corporation s strategic priorities and strengthening the balance sheet by growing loans and customer deposits in the bank s core business segments and key major markets of greater baltimore  greater washington  dc and central virginia 
solid growth in relationship based loan portfolios loans other than the corporation s originated and acquired residential mortgage loans was a reflection of the corporation s ability to grow the loan portfolio in these key markets through its lending expertise and focus on its premier loan programs home equity  commercial real estate  and commercial business 
the corporation was also successful in retaining customer deposits in a very competitive deposit market 
the expanded market presence the corporation has experienced since has been successful in helping to grow and deepen customer relationships 
these efforts have led to growth in average relationship based loans of million  or  and average customer deposits of million or  over in  average customer deposits reflect the impact from the deposit sale of million in september at december   total assets were billion  while total loans and deposits were billion and billion  respectively 
based on the corporation s strategy  growth in internally generated loan portfolios has replaced the decline in wholesale assets originated and acquired residential mortgages and investment securities as the corporation strengthens the balance sheet by growing relationship based portfolios and de emphasizing wholesale assets 
over the past few years  capital growth has been a specific focus for the corporation 
tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets was at december   a decline from at december  the decline in tangible common equity in is mainly attributable to a million pre tax write down of a significant portion of the corporation s million reit trust preferred securities portfolio 
going forward  management will continue to focus on growing tangible common equity 
the tangible common equity ratio is a non gaap measure used to determine capital adequacy 
tangible common equity is total equity less net accumulated other comprehensive income oci  goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and deposit based intangibles 
the tangible common equity ratio is calculated by removing the impact of oci and certain intangible assets from total equity and total assets 
management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets  typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method accounting for mergers and acquisitions 
management believes this is an important benchmark for the corporation and for investors 
neither tangible common equity  tangible assets nor the related measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders equity  total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
moreover  the manner in which the corporation calculates its tangible common equity  tangible assets and the related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names 
the following table is a reconciliation of the corporation s tangible common equity and tangible assets for the periods ended december  and december  dollars in thousands december  december  total equity capital per consolidated financial statements accumulated other comprehensive loss goodwill deposit based intangible tangible common equity total assets per consolidated financial statements goodwill deposit based intangible tangible assets tangible common equity ratio earning assets total average earning assets were billion for the year ending december   a decline of million  or  from the year ending december  the following table summarizes the composition of the bank s average earning assets for the periods indicated 
average earning assets year ended december  dollars in thousands variance variance investments other earning assets residential real estate originated and acquired residential mortgage home equity other consumer marine other total consumer commercial real estate commercial mortgage residential construction commercial construction commercial business total commercial total loans total average earning assets the decline in total average earning assets of million is attributable to the million decrease in average investment securities that resulted primarily from the balance sheet restructuring that occurred in fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the corporation sold million of its investment securities portfolio as part of a balance sheet restructuring plan to improve future profitability and to reduce investments in wholesale assets 
the decline was partially offset by the growth in total average loans of million 
total average loans increased  the net effect of a million increase  or  in commercial loans  partially offset by a decline of million  or  in consumer loans 
the corporation continues to produce strong organic loan growth 
average relationship based loans increased million  or  over the corporation s focus on business development and developing lending relationships that are provided by the market opportunity  combined with the experience of lending officers in the market  has been demonstrated by the strong and balanced regional growth in commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
these results reflect the corporation s strategy to grow and deepen customer relationships in all market segments 
overall  there is a relatively balanced mix of lending revenue sources between the two product segments with billion  or  in average commercial loans and billion  or  in average consumer loans 
the diversity of lending products should provide the corporation with opportunities to emphasize certain product lines as market conditions change 
commercial loans  which are a key component to the corporation s regional presence in its market area  grew million  or  over residential and commercial construction loans posted increases during the year of million and million  respectively  reflecting the balanced growth in the regional real estate construction markets 
in addition  commercial business loans grew million  or  while commercial mortgages declined million  or 
the solid loan growth within the corporation s footprint is a reflection of the group s ability to expand existing and generate new lending relationships 
these expanded relationships and associated risks are managed through stringent loan administration and credit monitoring by an experienced credit management staff 
the decline in average consumer loans of million included the planned reductions in originated and acquired residential mortgages of million 
average relationship based consumer loans loans other than originated and acquired residential mortgages increased  or million 
home equity lending is the main contributor to this loan growth 
the variety of home equity loan products  along with the corporation s relationship sales approach and competitive pricing have proven to be successful in the corporation s markets 
this market strategy resulted in the million  or  increase in home equity average balances 
the production of direct consumer loans  primarily home equity loans and lines  are generated by the bank s retail banking offices  phone centers  the internet and selected pre qualified brokers 
origination of consumer loan and line commitments  primarily home equity  in the greater washington and central virginia regions  grew over while average consumer loan and line commitments from the greater baltimore market declined by in other consumer loans  which make up of total consumer loans mainly marine lending  declined million in management has chosen to limit marine lending loan growth due to low pricing margins in the industry 
the corporation s portfolio of originated and acquired residential mortgage loans consisting of first mortgages  home equity loans and lines represented of average total loans in  compared to in at december   approximately of the acquired portfolio was in first lien position 
average balances in the originated and acquired residential mortgage portfolio continued to decline during  to million  as the bank retains only a small percentage of new residential mortgage loan originations and its purchases of loans have not been material 
the investment securities portfolio average balance declined by million in compared to as management continued executing its strategy of replacing wholesale investments with internally generated loans 
from year end to year end  the corporation s investment securities portfolio declined by million  or from to of total assets 
investment purchases  which totaled million  were allocated among abs  municipal bonds  and non agency cmos  and agency mbs 
investment purchases were funded through sales of mbs  fnma debentures  and floating rate abs totaling million  and maturities and paydowns of million 
in december  the corporation wrote down its million reit trust preferred securities portfolio by million after making a determination that million of the total was other than temporarily impaired 
the corporation will continue to evaluate the investment ratings in the securities portfolio and the dealer price quotes 
based upon these and other factors  the securities portfolio may experience further impairment 
management currently has the intent and ability to retain its investment securities with unrealized losses until the decline in value has been recovered 
asset quality the following table presents information with respect to non performing assets and day delinquencies for the years indicated

as a percentage of total loans  non performing assets to loans increased from to 
the million non performing residential real estate construction loans are comprised of a million loan to a virginia land developer  which is substantially collateralized  and another land development loan for thousand 
the increase in non performing commercial business loans is due mainly from two non performing loans added during the year that were offset by a million write off of a non performing loan that was outstanding as of december  non performing commercial business loans include million of loans that have us government guarantees 
non performing loans as a percentage of each portfolio s outstanding balances were as follows december  originated acquired residential mortgage home equity other consumer total consumer commercial mortgage residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial business total commercial total loans the corporation has a fairly diversified portfolio  consisting of a commercial real estate loan portfolio composed of commercial mortgages  commercial construction and residential construction that are within geographically different markets of baltimore  suburban washington and richmond 
the diversified portfolio mitigates some of the exposure to the housing market 
in addition  management s conservative credit policies and the shift to relationship based loan portfolios also mitigates credit risk in the corporation s loan portfolio 
overall  asset quality ratios of the corporation at december  are not excessive  but no assurances can be given regarding the level of non performing assets in the future 
total day delinquencies decreased by million in to million  and as a result  total day delinquencies as a percentage of total loans outstanding were in compared to in the decline was mainly concentrated in the originated and acquired residential mortgage and other consumer portfolios

the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any type of loan 
allocation of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands consumer commercial real estate mortgage residential real estate construction commercial real estate construction commercial business unallocated total allowance for loan losses as a result of the weakening regional residential housing market  higher delinquencies and non performing assets  along with the potential for higher levels of non performing assets  management determined that an increase in its allowance for loan losses was necessary in accordingly  the provision for loan losses was increased million in net charge offs for were million compared to million in for  the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by million 
the allowance as a percentage of loans outstanding increased from at december  to at december   while the allowance coverage decreased to of non performing loans at december   compared to at december  portfolio wide net charge offs showed a year over year increase and were of average loans in  up from in this increase is mainly due to the million increase in net charge offs in the commercial business portfolio 
during  the commercial business portfolio experienced two significant charge offs  a million fraudulent loan and a million long standing non performing loan 
during  the allowance for loan loss increased million to million 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses at december  increased million  while the portion allocated to the residential real estate construction portfolio increased by million 
the increase in the unallocated portion reflects the increased uncertainty in the local housing market and more specifically within the corporation s loan portfolio 
the increase in the allocation to the residential real estate construction was due to the downgrading of risk ratings for certain loans and qualitative adjustments in this portfolio 
management believes that the allowance at december  represents its best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio and that it uses relevant information available to make such determinations 
if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making determinations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be affected 
based on information currently available to the corporation  management believes it has established its existing allowance in accordance with gaap 
because events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases to the allowance will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
sources of funds the following table summarizes the composition of the corporation s average deposit and borrowing balances for the periods indicated

increased competition for deposits and the current rate environment were the main reasons for the moderate growth in average customer deposits 
in addition  the million deposit sale in september negatively impacted average total deposits by million in in  consumer certificates of deposit and money market deposits increased million and million  respectively and were partially offset by a million decline in low cost sources of consumer deposits 
commercial certificates of deposit also increased in  growing million  or  while all other sources of commercial deposits declined by million 
the decline in total commercial deposits resulted from a significant drop in real estate title company activity and commercial customers shifting more of their available deposits to alternative investments 
during  consumer and commercial customers continued to shift their deposits away from low yielding checking and savings accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit accounts or moving their deposits to alternative markets 
the change in deposit mix is driven by the current rate environment and the level of competition for deposits 
in  average borrowings declined by million  or  from the decline was mainly in the fhlb borrowing portfolio and was partly financed by the increase in brokered certificates of deposit 
throughout much of  brokered certificates of deposit were priced at rates at or below the libor rate curve  while variable rate long term borrowings were priced essentially flat to the libor rate curve 
liquidity an important component of the corporation s asset liability structure is the level of liquidity available to meet the needs of customers and creditors 
traditional sources of bank liquidity include deposit growth  loan repayments  investment maturities  asset sales  borrowings and interest received 
management believes the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet future funding needs 
the corporation s chief source of liquidity is the assets it possesses  which can either be pledged as collateral for secured borrowings or sold outright 
at december   over million of the corporation s investment portfolio was immediately saleable at a market value equaling or exceeding its amortized cost basis 
additionally  over a day time frame  a majority of the corporation s billion consumer and residential loan portfolios is saleable under normal conditions 
as an alternative to asset sales  the corporation has the ability to pledge assets to raise secured borrowings 
at december   million of secured borrowings were employed  with sufficient collateral available to raise an additional million from the fhlb atlanta  the federal reserve s term auction facility and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
additionally  over million of borrowing capacity exists at the federal reserve discount window as a contingent funding source 
the corporation also employs unsecured funding sources such as fed funds and brokered certificates of deposit 
at december   million fed funds were employed  with sufficient funding lines in place to purchase an additional million 
at december   the corporation had million of brokered certificates of deposit outstanding 
a significant use of the corporation s liquidity is the dividends it pays to shareholders 
the corporation is a one bank holding company that relies upon the bank s performance to generate capital growth through bank earnings 
a portion of the bank s earnings is passed to the corporation in the form of cash dividends 
as a commercial bank under the maryland financial institution law  the bank may declare cash dividends from undivided profits or  with the prior approval of the commissioner of financial regulation  out of paid in capital in excess of of its required capital stock  and after providing for due or accrued expenses  losses  interest and taxes 
these dividends paid to the holding company are utilized to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase shares and pay interest on junior subordinated debentures 
the corporation and the bank  in declaring and paying dividends  are also limited insofar as minimum capital requirements of regulatory authorities must be maintained 
the corporation and the bank comply with such capital requirements 
if the corporation or the bank were unable to comply with the minimum capital requirements  it could result in regulatory actions that could have a material impact on the corporation 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various contractual obligations  such as long term borrowings  that are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain minimum lease payments for the use of banking and operations offices under operating lease agreements  are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
each of these arrangements affects the corporation s determination of sufficient liquidity 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the following table 
contractual payments due by period in thousands less than year years years after years total lease commitments note certificates of deposit note long term debt note total contractual payment obligations arrangements to fund credit products or guarantee financing take the form of loan commitments including lines of credit on revolving credit structures and letters of credit 
approvals for these arrangements are obtained in the same manner as loans 
generally  cash flows  collateral value and a risk assessment are considered when determining the amount and structure of credit arrangements 
commitments to extend credit in the form of consumer  commercial real estate and business loans at december  were as follows in thousands commercial business and real estate consumer revolving credit residential mortgage credit performance standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total loan commitments historically  many of the commitments expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
obligations also take the form of commitments to purchase loans 
at december   the corporation did not have any firm commitments to purchase loans 
contingencies and risk the corporation enters into certain transactions that may either contain risks or represent contingencies 
these risks or contingencies may take the form of concentrations of credit risk or litigation 
disclosure of these arrangements is found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk management interest rate risk the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings and the market value of assets and liabilities are subject to fluctuations  which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize the fluctuation in the net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates using cost effective strategies and tools 
the bank manages several forms of interest rate risk  including asset liability mismatch  basis risk and prepayment risk 
management continually monitors prime libor basis risk and asset liability mismatch 
basis risk exists as a result of having much of the bank s earning assets priced using either the prime rate or the us treasury yield curve  while much of the liability portfolio  which finances earning assets  is priced using the certificates of deposit yield curve or libor yield curve 
these different yield curves are highly correlated but do not move in lock step with one another 
additionally  management routinely monitors and limits the mismatch between assets and liabilities subject to repricing on a monthly  quarterly  semiannual and annual basis 
the corporation both purchases and originates amortizing loan pools and investment securities in which the underlying assets are residential mortgage loans subject to prepayments 
the actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the expected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from borrowers elections to refinance the underlying mortgages based on market and other conditions 
prepayment rate projections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like kind instruments 
the prepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums or discounts on the related assets 
changes in prepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held  creating volatility in the net interest margin 
prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect actual activity and the most recent market projections 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that management performs continually to meet the objective of maintaining a stable net interest margin 
this process relies chiefly on simulation modeling of shocks to the balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios  including parallel and non parallel rate shifts  such as the forward yield curves for both short and long term interest rates 
the results of these shocks are measured in two forms first  the impact on the net interest margin and earnings over one and two year time frames  and second  the impact on the market value of equity 
in addition to measuring the basis risks and prepayment risks noted above  simulations also quantify the earnings impact of rate changes and the cost benefit of hedging strategies 
the following table shows the anticipated effect on net interest income in parallel shift up or down interest rate scenarios 
these shifts are assumed to begin on january  for the december  data and on january  for the december  data and evenly ramp up or down over a six month period 
the effect on net interest income would be for the next twelve months 
projected percentage change in net interest income at december interest rate scenario basis points basis points no change basis points basis points the projected outcomes presented above are based on a balance sheet growth forecast and parallel shifts in interest rates  ie all interest rates moving by the same amount 
management models many non parallel rate change scenarios as well  including several yield curve flattening and steepening scenarios 
the results of each scenario differ  however  the results above are an accurate indication of the magnitude and direction of the corporation s interest rate risk 
the percentage changes displayed in the table above relate to the corporation s projected net interest income 
management s intent is for derivative interest income to mitigate risk to the corporation s net interest income stemming from changes in interest rates 
for comparison purposes  these projections include all interest earned on derivatives in net interest income 
the analysis includes the interest income or expense relating to non designated interest rate swaps that is classified in non interest income as net cash settlement on swaps 
the isolated modeling environment  assuming no action by management  shows that the corporation s net interest income volatility is less than 
at january   us treasury securities yields have fallen to their lowest levels since  with year notes at 
it is management s view that the probability of a basis point decline in long term interest rates from this level is quite remote 
the above results do not include the affects of potential management decisions to offset the risk to falling rates  such as calling fixed rate borrowings 
for example  the corporation currently has million of fixed rate fhlb borrowings  and million of brokered cds that are callable at management s discretion  and could be re issued at lower rates in the falling rate scenarios 
management employs the investment  borrowing  and derivatives portfolios in implementing the corporation s interest rate strategy 
mitigating yield curve inversion risk has been a significant element of interest rate risk management 
to protect the corporation from rising short term interest rates  over million of the investment portfolio reprices semiannually or more frequently 
in the borrowings portfolio  million of funds reset their rates with long term interest rates  such as the year constant maturity swap rate  to protect the net interest margin from falling long term interest rates 
the interest expense associated with these borrowings declines when long term interest rates decline 
additionally  at december   million of interest rate swaps were in force to reduce interest rate risk  and million of interest rate caps were employed specifically to protect against rising interest rates in the future 
credit risk much of the fundamental lending business of provident is based upon understanding  measuring and controlling credit risk 
in addition to managing interest rate risk  which applies to both assets and liabilities  the corporation must understand and manage risks specific to lending 
credit risk entails both general risks  which are inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit loss based on historical loss experience 
home mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience 
loans with medium credit loss experience are primarily secured products such as auto and marine loans 
unsecured loan products such as personal revolving credit have the highest credit loss experience  therefore the bank has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending 
credit risk in commercial lending varies significantly  as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely from period to period and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
generally improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers  enhancing their ability to meet debt service requirements 
however  this improvement in operating cash flow is often at least partially offset by rising interest rates often seen in an improving economic environment 
in addition  changing economic conditions often impact various business segments differently  giving rise to the need to manage industry concentrations within the loan portfolio 
to control and manage credit risk  management has set high credit standards along with an in house administration and strong oversight procedures along with a cautious approach to adopting products before they have been sufficiently tested in the marketplace 
in addition  the corporation maintains a fairly balanced portfolio concentration between home equity  commercial and residential real estate and commercial business loans 
the corporation s assessment of the loan portfolio s credit risk and asset quality is measured by its levels of delinquencies  non performing asset levels and charge offs 
at december   the day delinquency level was million  or of total loans  down by million  or from december  non performing assets were million  or of loans compared to as of december  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans for the year ending december  were compared to for the year ending december  further discussion relating to asset quality is presented in financial condition asset quality on page and on page in investment portfolio credit quality 
other lending risks in addition to credit risk  the other significant risk in the investment portfolio is duration risk 
duration measures the expected change in the market value of an investment for a basis point or change in interest rates 
the higher an investment s duration  the longer the time until its rate is reset to current market rates 
the bank s risk tolerance  as measured by the duration of the investment portfolio  is typically between and 
the portfolio duration is currently and is likely to decline in if interest rates continue to fall causing mbs prepayments to accelerate 
other lending risks include liquidity risk and specific risk 
the liquidity risk of the corporation arises from its obligation to make payment in the event of a customer s contractual default 
the evaluation of specific risk is a basic function of underwriting and loan administration  involving analysis of the borrower s ability to service debt as well as the value of pledged collateral 
in addition to impacting individual lending decisions  this analysis may also determine the aggregate level of commitments the corporation is willing to extend to an individual customer or a group of related customers 
capital resources total stockholders equity was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the change in stockholders equity for the year was attributable to million in earnings that was more than offset by dividends declared or paid of million and an increase in net accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  primarily due to the impact on the decline in fair value of the debt securities portfolio from the current illiquid market

the write down was also based on the corporation s analysis of the individual securities credit risk surrounding the residential mortgage and homebuilding industries and the resulting risk with respect to collection of future interest or principal payments on these securities 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further update on the corporation s reit pooled trust preferred portfolio 
incremental loan loss provision as a result of the weakening regional residential housing market  higher delinquencies and non performing assets along with the potential for a higher level of non performing assets  management determined that an additional million pre tax provision for loan losses was prudent in the fourth quarter in view of the market conditions and the potential implications with respect to the loan portfolio 
state income tax in november  the maryland state legislature enacted an increase in the corporate state tax rate from to 
as a result  the corporation adjusted the value of its deferred tax asset for the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards in future periods and for the change in the corporate state tax rate  resulting in a decline in income tax expense of million 
corporate wide efficiency program during  the corporation implemented a corporate wide efficiency and infrastructure initiative that was focused on the rationalization of the branch network  the composition and execution of fee generation activities and the creation of efficiencies in the corporation s business model 
the corporation incurred million expense relating to this initiative for consulting costs and restructuring costs 
the actions taken by this program contributed approximately million in expense savings and revenue enhancements in gain on sale of branches and deposits during  the corporation closed seven branches and sold one branch facility

the financial results in reflect the impact of the significant activity discussed above but it also includes the successful efforts from all lines of business to produce strong growth in relationship based loans  maintain customer deposits in a competitive deposit market and increase core fee income 
the corporation continues to be committed to produce positive core results through the execution of the key business strategies of broadening its presence and customer base in the virginia and metropolitan washington markets  growing commercial business in all markets  and enhancing core business results 
net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits in order to provide a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the following table presents information regarding the average balance of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest earning assets and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and costs 
the yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented

impact of designated hedging strategies on interest income and interest expense has been included in the appropriate classifications above 
tax equivalent basis 
the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased basis points to from in the decline was primarily caused by the shift in deposit mix as customers continued to move balances away from lower yielding checking and savings accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit and the impact from competition on rates paid on deposits 
the deposit mix change and the rates paid on deposits are primarily due to the current yield curve environment and the intense competition for deposits 
over the past to months the corporation s customers have been taking advantage of the higher deposit rates associated with certificates of deposit 
the favorable yield impact of replacing lower yielding net interest earning wholesale assets with higher yielding assets has been offset by the negative impact from the change in deposit mix 
the securities and debt restructuring transaction that occurred in the fourth quarter of has mitigated some of the impact on the net interest margin caused by the change in deposit mix 
year over year average earning assets declined slightly to billion as a result of strong internally generated loan growth being more than funded by the planned reductions in wholesale assets 
the net loan growth of million in relationship based loans was offset by planned reductions of million in originated and acquired loans and a million reduction in investment securities 
the yields on investments and loans grew and basis points  respectively 
the yield increase in the loan and investment portfolios resulted from the increase in year over year market interest rates and the composition of these portfolios 
interest bearing liabilities declined by million while the average rate paid increased by basis points 
the increase in the average rate paid was primarily due to the shift in deposit mix in addition to the rise in interest rates that impacted interest bearing demand deposits  money market deposits  time deposits and long term debt 
interest expense was also negatively impacted by a million decline in average noninterest bearing demand deposit balances during the year as customers shifted their deposits to interest bearing deposits 
the yield on earning assets increased basis points from as a result of rising interest rates and the change in asset mix  but was more than offset by the increased cost on total interest bearing liabilities of basis points to 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million in compared to million in total interest income increased by million and total interest expense increased by million resulting in a decline in net interest income of million 
growth in the key loan portfolios of home equity  commercial real estate and business banking and the impact of rising rates were the primary drivers of the million increase in total interest income 
the impact from rising rates and the change in deposit mix towards higher yielding certificates of deposit from lower yielding checking and savings accounts were the primary causes of the increase in interest expense of million 
future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand  growth in deposits and the general level of interest rates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for the year ending december  compared to million for the year ending december  the million growth in the provision for loan loss in was the result of the weakening local residential housing sector  increased net charge offs and non performing assets along with overall loan growth 
the corporation continues to emphasize quality underwriting as well as aggressive management of charge offs and potential problem loans within this uncertain market to minimize the exposure to charge offs 
in  net charge offs were million  or of average loans  compared to million  or of average loans  in the increase reflects a million charge off of a fraudulent commercial business loan and a million charge off of a long term non performing commercial business loan 
in addition  net charge offs in the consumer loans portfolio increased million over total consumer loan net charge offs as a percentage of average total consumer loans were in  compared to in total commercial loan net charge offs as a percentage of average commercial loans were  an increase from in the increase in charge offs in both the consumer and commercial portfolios is a reflection of the weakening regional housing market and the impact of the two significant charge offs in the commercial business portfolio

the net cash settlement also related to these derivatives which represents interest income and expense on non designated interest rate swaps are recorded as part of non interest income 
the net derivative activities associated with these derivatives were a net gain of thousand for the year ending december   compared to a net gain of thousand gain in during the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a million impairment of its million reit trust preferred securities portfolio 
the impairment was based on declines in recent dealer quotes  severe downgrades from the rating agencies and based on the corporation s analysis of the individual securities credit risk surrounding the residential mortgage and homebuilding industries which created increased risk with respect to collection of future interest or principal payments

these declines were partially offset by increases in professional services totaling million and million in restructuring activities costs 
the million decrease in salaries and benefits was driven primarily by lower average staffing levels of approximately positions over the past months as a result of actions taken by the corporate efficiency program 
base salary expense declined million due to the lower number of full time equivalent employees concentrated in the consumer banking and organizational support groups  partially offset by annual merit increases 
salary and employee benefits expense were also positively impacted by a million decline in health care costs and thousand in payroll taxes 
these declines in expenses were partially offset by increases in stock based payments totaling thousand due to stock options and restricted shares granted during the year 
in addition  pension expense increased thousand and the corporation s k match increased by thousand in occupancy expense increased thousand over due to higher building and service repairs  rent escalation costs on existing leases and the termination of a sublease agreement 
furniture and equipment expense decreased thousand due to lower personal property taxes and leased equipment depreciation while printing and supplies expense increased by thousand over professional services increased million over primarily as result of million in consulting costs associated with the corporate wide efficiency program and million in legal costs  mainly from additional legal costs incurred relating to indemnification obligations assumed in connection with the acquisition of southern financial bancorp in april these increases were offset by a million decline in corporate governance compliance efforts  including sarbanes oxley and other regulatory requirements 
restructuring activities costs were million in  consisted of branch closure costs and severance costs associated with staff reductions that were incurred through actions taken by the corporate wide efficiency program

income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes under the asset liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become realizable 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgment about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term
