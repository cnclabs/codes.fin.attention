overview we provide vehicle sellers  with a full range of remarketing services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation  or vb  internet auction style sales technology  which we refer to as vb sellers are primarily insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions  charities  car dealerships  fleet operators  vehicle rental companies and the general public 
we sell principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters  however at certain locations  we sell directly to the general public 
the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of the insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle sellers a full range of remarketing services that expedite each stage of the salvage vehicle sales process and minimize administrative and processing costs 
in the united states  or us  we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
in the united kingdom  or uk  we operate primarily on a principal basis  purchasing the salvage vehicle outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicle for our own account 
our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues 
revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling the vehicles regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or  under our percentage incentive program  or pip program  our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price 
under the fixed fee program  we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation 
although sometimes included in the consignment fee  we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility  storage of the vehicle  and other incidental costs 
under the consignment programs  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue  not the actual sales price gross proceeds 
sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenue  includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and are primarily generated in the uk 
operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  equipment maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
because we operate as a principal in the uk  purchasing and reselling salvaged vehicles for our own account  we expect operating costs to increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management  accounting  data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees  research and development and marketing expenses 
during fiscal and fiscal  we converted all of our north american and united kingdom vehicle remarketing facilities  respectively  to an internet based auction style model using our vb internet sales technology 
this process employs a two step bidding process 
the first step  called the preliminary bid  allows buyers to submit bids up to one hour before a real time virtual auction begins 
the second step allows buyers to bid against each other  and the high bidder from the preliminary bidding process  in a real time process over the internet 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our public auction business motors auction group  or mag  and dispose of or convert the related assets 
the mag yards converted into salvage facilities will continue to be included in the results of continuing operations on the income statements 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twenty three vehicle storage facilities and established thirteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
as part of this strategy  in fiscal  we acquired eight new facilities in the uk located in peterlee  wisbech  rochford  york  inverkeithing  whitburn  featherstone and doncaster and in north america  we acquired one facility in sikeston  missouri and opened six new facilities in london  ontario  windsor  new jersey  walton  kentucky  birmingham  alabama  minneapolis  minnesota and prairie grove  arkansas 
in fiscal  we acquired seven new facilities in the uk located in sandy  sandtoft  sandwich  westbury  chester  denny  and wootton and in north america we opened new facilities in baltimore  maryland  woodburn  oregon  and punta gorda  florida 
in fiscal  we acquired new facilities in or near greenwood  nebraska  grand island  nebraska  york haven  pennsylvania  chambersburg  pennsylvania  altoona  pennsylvania  fruitland  maryland  billings  montana and opened new facilities in or near honolulu  hawaii  lansing  michigan  dover  florida and jacksonville  florida 
the denny  doncaster and featherstone facilities were closed prior to july  we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america and the united kingdom and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 
in april  we completed the acquisition of simpson bros 
york holdings limited  a united kingdom limited liability company simpson  which operates one location in york  england 
simpson s primary business activity was the dismantling of automobiles and the sales of salvaged auto parts 
in the same month  we also completed the acquisition of bob lowe salvage pool  inc  which operates one location in sikeston  missouri 
in february  we completed the purchase of the assets and business of ag watson auto salvage motors spares scotland limited ag watson which operates two salvage locations in scotland and two salvage locations in northern england 
in august  we completed the acquisition of century salvage sales limited century  a vehicle salvage disposal company with three facilities located in the uk 
the total consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired 
on june   we acquired all the issued share capital of universal salvage plc  or universal  for per share approximately based on currency exchange rates on june  
universal  based in the uk and operating exclusively within the uk  is a service provider to the motor insurance and automotive industries 
the aggregate acquisition consideration paid by us totaled approximately million approximately million based on currency exchange rates on june  and was funded from our available cash resources 
we also assumed outstanding indebtedness of universal totaling approximately million million as of june  
the acquisition was our first acquisition outside north america and included the seven facilities discussed above 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions  new openings  weather and product introductions during such periods 
in particular  the uk acquisition  because of its size and  also  because the uk operates primarily on the principal model versus the agency model employed in the united states  will have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues and gross margin percentages in future periods 
in addition to growth through acquisitions  we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing new vehicle storage facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and buyers  and iv expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income presented in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region based on the location of the selling entity in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue north america united kingdom revenues from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal revenue growth from same store sales in north america  those opened before august   was approximately million 
revenue growth from new facilities in north america  those opened or acquired after august   including facilities in or near london  ontario  windsor  new jersey  walton  kentucky  birmingham  alabama  minneapolis  minnesota  sikeston  missouri and prairie grove  arkansas was approximately million 
of the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  million was attributable to revenues generated in the uk 
we entered the uk market through four acquisitions  the first being the acquisition of universal salvage in june prior to that transaction  we had no uk operations 
in the uk  we operate primarily on a principle basis purchasing cars outright and reselling them for our own account 
under this method  the total amount of the selling price and the total amount of the cost of the car are reflected in the results of operations 
in north america  we operate primarily on an agency basis  selling the car on behalf of the seller and collecting only a service fee 
under this method only the earned fee is included in the results of operations  not the gross selling price and the cost of the car 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in yard expenses is depreciation expense of million  of which million was attributable to the uk operations and represents an increase of million over fiscal in north america  yard operation expense  excluding depreciation  increased by million and was attributable to the increase in the volume of cars processed 
uk operations generated yard operating expenses of million 
yard operation expenses increased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal in the uk  we operate primarily on a principle basis purchasing the vehicle outright and reselling them for our own account 
accordingly  the purchase price of the vehicle  which was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  is reflected in our yard operating expenses 
because the uk operates primarily on the principle basis  its gross margin percentage is significantly lower than the gross margin percentage of the us 
approximately of the vehicles processed in the uk during the year were purchased cars 
the following sets forth information on gross margin  defined as revenue less yard operation expenses  and percentage of gross margin by geographic region in thousands  except percentages percentage of gross margin percentage of gross margin north america united kingdom general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in general and administrative expenses is depreciation and amortization of million  an increase of million over fiscal there were two primary drivers for the growth in general and administrative expenses 
the first was the additional management  finance  technology  systems and administrative resources required in both the us and in the uk to support the uk operations 
the second is the growth in the number of programmers  systems administrators and systems resources required to accelerate the development and deployment of the enhancements to vb and to our seller support software and interfaces 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal general and administrative expenses include amortization expense relating to intangible assets acquired as part of the uk acquisitions 
other income 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million from fiscal the decrease is due primarily to a million decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates and a lower average cash and investment balance offset by million in losses from an equity investment in lanelogic corporation lanelogic last year 
other income  which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of assets  increased approximately million 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region based on the location of the selling entity in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue north america united kingdom revenues from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or over fiscal revenue growth from same store sales in north america  those opened before august   was approximately million 
revenue growth from new facilities in north america  those opened after august   including facilities in or near baltimore  maryland  woodburn  oregon  and punta gorda  florida was approximately million 
of the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  million was attributable to revenues generated in the uk from june   the date of our first acquisition in the uk 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses from continuing operations were approximately million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in yard expenses is depreciation expense of million  an increase of million over fiscal yard operation expenses decreased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal the decreases in yard expenses  excluding depreciation  were primarily attributable to the decrease in incremental abnormal costs incurred as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita during fiscal these additional inventory type costs were approximately million during fiscal as compared to million during the fiscal  and were charged to yard operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
these costs include the additional subhauling  payroll  equipment and facilities expenses directly related to the operating conditions created by the hurricanes 
these costs do not include normal expenses associated with the increased unit volume created by the hurricanes  which are deferred until the sale of the units and are recognized as vehicle pooling costs on the balance sheet 
as of july   all of the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of the hurricanes katrina and rita have been sold 
in addition  yard operation expenses include costs attributable to the uk of million 
the uk operates primarily on a principal basis and  accordingly has a lower gross margin percentage 
the following sets forth information on gross margin  defined as revenue less yard operation expenses  and percentage of gross margin by geographic region in thousands  except percentages percentage of gross margin percentage of gross margin north america united kingdom general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were approximately million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal included in general and administrative expenses is depreciation and amortization of million an increase of million over fiscal also included are general and administrative costs attributable to the uk operations 
other increases were due to increased payroll costs  professional services and general corporate expansion 
these increases were offset by decreased operating lease costs on computer equipment leases  which were bought out during the year and a reduction in legal costs 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal general and administrative expenses include amortization expense relating to the universal acquisition 
other income 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million from fiscal the increase is due primarily to a million increase in interest income due to higher interest rates and a higher average cash and investments balance and a decrease of million in losses from an equity investment in lanelogic corporation lanelogic 
other income  which consists primarily of rental income and gain on the sales of assets  increased approximately million 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of fiscal including a non recurring million out of period reduction  to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense originating primarily in and prior years 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations declined million from fiscal to fiscal as we discontinued our mag operations and disposed of or converted all the related assets during fiscal there were no such disposals in fiscal net income 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
cash and cash equivalents combined with short term investments decreased by approximately million from july  to july   primarily as a result of cash used for the acquisitions of century salvage  ag watson and simpson bros  purchases of property and equipment and repurchases of common stock which was offset by cash generated from continuing operations 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers fees  buyers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of sold vehicles 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash  and cash equivalents of approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the increase in net income which was offset in part by the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to the increase in net income which was offset in part to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
the increase in net income is primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal and the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of million in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal during fiscal we consumed cash through the growth in accounts receivable and vehicle pooling costs and we generated cash through the growth in deferred revenue 
the movements in these accounts are driven primarily by the significant growth in vehicles held for sale which was impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
the decrease in net income is primarily a result of the loss on discontinued operations in the amount of million  which was offset in part by increased revenue 
investing activities during the fiscal years ended july   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million  respectively of short term investments  which were offset by the sale of million  million  million  respectively of short term investments 
we historically invested our cash in auction rate notes with ratings of aaa 
prior to october   the end of the first quarter of fiscal  we converted our entire balance of short term investments to cash and cash equivalents 
capital expenditures related to continuing operations excluding those associated with property and equipment attributable to acquisitions were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures are primarily related to opening and improving facilities and acquiring yard equipment 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisitions of century salvage sales limited  simpson bros 
york  ltd  ag watson auto salvage and motor spares scotland limited  and bob lowe s salvage pool 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used approximately million in cash for the acquisition of universal which includes the following seven locations in the uk sandy  sandtoft  sandwich  westbury  chester  denny  and wootton 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used cash for the acquisition of facilities in or near billings  montana  fruitland  maryland  altoona  pennsylvania  chambersburg  pennsylvania  york haven  pennsylvania  greenwood  nebraska and grand island  nebraska  which had an aggregate cash cost of approximately million 
during the year ended july   we invested approximately million for a equity interest in lanelogic  a delaware limited liability corporation lanelogic 
we have no further contractual funding commitment 
based on our evaluation of lanelogic and the related agreements  management believes that lanelogic does not constitute a variable interest entity as defined in fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
as a result  our investment has been accounted for under the equity method prescribed by apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our chairman and ceo  made a personal unsecured loan to lanelogic to prevent a restriction of working capital from disrupting its business as lanelogic sought additional equity financing 
the loan was repaid during the second quarter ended january  we concluded that the personal unsecured loan did not cause a change in the accounting of lanelogic as an equity method investment 
during the second quarter ended january   lanelogic received a strategic equity investment totaling approximately million from two new investment groups as well as lanelogic s founder 
we did not participate in this additional equity financing into lanelogic 
in addition  lanelogic converted from a limited liability company to a delaware corporation  of which we are now a stockholder 
on august   subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  our chairman and ceo provided a personal guaranty in favor of dealer services corporation as a condition for providing a credit facility to lanelogic  inc a corporation in which we have a less than controlling interest 
the guaranty was approved by our audit committee 
we have concluded that the personal guaranty does not cause a change in the accounting of lanelogic as an equity method investment 
dealer services corporation cancelled the personal guarantee prior to july  financing activities in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase program 
in fiscal  and  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  through changes in our book overdraft 
in february  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
in october  our board of directors approved a million share increase in our stock repurchase program bringing the total current number of shares authorized for repurchase to million shares 
the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the share repurchase program 
subject to applicable securities laws  such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time 
for the year ended july   we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of 
for the year ended july   we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of 
for the year ended july   we repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of 
from february through july   we repurchased a total of  shares at a weighted average price of 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other operating leases capital leases tax liabilities total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years other letters of credit contractual obligations consist of future non cancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases  used in the normal course of business 
tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
commercial commitments consists primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 
credit facilities on march   we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit agreement providing for a million revolving credit facility the credit facility  including a million foreign currency borrowing sublimit and a million letter of credit sublimit 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be used for repurchases of stock  capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility matures and all outstanding borrowings are due on the fifth anniversary of the credit agreement the maturity date  with annual reductions in availability of million on each of the first three anniversaries of the credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date and bear interest  at our option  at either eurocurrency rate plus to  depending of the leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  at the end of the previous quarter or at the us prime rate 
a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the commitment fee ranges from to depending on the leverage ratio as of the end on the previous quarter 
the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and places certain business operating restrictions on us relating to  among other things  indebtedness  liens and other encumbrances  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  and dividends  distributions and redemptions of capital stock 
in addition  the credit agreement provides for a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
the credit facility contains events of default that include  among others  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross defaults to certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency defaults  material judgments  invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control 
the credit facility is guaranteed by some of our domestic subsidiaries 
as of july   we did not have an outstanding balance under the credit facility 
as part of our acquisition of universal on june   we acquired three credit facilities with national westminster bank plc 
the first facility provides approximately million in overdraft protection and working capital 
the second and third facilities of approximately and million  respectively  provide liquidity for acquisitions and investments 
each of these facilities carries an interest rate of the bank s index  which was at july   plus 
and is collateralize by real property 
at july  there were no amounts borrowed under these facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  income taxes  long lived assets and self insured liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this form k 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer 
these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery  loading  title processing  preparation and storage 
we evaluate multiple element arrangements relative to our buyer and seller agreements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses accounting for multiple element arrangements  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which addresses revenue recognition for units of accounting 
the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller s behalf and under most of our current north american contracts  collecting the proceeds from the buyer 
we are not entitled to any such seller fees until we have collected the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller and  accordingly  we recognize revenue for seller services after service delivery and cash collection 
vehicle sales  where we purchase and remarket vehicles on our own behalf are recognized in accordance with sab on the sale date  which is typically the point of high bid acceptance 
upon high bid acceptance  a legal binding contract is formed with the buyer  and we record the gross sales price as revenue 
in certain cases  seller fees are not contingent upon collection of the seller proceeds from the buyer 
however  we determined that we are not able to separate the services into separate units of accounting because we do not have fair value for undelivered items 
as a result  we do not recognize seller fees until the final seller service has been delivered  which generally occurs upon collection of the sales proceeds from the buyer for the seller 
we provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle  charging a separate fee for each service 
each of these services has been assessed under the criteria of eitf to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multi element arrangement 
we have concluded that the sale and the post sale services are separate units of accounting 
the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale  and the fees for the post sale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the residual method 
we also charge buyers an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  and relist and late payment fees  which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the buyer 
no provision for returns has been established  as all sales are final with no right of return  although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non performance by our buyers or sellers 
vehicle pooling costs we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us  but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in the subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 inventory costs sfas to our vehicle pooling costs 
sfas requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal as provided in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or buyers and the inability of our sellers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our sellers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate the impairment of goodwill of our salvage sales operating segment  annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets we are subject to income taxes in the us  canada and uk 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
effective august   we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service and us states 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
long lived asset valuation  including intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method as required by sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions  measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued  be recognized in the financial statements 
determining the fair value of options using the black scholes model  or other currently accepted option valuation models  requires highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the grant date 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense  which could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations 
retained insurance liabilities we are partially self insured for certain losses related to medical  general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be impacted 
recently issued accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate and foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
as of july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable  a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
our exposure to foreign currency transactions gains and losses arises from the translation of the assets and liabilities of our canadian and uk subsidiaries to us dollars during consolidation 
we do not hedge our exposure to the canadian dollar or the british pound 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
