item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the year ended december  was very difficult 
we experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities  particularly costs for dairy products 
these cost increases totaled approximately million and reduced gross margin by approximately basis points 
we also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and trade up product segments that affected our growth and profitability 
in the face of these challenges  we did not have adequate product innovation and sufficient brand support or retail execution in our core us market 
additionally  we continued to invest in key international markets 
net sales were even with the prior year as increased sales from our international businesses and incremental sales from the acquisition of the godrej hershey foods and beverages company were substantially offset by lower sales in the united states 
net sales declined in the united states primarily as a result of increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity 
income and earnings per share were significantly lower than primarily as a result of a lower gross margin reflecting substantially higher input costs  principally related to higher costs for dairy products and certain other raw materials  and reduced price realization resulting from increased promotional costs  partly offset by lower costs associated with our supply chain productivity improvements 
increased investment spending for advertising and expansion of our international infrastructure also contributed to the lower income in non gaap financial measures items affecting comparability our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for each of these non gaap financial measures  we are providing below the most directly comparable gaap measure  a reconciliation of the differences between the non gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure  an explanation of why our management believes these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors  and additional purposes for which we use these non gaap measures 
we believe that the disclosure of these non gaap measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year to year operating results 
we exclude the effects of certain items from income before interest and income taxes ebit  net income and income per share diluted common stock eps when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally  and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business 
we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business 
items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in    and associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves

the acquisition of godrej hershey foods and beverages company increased net sales by million  or  in favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales 
these increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the us  reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity 
decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slow moving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the us compared with us confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales 
sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase 
sales in also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the united states implemented in  substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in mexico also contributed to the sales increase 
these increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in canada  partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier 
key marketplace metrics for the weeks ended december  consumer takeaway increase market share decrease increase 
table of contents consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately of our us confectionery retail business

the gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in compared with  resulting in a reduction of percentage points 
the rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials  offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity 
also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs 
compared with the sales volume increase  higher energy  raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for higher costs associated with obsolete  aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase 
these increases were offset somewhat by reductions in us manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of million in resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives 
business realignment charges of million were included in cost of sales in reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in las piedras  puerto rico 
gross margin in was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials  increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix 
these were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity 
our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin percentage point in and reduced gross margin by percentage points in selling  marketing and administrative compared with selling  marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses  partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses 
project implementation costs related to our business realignment initiatives contributed million to the increase 
higher administrative costs were principally associated with employee related expenses from the expansion of our international businesses  including the impact of the acquisition of godrej hershey foods and beverages company 
compared with selling  marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our business realignment initiatives 
reduced advertising expense in was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses

hershey trust company  as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school the milton hershey school trust or the trust maintains voting control over the hershey company 
historically  the milton hershey school trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy  nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board of directors or management 
however  in october  the chairman of the board of the milton hershey school trust issued a statement indicating that the trust continues to be guided by two key principles first  that  in its role as controlling stockholder of the company  it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and  second  that the long term prosperity of the company requires the board of directors of the company and its management to build on its strong us position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth 
he further stated that the milton hershey school trust had communicated to the company s board that the trust was not satisfied with the company s results and that  as a result  the trust was actively engaged in an ongoing process  the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous company board focus on resolving the company s current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies 
in that release  the trust board chairman reiterated the trust s longstanding position that the company board  and not the trust board  is solely responsible and accountable for the company s management and performance 

table of contents on november  we announced that all of the members of our board of directors had resigned except for richard h 
lenny  who was at that time our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david j 
west  who was at that time president of the company and currently serves as our president and chief executive officer  and robert f 
cavanaugh  who is also a member of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers governing body of milton hershey school 
in addition  we announced that the milton hershey school trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the by laws of the company to allow the company s stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our board of directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors  expanded the size of our board of directors from directors to directors  and appointed eight new directors  including two who are also members of the board of directors of hershey trust company and board of managers of milton hershey school 
the milton hershey school trust decided to explore a sale of the hershey company in june  but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in september after terminating the sale process  the trustee of the milton hershey school trust advised the pennsylvania office of attorney general in september that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in the hershey company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust following advance notice to the office of attorney general 
subsequently  pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the milton hershey school trust no longer having voting control of the company 
the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede  and petition the court having jurisdiction over the milton hershey school trust to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations 
this legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
in december  our board of directors unanimously adopted a stockholder protection rights agreement rights agreement 
the milton hershey school trust supported the rights agreement 
this action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the hershey company 
under the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right right for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends 
the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect  will not affect reported earnings per share  is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our common stock is traded

off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows payments due by year in thousands of dollars contractual obligations thereafter total unconditional purchase obligations non cancelable operating leases long term debt total obligations in entering into contractual obligations  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults 
purchase obligations we enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials 
these obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third party brokers and dealers 
these contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations 
total obligations for each year presented above  consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december  
table of contents the cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods 
we mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods 
increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts 
this applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of december  and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts 
taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities 
lease arrangement with special purpose trust in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation no 

interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special purpose entities spes  such as special purpose trusts spts  to which the usual condition for consolidation described in accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  does not apply because the spes have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests 
we adopted interpretation no 
as of june   resulting in the consolidation of off balance sheet arrangements with spts 
as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
in december  we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of a warehouse and distribution facility in redlands  california 
the lease term was approximately ten years  with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility 
the lease agreement contained an option for us to purchase the facility 
in january  we assigned our right to purchase the facility to an spt that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to us under a new lease agreement 
the term of this lease agreement was five years  with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor 
the cost incurred by the spt to acquire the facility  including land  was million 
we exercised our option to purchase the facility at the original cost of million and refinanced the related obligation at the end of the lease term in january asset retirement obligations our company has a number of facilities that contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations within these facilities 
our asbestos management program is compliant with current regulations 
current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished 
we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities 
we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and  therefore  sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos 
as of december   certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale 
we are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which has not been reflected in our current estimates 
income tax obligations we base our deferred income taxes  accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income  statutory tax rates  the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws 
we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
from time to time  these audits result in assessments of additional tax 
we maintain reserves for such assessments 
we adjust the reserves  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established 
assessments of additional tax require cash payments 
we are not aware of any significant income tax assessments 
the amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes 

table of contents accounting policies and market risks associated with derivative instruments we use certain derivative instruments  from time to time  including interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options  and commodities futures contracts  to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures 
these derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
we enter into commodities futures contracts for varying periods 
these futures contracts are intended to be  and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases  energy requirements and transportation costs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features 
in entering into these contracts  we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
we do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults 
accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income 
we reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  if any  must be recognized currently in earnings 
fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet 
for fair value hedges  we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item 
the effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value 
as of december   we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts  as cash flow hedges 
additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of december  note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information 
long term debt the table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long term debt  including the current portion  as of december  we determined the fair value of long term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues 
maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands of dollars except for rates long term debt interest rate we calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of december  
table of contents interest rate swaps in order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure  from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in december  we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to million of term financing to be executed during in february  we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge 
in august  a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of million of year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of million 
the million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the million of notes due september  in october  we entered into swap agreements effectively converting interest payments on long term debt from fixed to variable rates 
we converted interest payments on million of notes due in october and million of notes due in march from their respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the london interbank offered rate  libor 
in march  we terminated these agreements  resulting in cash receipts totaling million  with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long term debt 
we amortized this increase over the terms of the respective long term debt as a reduction to interest expense 
as of december   and we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 
foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment  raw materials and finished goods 
we also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the united states 
these contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements 
we generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from to months 
foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable  foreign currency commitments 
we designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives 
the fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
a summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows december  contract amount primary currencies contract amount primary currencies in millions of dollars foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies british pounds australian dollars euros australian dollars canadian dollars euros foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies canadian dollars brazilian reais mexican pesos 
table of contents we define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period 
we estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms  adjusted where necessary for maturity differences 
a summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows december  in millions of dollars fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options liability asset potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near term adverse change in market rates our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates 
commodities price risk management and futures contracts our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa beans  cocoa products  sugar  dairy products  peanuts and almonds 
the cost of cocoa beans and cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors 
these factors include the effect of weather on crop yield  imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries  and speculative influences 
during  cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between and per pound  based on the new york board of trade futures contract 
our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices  premiums and discounts that reflect varying delivery times  and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans  cocoa liquor  cocoa butter and cocoa powder 
during  dairy prices were significantly higher  starting the year at nearly per pound and rising to per pound on a class ii fluid milk basis 
tight global supplies were driven by drought in australia as well as reduced exports from the european union due to the elimination of subsidies 
also  input costs for us producers were up due to heightened grain prices impacting feed costs 
additionally  the united states department of agriculture adjusted their mechanism for establishing market prices of nonfat dry milk  further escalating costs 
we attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of our raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for to months 
we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa beans and cocoa products  sugar  corn sweeteners  natural gas  fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements 
however  the dairy markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and  therefore  it is not possible to hedge our costs by taking forward positions to extend coverage for longer periods of time 
we use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs 
our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs  but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases 

table of contents we account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with sfas no 
we make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the new york board of trade or various other exchanges 
these changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses 
we report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income 
the cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials  energy requirements and transportation costs 
futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases 
sensitivity analysis the following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent  based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year 
our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities 
inventories  priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations 
we define a loss  for purposes of determining market risk  as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement 
the fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices  including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period 
for the years ended december  fair value market risk hypothetical change fair value market risk hypothetical change in millions of dollars highest long position lowest long position average position long the decrease in fair values from to primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions  which more than offset the impact of higher prices in the negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years 
sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected 
factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield  imbalances between supply and demand  currency exchange rates  political unrest in producing countries  speculative influences  and changes in our hedging strategies 

table of contents use of estimates and other critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in various instances  gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following accounts receivable trade accrued liabilities pension and other post retirement benefit plans goodwill and other intangible assets commodities futures contracts management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable trade in the normal course of business  we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria 
our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with mclane company  inc  one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores  drug stores  wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers 
mclane company  inc accounted for approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  as of december   no other customer accounted for more than of our total accounts receivable 
we believe we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base 
accounts receivable trade  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  were net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectibility based on historical trends  and evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable  assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks 
estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future 
information on our accounts receivable trade  related expenses and assumptions is as follows for the three year period in millions of dollars  except percents average expense for potential uncollectible accounts average write offs of uncollectible accounts allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable we recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling  marketing and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents if we made reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectibility of accounts receivable  our annual provision could change within the following range a reduction in expense of approximately million  and an increase in expense of approximately million 
changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products 
liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs we recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition 
information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars promotional costs we determine the amount of the accrued liability by analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar  previously offered programs 
the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation  particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range a reduction in costs of approximately million an increase in costs of approximately million changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes 
over the three year period ended december   actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 
changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products at the time of sale  we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future 
the estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales 
a related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends  seasonal timing and sales patterns  and product movement at retail 

table of contents estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  changes in consumer demand  the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs 
over the three year period ended december   costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately of gross sales 
reasonably possible near term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from 
million to million 
over the three year period ended december   actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than 
reasonably possible near term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans overview we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans 
the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees 
these are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to january  we monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans  as well as recent court cases  for any impact on our plans 
we also sponsor two primary post retirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually  and the life insurance plan is non contributory 
we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of and federal income tax laws 
for years beginning after  we will need to comply with the funding requirements of the pension protection act of we fund non domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans 
we broadly diversify our pension plan assets  consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities 
short term and long term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations 
these calculations consider payroll and employee data  including age and years of service  along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements 
we take into consideration long term projections with regard to economic conditions  including interest rates  return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
with regard to liabilities associated with post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance  we take into consideration the long term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits 
in compliance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption asset return assumption for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when long term asset return projections demonstrate that need 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other post retirement benefit plan  such as a retiree health care plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 

table of contents recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position 
disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition asset or obligation 
we adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december  pension plans our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net periodic pension benefit income costs assumptions average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation asset return assumptions net periodic pension benefit costs we recorded net periodic pension benefit income in primarily due to the modifications announced in october which reduced future benefits under the hershey company retirement plan  the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees and the supplemental executive retirement plan  the higher actual return on pension assets during  and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of december  pension income is expected to increase somewhat in due to the impact of the business realignment initiatives and the retirement or departure of certain executives 
actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations 
we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains losses in excess of of a respective plan s projected benefit obligation  or the fair market value of assets  if greater 
the estimated recognized net actuarial gain component of net periodic pension benefit income for is 
million 
the recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit income was million 
projections beyond are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets 
average discount rate assumption net periodic benefit income costs the discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations 
in order to estimate this rate for and  a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation s cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the citigroup pension discount curve 
in  we considered the yields of high quality securities in determining the average discount rate assumptions 
high quality securities are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency 
the duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of our pension plan liabilities 

table of contents the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
average discount rate assumption benefit obligations the discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit income cost as described above 
we increased our discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment 
the use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  pension benefits obligations by million 
asset return assumptions we based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit income costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets 
the historical geometric average return over the years prior to december  was approximately 
the actual return on assets was as follows for the years ended december  actual return on assets the use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit income cost a one percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have decreased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
a one percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have increased net periodic pension benefit income by million 
our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class 
the ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows asset class allocation range equity securities debt securities cash and certain other investments as of december   actual allocations were within the specified ranges 
we expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes 
as of december   the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the lehman aggregate bond index and direct exposure to highly volatile  risky sectors  such as sub prime mortgages  was minimal 

table of contents for and  minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material 
however  we made contributions of million in and million in to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non qualified pension plans 
these contributions were fully tax deductible 
a one percentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans 
for  there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non domestic plans will not be material

a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the december  other post retirement benefits obligations by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill  the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired 
we use a two step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair 
table of contents value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record 
in the second step  we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets 
we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference 
the assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions 
our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets  patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions 
we amortize customer related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives 
the useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and  therefore  we do not amortize them 
we evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows 
the company performs annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
as a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting from lower expected profitability  we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly owned subsidiary  hershey do brasil  exceeded its fair value and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in december there was no tax benefit associated with this charge 
we discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of december  and based on our annual impairment evaluation 
commodities futures contracts we use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases  provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations 
accounting for commodities futures contracts is in accordance with sfas no 
additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in note  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows for the years ended december  in millions of dollars net after tax gains losses on cash flow hedging derivatives reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income hedge ineffectiveness losses gains recognized in cost of sales  before tax we reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in cost of sales 
no gains or losses on commodities futures contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur 

table of contents we recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment 
the amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts  expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately million after tax as of december  this amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts 
return measures we believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders equity and operating return on average invested capital 
these operating return measures calculated in accordance with gaap are presented on the six year consolidated financial summary on page with the directly comparable non gaap operating return measures 
the non gaap operating return measures are calculated using non gaap income excluding items affecting comparability 
a reconciliation of net income presented in accordance with gaap to non gaap income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages and  along with the reasons why we believe that the use of non gaap income in these calculations provides useful information to investors 
operating return on average stockholders equity operating return on average stockholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
to calculate non gaap operating return on average stockholders equity  we define non gaap income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items 
these items include the following after tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in    and adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the provision for income taxes in after tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in after tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our company in our operating return on average stockholders equity  gaap basis  was in our non gaap operating return on average stockholders equity was in the decrease in operating return on average stockholders equity in was principally due to lower income 
over the last six years  our non gaap operating return on stockholders equity has ranged from in to in operating return on average invested capital operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital 
average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of long term debt  deferred income taxes and stockholders equity 
for the calculation of operating return on average invested capital  gaap basis  earnings is defined as net income adjusted to add back the after tax effect of interest on long term debt 
for the calculation of the non gaap operating return measure  we define earnings as net income adjusted to add back the after tax effect of interest on long term debt excluding the following after tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in    and adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 
table of contents after tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in after tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our company in our operating return on average invested capital  gaap basis  was in our non gaap operating return on average invested capital was in over the last six years  our non gaap operating return on average invested capital has ranged from in and to in and outlook the outlook section contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
refer to risk factors beginning on page for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals 
the year ended december  was very difficult 
we experienced sharp increases in the cost of commodities  particularly costs for dairy products 
these cost increases totaled approximately million and reduced gross margin by approximately basis points 
we also experienced increased competitive activity and changing consumer trends toward premium and trade up product segments that affected our growth and profitability
