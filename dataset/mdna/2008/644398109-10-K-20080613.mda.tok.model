executive overview overview we are a leader in transactional television and the international distribution of independent and general motion picture entertainment 
our key customers are large cable and satellite operators in the united states 
our products are sold to these operators who then distribute them to retail customers via pay per view and video on demand technology 
we earn revenue through contractual percentage splits of the retail price 
our three principal businesses are reflected in the transactional tv formerly referred to as the pay tv segment  film production and direct to consumer formerly referred to as internet segment operating segments 
our most profitable business lines are the transactional tv and film production segments 
our direct to consumer segment has recently been operating at or near break even as we update and redesign our consumer websites in an effort to increase traffic and the conversion rate of this traffic to paying members 
our corporate administration segment includes costs that are not directly associated or allocated to the other operating segments 
the business models of each of our segments are summarized below 
transactional tv segment our transactional tv segment is focused on the distribution of its pay per view and video on demand service to msos and dbs providers 
we earn a percentage of revenue  or split  from our content for each pay per view  subscription  or video on demand transaction that is purchased on our customers platform 
revenue growth occurs as we launch our services to new cable msos or dbs providers  experience growth in the number of digital subscribers for systems where our services are currently distributed  when we launch additional services with existing cable and dbs providers  and when our proportional buy rates improve relative to our competitors 
revenue growth can also occur when operators increase retail prices 
alternatively  our revenue could decline if we experience lower buy rates  if the revenue splits we receive from our customers decline  if our customers reduce the retail price of our content or if additional competitive channels are added to our customers platforms 
the revenue we generate from the transactional tv segment was impacted during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year by the following items revenue from our pay per view service was substantially lower as a result of a decline in the revenue splits we receive under our amended agreement with the second largest dbs provider in the us revenue from our video on demand service increased during the current fiscal year primarily due to the improved performance of our content on the largest cable mso platforms in the united states 
we have also modified the content combinations we provide to our video on demand customers and we believe these changes have had a positive impact on our results 
we discontinued our c band service after it became unprofitable during the second half of fiscal year  which resulted in a decline in the transactional tv revenue 
during fiscal year  we executed a key strategic arrangement with penthouse 
we expect that this relationship will contribute to the transactional tv segment s results in future periods 
the agreement  which was executed in september  provides us with exclusive domestic distribution rights to penthouse content for a term of years 
additionally  we received the exclusive right to distribute content domestically through penthouse branded video on demand and pay per view services 
when considering the future operating results of the transactional tv segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact the segment s future operating results increased competition from established adult entertainment companies or new entrants to the category  increased pressure from customers to reduce the revenue splits we receive or execute minimum guarantees  a decline in buyers of adult tv services due to a migration to other adult services such as the internet and iptv  slowing growth of the overall adult entertainment category and limited incremental distribution opportunities within the us  continued product commoditization  and adverse impacts to our business from a decline in discretionary customer spending as a result of less favorable us economic conditions 
the impact of these challenges and risks  and others that we may not have identified  could have a material adverse impact on our business 
nevertheless  we believe that we are well positioned to mitigate the impact of these risks and overcome the challenges 
during fiscal year and future periods  we believe that the transactional tv segment will continue to have opportunities for growth 
we currently expect future growth in the segment to occur if we are successful with the following objectives expanding international distribution opportunities in latin america and europe  increasing the proportional video on demand hours we receive on cable platforms  increasing market share through penthouse branded services  continuing to increase the number of digital customers able to view our pay per view and video on demand content as cable operators continue to transition analog customers to their digital platforms  transitioning by cable mso and dbs providers to less edited content standards  and improving the video on demand user interfaces 
film production segment we acquired the film production segment during fiscal year the film production segment has historically derived the majority of its revenue from two principal businesses the production and distribution of original motion pictures such as erotic thrillers  horror movies  and erotic  event styled content owned content  and the licensing of domestic third party films in international and domestic markets where we act as a sales agent for the product repped content 
this segment also periodically provides contract film production services to certain major hollywood studios producer for hire arrangements 
we generate revenue by licensing our owned content for a one time fee to premium tv services and through domestic and international distributors 
additionally  we license our erotic thrillers and adult event content to cable mso and dbs providers through revenue split arrangements that are structured in a similar manner to our transactional tv segment agreements 
the revenue splits we receive from cable mso and dbs providers for the film production segment content is higher than the revenue split we receive for our transactional tv segment content primarily due to the more mainstream nature of the content 
we also generate revenue through sales agency arrangements whereby we earn a sales commission and market fees by selling mainstream titles on behalf of film producers 
the film production segment has several well established relationships with certain independent mainstream filmmakers and licenses the rights to these filmmakers movies under the lightning entertainment group labels 
we have also recently established a new customer relationship and through this relationship  we expect to distribute repped content to domestic retail dvd markets 
through the arrangement  we will provide repped content to the customer under the lightning entertainment group label 
this customer will then market the film by placing it in limited theatrical release in order to increase the subsequent revenue generated in the larger retail dvd marketplace 
the us market for sales and rentals of dvd s is estimated to be over billion  and the dvd market has historically not been a focus of the film production segment 
we expect this new relationship will begin contributing incremental retail dvd revenue towards the end of fiscal year and will contribute more meaningful revenue beginning in fiscal year our film production segment also infrequently acts as a producer for hire for major hollywood studios 
through these arrangements  we provide services and incur costs associated with the film production 
once the film has been delivered and accepted by the customer  we earn a fee for our services 
although we maintain no ownership rights for the produced content  we are responsible for the management and oversight of the production 
during the current fiscal year  we completed and recognized revenue and cost of sales for such an arrangement 
we plan to continue to pursue opportunities to act as a producer for hire 
during fiscal year  we gained additional vod distribution for our event and erotic thriller content on several top ten cable msos and dbs provider platforms in the us at march   the film production segment owned content was distributed to over million homes 
when considering the future operating results of the film production segment  we believe the following challenges and risks could adversely impact this segment s operating results the identification and execution of owned content deals with premium movie service providers could become less frequent  we are making larger producer advances and incurring more significant costs for repped content films with larger production budgets and we may be unable to recover these advances and costs through the future sale of the films  increased competition to our owned content from more explicit adult film offerings  a decline in buyers of our owned content due to a migration to other adult services such as the internet  and adverse impacts to our business from a decline in discretionary customer spending as a result of less favorable us economic conditions 
if these challenges occur and we are unable to successfully address these issues  the results could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we believe that our awareness of the challenges provides us with the ability to proactively react to the circumstances if they occur 
during fiscal year and in future periods  we will focus on improving the revenue we generate from this segment through the following strategic initiatives improving the buy rates of vod owned content on cable mso and dbs platforms through the same methods utilized by our transactional tv segment  continuing the development of unique  original programming franchises  increasing investments in higher quality titles that we represent through our lightning entertainment group label  and refining our relationships with key repped content customers to increase our dvd market share 
direct to consumer segment our direct to consumer segment generates revenue primarily by selling monthly memberships to our consumer websites 
during fiscal year  we experienced a decline in the direct to consumer segment revenue 
we focused our efforts during the year on improving all aspects of our internet product in terms of site design  navigation  features  content and performance in an effort to increase traffic to the website and the conversion of that traffic into paying members 
additionally  we plan to launch a new version of our primary consumer website during fiscal year that will provide potential customers with new functionality and the opportunity to participate in a virtual website community 
because our efforts during fiscal year were primarily focused on the website redesign rather than marketing efforts  we experienced a decline in this segment s revenue 
as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we are no longer experiencing sequential quarterly declines in revenue and we expect to experience improvements in the revenue we generate from our consumer websites during fiscal year our direct to consumer segment acquired certain intellectual property rights to an iptv set top box during january this technology allows us to manufacture a device through which consumers can obtain content directly through the internet and view the content on television 
based on a test business model  we would provide consumers with a menu of various channels for a subscriber fee and consumers will also have the opportunity to subscribe to individual channel services or a packaged service 
we have incurred costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year associated with this test model and we expect to continue to incur costs as we develop this test business model 
if we are unsuccessful with the business model  there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
corporate administration segment the corporate administration segment reflects all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  that are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer operating segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs  and the sec  investor relations and printing costs associated with our public filings and shareholder communications 
our focus for this operating segment is balancing cost containment with the need for administrative support for the growth of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continuously evaluate our methods  estimates and judgments 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and considerations used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the recognition of revenue  the recognition and measurement of income tax expenses  assets and liabilities including the measurement of uncertain tax positions  the valuation and recognition of share based compensation  the valuation of recoupable costs including producer advances  direct costs and chargebacks  the achievement of certain earn out targets associated with our acquisition of mrg  the assessment of film costs and the forecast of anticipated revenue ultimate revenue  which is used to amortize film costs  the assessment of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets  and the reporting of prepaid distribution rights 
each of these critical accounting policies is described in detail below 
revenue recognition our revenue consists primarily of fees earned through the electronic distribution of our licensed and owned content through various media outlets including msos  dbs providers  the hospitality industry  the internet and wireless platforms  premium movie services  and other available media channels 
revenue also consists of fees earned through the licensing of third party content whereby we act as a sales agent for the film producer 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been rendered or delivery conditions for the completed film have been satisfied  the license period related to film production segment arrangements has begun and the customer can begin exploitation of the content  the fee is fixed or determinable and its collection is probable 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgment including estimating monthly revenue based on historical data and determining collectability of fees 
transactional tv segment pay per view and vod services the transactional tv segment s pay per view and video on demand revenue are recognized based on pay per view or video on demand buys and monthly subscriber counts reported each month by cable affiliates  dbs affiliates and hospitality providers 
the actual monthly sales information is not typically reported to the transactional tv segment until approximately days after the month of service 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the transactional tv segment s historical experience with each affiliated system 
revenue may be subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt of the monthly sales reports 
the impact from adjusting estimated revenue to actual revenue has historically been immaterial 
transactional tv segment advertising revenue from the advertising of products on our pay per view networks is recognized in the same month that the related advertised product is sold  as reported by our third party partners 
revenue from spot advertising is recognized in the month the spot is run on the transactional tv segment s networks 
transactional tv segment c band services c band network services were sold through customer subscriptions that ranged from a one month period to a three month period 
revenue associated with these services was recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
film production segment owned content licensing revenue from the licensing of films is recognized consistent with the provisions of statement of position sop accordingly  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery conditions of the completed film have been satisfied  the license period of the arrangement has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fees is probable 
for agreements that involve the distribution of content to the home video market  pay per view market and video on demand market  we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the fees earned from third party providers in advance of receiving the reported earnings from the third party providers because the market acceptance varies unpredictably by film 
as a result  our share of licensing revenue from these arrangements is not recognized until the amounts are reported by third party providers 
film production segment repped content licensing in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 we recognize revenue from represented film licensing activities on a net basis as an agent 
the revenue recognized for these transactions represents only the sales agency fee earned by us on the total licensing fee 
the producers share of the licensing fee is recorded as a liability by us until the balance is remitted to the producer 
the agreements entered into with the producers may also provide for a marketing fee that can be earned by us 
the marketing fee is stated as a fixed amount and is earned as collections from film licensing fees are received 
we recognize marketing fees as revenue when the amounts become determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
the revenue recognition of the marketing fee generally corresponds to the performance of the related marketing activities 
direct to consumer segment internet membership fees revenue from internet membership fees is recognized over the life of the membership 
we record an allowance for refunds based on expected membership cancellations  credits and chargebacks 
income tax expenses  assets and liabilities we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision expense 
these estimates and judgments are used in the determination of tax credits  benefits and deductions  and the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which are a result of differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also use estimates and judgments in determining interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates could result in a material change to our tax provision in subsequent periods 
we are required to evaluate the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if our evaluation determines that the recovery is unlikely  we are required to increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets equal to the amount that is not expected to be recoverable 
we currently estimate that these deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if our estimates were to change and our assessment indicated we would be unable to recover the deferred tax assets  we would be required to increase our income tax provision expense in the period of our change in estimate 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of tax regulations 
effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position liabilities accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this process is based on various factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new audit activity 
changes to these factors and our estimates regarding these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
share based compensation effective april   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
sfas no 
r requires employee and non employee director stock options to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value 
accordingly  share based compensation is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award 
we previously accounted for awards granted under our stock incentive plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and provided the required pro forma disclosures prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
the exercise price of options granted was equal to or greater than the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  no share based compensation was recognized in the financial statements prior to april  under the modified prospective method of adoption for sfas no 
r  the compensation cost recognized beginning in april includes a compensation cost for all equity incentive awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all equity incentive awards granted subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we use the straight line attribution method to recognize share based compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award 
we have various stock plans for key employees and non employee directors which were stockholder approved and under which nonqualified and incentive stock options have been granted as noted above 
options granted generally vest over a one to four year period and expire ten years from the grant date  and we issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of these stock options 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that cash flows from the exercise of stock options resulting from tax benefits in excess of recognized cumulative compensation cost excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows 
for share based compensation recognized during the fiscal year ended march  and as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r as well as pro forma disclosures according to the original provisions of sfas no 
for the periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted 
volatility assumptions were derived using historical volatility data 
the expected term data was stratified between officers and non officers 
the expected term was determined using the weighted average exercise behavior for these two groups of employees 
during the quarter ended march   our future dividend yield at the time the options were issued was to be determined as of free cash flow and so the dividend yield assumption used for stock options issued during that period was based on a forecast estimate of our future free cash flow determined at the approximate date that the related stock options were issued 
the dividend yield assumption for stock options issued during the fiscal year ended march  was based on the declared dividend as approved by the board of directors divided by our end of day stock price on the related date of the stock option grant 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended march  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and are different for officers and non officers 
in pro forma information required under sfas no 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
recoupable costs and producer advances recoupable costs and producer advances represent amounts paid by us that are expected to be subsequently recouped through the collection of fees associated with the licensing of repped content 
in connection with the film production segment s repped content operations  we enter into sales agency agreements whereby we act as a sales agent for a producer s film 
these arrangements typically include provisions whereby certain costs that are incurred for marketing will be paid by us on behalf of the producer such as movie trailer and ad material costs 
we may also pay the producer a nonrefundable advance for the related film prior to the distribution of such film 
as we subsequently license the producer s film and license fees are collected  the recoupable costs and producer advances are recouped by us through these license fee collections 
license fees are typically not paid to the producer of the related film until such recoupable costs and producer advances have been fully recovered 
we evaluate recoupable costs and producer advances for impairment based on estimates of future license fee collections 
an impairment of these assets could occur if we were unable to collect fees from the licensing of a film that was sufficient to recover the related outstanding recoupable costs and producer advances 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred impairment charges related to recoupable costs and producer advances of million 
no material impairment charges were incurred during the fiscal years ended march  or mrg earn out as part of the mrg acquisition  we entered into an earn out arrangement which provides for three additional earn out payments totaling million payable to the selling shareholders of mrg over a three year term if certain performance targets as defined by the purchase agreement are achieved each year 
the calendar year earn out target was exceeded and the amount due to the former principals of mrg of approximately million was paid in may in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent consideration paid to the shareholders of an acquired enterprise in a purchase business combination  the earn out amount was recorded as an expense because the future earn out consideration would be forfeited if the selling shareholders employment terminated 
during the first nine months of calendar year  we estimated that the second annual earn out target for the twelve months ended december  would also be met 
however  actual results for mrg were not sufficient to achieve the second annual performance target 
as a result  the previously accrued earn out liability of approximately million was reversed 
the second annual earn out payment could still be obtained by the selling shareholders of mrg if the performance results in year three of the earn out period exceed the related year three target by an amount greater than the year two target shortfall 
if actual performance or estimates for the twelve month period ending december  indicate that an overachievement equal to the shortfall in is likely to occur  we may be required to record the earn out expenses that were reversed in the third quarter of the current fiscal year in subsequent future periods 
we do not believe that the year three earn out or recoupment of the year two earn out is probable based on current estimates and historical performance data 
as a result  we have not accrued any earn out amounts at march  film costs and ultimate revenue we capitalize film costs in accordance with sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films 
film costs include costs to develop and produce films  which primarily consist of salaries  equipment and overhead costs 
film costs include amounts for completed films and films still in development 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of the films 
interest expense associated with film costs is not capitalized because the duration of productions is short term in nature 
the cost of film libraries acquired is also included as a component of film costs 
films are typically direct to television in nature 
film costs are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
film cost valuations are reviewed on a title by title basis when an event or circumstance indicates that the fair value of the title is less than the unamortized cost 
adjustments associated with film cost valuations could have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded an impairment expense of million for two film events whose fair value was less than the unamortized cost of the events 
we had no similar write offs during the years ended march  or capitalized film costs are recognized as an expense within cost of sales using the film forecast method 
under this method  capitalized film costs are expensed based on the proportion of the film s revenue recognized for such period relative to the film s estimated remaining ultimate revenue  not to exceed ten years 
ultimate revenue is the estimated total revenue expected to be recognized over a film s useful life 
film revenue associated with this method includes amounts from all sources on an individual film forecast computation method  as defined by sop estimates of ultimate revenue are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate  and amortization is also adjusted on a prospective basis for such a change in estimate 
changes in estimated ultimate revenue could be due to a variety of factors  including the proportional buy rates of the content as compared to competitive content as well as the level of market acceptance of television product 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an impairment analysis on goodwill at the reporting segment level annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting segment with its book value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the book value  then an impairment is deemed to have occurred 
we reviewed our recorded goodwill for potential impairment at march  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
we continually review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets  we consider the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeds the expected future cash flows 
the impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying value 
during the years ended march  and  we recorded impairment expenses of approximately million and million  respectively 
no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended march  prepaid distribution rights our transactional tv and direct to consumer segments film and content libraries consist of film licensing agreements 
we account for the licenses in accordance with sfas no 
 financial accounting by broadcasters 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we capitalize the costs associated with the licenses as well as certain editing costs and amortize these capitalized costs on a straight line basis over the term of the licensing agreement generally years 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 costs associated with such license agreements should be amortized using a basis that is consistent with the manner in which the related film revenue is expected to be recognized 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we amortize these costs on a straight line basis because each usage of the film is expected to generate similar revenue and the revenue for the films is expected to be recognized ratably over the related license term 
we regularly review and evaluate the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis as opposed to an alternative method of amortization such as an accelerated basis 
based on these analyses  we have determined that the amortization of the film library costs using a straight line basis most accurately reflects the manner in which the revenue for the related films will be recognized 
management periodically reviews the film and content libraries and assesses whether the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the libraries 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film libraries  we would expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value to the fair market value 
during the fiscal year ended march   we expensed million of unamortized costs associated with the direct to consumer segment s licensed content library 
during a periodic review of the film library and in connection with efforts to increase the quality of the products provided by this segment  we determined that certain identified content did not meet the quality standards necessary for future distribution 
as a result  we determined that the identified content had no future value and accordingly  we recorded an impairment expense to write off the remaining unamortized costs for this content 
we had no write offs of prepaid distribution rights during the fiscal year ended march  or results of operations transactional tv segment the following table sets forth certain financial information for the transactional tv segment for each of the three fiscal years presented in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs net revenue ppv cable dbs vod c band and other revenue total cost of sales gross profit gross profit operating expenses operating income net revenue from advertising has been reclassified from ppv cable dbs to c band and other revenue to conform with the current year presentation 
additionally  certain executive operating expenses have been reclassified from the transactional tv segment to the corporate administration segment to conform with the current year presentation 
net revenue ppv cable dbs ppv cable dbs revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to as a result of lower revenue from the second largest dbs provider in the us following the renegotiation of our contract with that customer in the third quarter of fiscal year we receive a lower revenue split under the terms of the new contract 
concurrent with the renegotiation of this contract  two additional competitive channels were added to the same customer platform which also resulted in a decline in revenue 
revenue from the largest dbs platform in the us was flat in fiscal year as compared to although we added an additional channel to that platform during the third quarter of fiscal year  the increase in revenue from the additional channel was offset by a reduction in the per channel revenue we receive on the platform 
our per channel revenue has declined primarily because competitive adult channels have been added to the platform 
furthermore  while we negotiated an automatic one year extension for each channel on this dbs platform that exceeded certain revenue targets through october  our current projections indicate that such revenue targets may not be reached and the one year extension may not be realized 
we may  therefore  be obligated to renegotiate the terms of that agreement  which may result in less favorable terms after october or the carriage of fewer channels 
growth in our ppv cable dbs revenue from fiscal year to was primarily the result of the initial launch of two channels on the largest dbs platform in the us in april this growth was partially offset by the above mentioned renegotiation of our contract with the second largest dbs provider in the us and the concurrent addition of two new competitive channels to that same platform 
vod vod revenue within the transactional tv segment increased during fiscal year as compared to as a result of an improvement in the performance of our content on the largest us cable mso 
revenue from our vod services was also higher as a result of increased buy rates for our content on the second largest cable mso platform in the us and other top ten cable mso platforms in the us the increase in vod revenue during fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to a a significant increase in revenue from the largest cable mso in the us  b improved performance from the second largest cable mso in the us  and c higher revenue from new launches on a top ten cable mso in the us partially offsetting these increases in revenue was the impact from the sale of adelphia communications corporation to larger multi channel operators from which we receive a lower license fee and from a decline in revenue from vod platforms where competitive content was added throughout the fiscal year 
c band and other revenue c band and other revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to due to customer conversions from c band big dish analog satellite systems to smaller digital dbs satellite systems  and from our discontinuation of the c band service during the third quarter of fiscal year the continued deterioration in subscribers made this service unprofitable and as a result  we discontinued the c band services in fiscal year we did not incur any material costs associated with discontinuing these services 
we also experienced a decline in c band revenue in fiscal year as compared to from the above mentioned deterioration in subscribers 
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of expenses associated with our digital broadcast center  satellite uplinking  satellite transponder leases  programming acquisitions  video on demand transport  and amortization of content licenses 
these costs also included in house call center operations related to the c band service prior to the discontinuation of that service 
cost of sales was lower during fiscal year as compared to due the cancellation of the transponder service used to distribute our plz network formerly known as pleasure and from the discontinuation of our c band service 
the decline in costs was partially offset by an increase in the video on demand transport fees we pay to a transport provider related to the execution of an amended contract with that provider in early fiscal year the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal year as compared to was due to a a decline in our transponder rates and the cancellation of a transponder lease for our plz network  b lower transport fees through the use of new transport provider  c a general decline in our content amortization costs  d lower c band call center expenses from a strategic reduction in costs associated with the service  and e lower depreciation and equipment lease costs because certain equipment and leases reached the end of their estimated useful lives 
partially offsetting these declines in costs was an increase in expenses for additional broadcast and media employees 
we hired these new employees to process the incremental increase in content 
operating expenses and operating income the increase in operating expenses during fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to a an increase in costs associated with promotion and marketing activities for new channel launches  b a million loss for the early disposition of equipment used within our digital broadcast center  c the impact from writing off million in tenant improvements associated with a prospective facility that proved inadequate for our requirements  and d an increase in costs related to improving the segment s it infrastructure 
the increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in certain prior year advertising costs that were incurred in an effort to improve buy rates on distribution platforms 
operating income for fiscal year was million as compared to million during fiscal year the increase in our operating expenses in fiscal year as compared to is primarily related to a additional stock option expenses related to the adoption of sfas no

information regarding the variance in the fiscal year results as compared to is not provided in the below discussion because the film production segment was acquired in february and the information is not considered useful 
net revenue owned content the decrease in owned content revenue during fiscal year as compared to is primarily due to a decline in the number of large customer agreements that were executed during fiscal year we also received less revenue during fiscal year from a large pay per view aggregator and from the largest dbs platform in the us due to an unfavorable change in the license fee structure with that customer and from a change in the placement of our content on that platform s electronic platform guide 
these declines in revenue were partially offset by an increase in vod revenue from our distribution of content on six major us cable msos 
repped content repped content revenue includes revenue from the licensing of film titles that we represent but do not own under international sales agency relationships with various independent film producers 
the revenue from our repped content was flat during fiscal year as compared to other revenue other revenue relates to amounts earned through producer for hire arrangements  music royalty fees and the delivery of other miscellaneous film materials to distributors 
the increase in other revenue during fiscal year as compared to is due to our completion of a producer for hire arrangement with a major hollywood studio during the current fiscal year 
cost of sales our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the amortization of our owned content film costs as well as delivery and distribution costs related to that content 
these expenses also include the costs we incur to provide producer for hire services 
there is no significant cost of sales related to the repped content services 
the decline in cost of sales during fiscal year is primarily related lower film cost amortization associated with the decline in owned content revenue 
cost of sales also declined as a result of the monetization of films that were produced after the acquisition of this segment in films that were produced prior to the mrg acquisition typically have a higher cost of sales because they were recorded at fair value when we acquired mrg 
also contributing to the decline in cost of sales was the delivery of older titles whose film costs had been fully amortized in prior periods 
film cost amortization as a percentage of the related owned content revenue for fiscal year and was and  respectively 
the decrease in costs was partially offset by an increase in cost of sales from expenses realized in connection with the completion of a producer for hire arrangement 
operating expenses and operating income operating expenses increased in fiscal year primarily as a result of a million impairment charge incurred for two film events 
the film costs for the events were initially established at the time of our acquisition of mrg in and were recorded at fair value based on the expected future benefits to be derived from the events 
we lowered our estimate of the expected future benefits to be derived from these events during fiscal year and as a result  we recorded an impairment charge for the events equal to the difference in the remaining unamortized event costs and the expected future benefits to be derived 
operating expenses were also higher during fiscal year due to a a million reserve expense recorded for potentially unrecoupable costs incurred on older repped content titles  b a million bad debt write off related to an uncollectible customer account  and c an increase in trade show exhibition costs 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a reduction in the mrg earn out expense 
the mrg purchase agreement provides that if certain annual performance targets are achieved by mrg in each of the twelve month performance periods ending december   and  the former principals of mrg could receive additional earn out payments of approximately million in each of the periods 
during our fiscal year ended march   we recorded an earn out expense of approximately million associated with mrg s achievement of the performance target during the performance period 
during the performance period  actual results for mrg were not sufficient to achieve the performance target and as a result  no earn out expense was recorded 
although the principals of mrg are entitled to recover the earn out for if actual results for the performance period exceed the performance target by the amount of the shortfall in  we do not currently estimate that this will occur based on historical and forecast performance data 
additionally  we do not expect that the earn out target will be achieved for the performance period and so we have not recorded any expense for that period 
if changes in our estimates indicate that an overachievement of the performance target equal to the shortfall in is likely to occur or that the performance period target will be achieved  we would accrue the related expenses in future periods 
operating income in each of the fiscal years ended march  and was million

net revenue net membership net membership revenue declined during fiscal year as compared to as a result of a decline in new memberships 
throughout fiscal year  we dedicated our resources in this segment towards rebuilding our consumer websites and as a result  our marketing efforts have not been as robust 
we expect to launch a new version of our primary consumer website during fiscal year that will provide potential customers with new functionality and the opportunity to participate in a virtual website community 
the decline in net membership revenue from fiscal year to was the result of a decline in traffic to our web site and erosion in monthly memberships 
during fiscal year  we experienced a decline in revenue because we did not actively market our websites and we participated in very few affiliate webmaster programs 
other revenue other revenue primarily relates to the sale of content to other webmasters  the distribution of our website to the lodgenet entertainment corporation customer base  and revenue from the distribution of our content through wireless platforms 
other revenue was flat during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year other revenue increased in fiscal year as compared to due to the sale of our content through wireless platforms 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the revenue we generate through the sale of content to third party webmasters 
cost of sales cost of sales primarily consists of expenses associated with credit card processing  bandwidth  traffic acquisition  content and depreciation of assets 
the direct to consumer segment s cost of sales declined during fiscal year as a result of lower amortization expense associated with the write off of a licensed content library during the third quarter of fiscal year also contributing to the decline was a reduction in wireless distribution expenses because we are no longer devoting resources to wireless activities 
cost of sales was flat during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year although costs declined from lower credit card processing costs related to the decline in our membership revenue as well as lower traffic acquisition costs and depreciation expense  the decrease in these costs was offset by higher costs associated with the distribution of our content on wireless platforms  including content costs  short message service sms fees  and software costs 
operating expenses and operating income operating expenses have declined during fiscal year as compared to from a reduction in employee costs related to wireless activities 
operating expenses were also lower because fiscal year amounts included a million licensed content impairment expense and a million asset impairment expense for certain distribution software 
these impairment charges did not recur in fiscal year the declines in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in costs from our efforts to update and improve our consumer websites and from additional employee costs associated with efforts to establish iptv services 
our operating income results for fiscal year were break even as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses in fiscal year as compared to is due to the above mentioned impairment charges incurred for licensed content and distribution software 
operating expenses were also higher as a result of increased costs related to the development and distribution of our content to wireless platforms and additional advertising costs to promote a sms campaign 
the increase in these costs was partially offset by a decline in costs related to our web product from certain employee terminations 
the direct to consumer segment generated an operating loss of million in fiscal year as compared to operating income of million in fiscal year corporate administration the following table sets forth certain financial information for the corporate administration segment for each of the three fiscal years presented in millions year ended march  percent change vs vs operating expenses certain executive operating expenses have been reclassified from the transactional tv segment to the corporate administration segment to conform with the current year presentation 
expenses related to the corporate administration segment include all costs associated with the operation of the public holding company  new frontier media  inc  which are not directly allocable to the transactional tv  film production  or direct to consumer segments 
these costs include  but are not limited to  legal and accounting expenses  human resources and training  insurance  registration and filing fees with nasdaq  executive employee costs and the sec  investor relations  and printing costs associated with our public filings and shareholder communications 
corporate administration costs increased during the fiscal year due to an increase in employee costs associated with a sales executive whose function is to sell products across all segments this employee s costs and services were previously associated with the wireless activities within the direct to consumer segment and an increase in costs associated with the hiring of a chief information officer in february these increases were partially offset by a decrease in external legal fees and bonus accruals 
the increase in costs during fiscal year as compared to is primarily related to a an increase in expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
r during the fiscal year which requires us to expense the fair value of stock options  b an increase in costs related to the addition of a chief operating officer and chief information officer  c an increase in outside legal costs  d an increase in outside accounting fees to ensure the film production segment was compliant with section of the sarbanes oxley act  e an increase in internal accounting resources necessary for increased compliance requirements  and f an increase in insurance costs related to additional key man life for the principals of the film production segment and higher director and officer insurance limits 
liquidity and capital resources our current priorities for the use of our cash are investments in processes intended to improve the quality and marketability of our products  funding the operations of the set top box and iptv business within our direct to consumer segment  funding our operating and capital requirements  and funding the repurchase from time to time of shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
we believe that existing cash and estimated cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements  and we believe that any capital expenditures  content licensing  film production costs  stock repurchases and inventory purchases that may be incurred can be financed through our current existing cash and investments and cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our cash flows from operating and investing activities for each of the three fiscal years presented are as follows in millions year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows from investing activities restricted funds held in escrow payment for business acquisitions  net of cash acquired purchase of investments available for sale redemption of investments available for sale purchase of equipment and furniture purchase of intangible assets payment of related party note arising from business acquisition net cash provided by used in investing activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year as compared to is primarily related to the following a million decrease in net income  a reduction in cash flows generated by the film production segment as reflected in the million decline in that segment s depreciation and amortization and the million increase in cash used for film production  and a million impact from cash paid for employee compensation 
cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in net income of million and additional cash flows associated with the first full year of operations of the film production segment 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in operating cash flows related to an additional million of cash disbursements for the purchase of prepaid distribution rights and million of additional cash disbursements associated with production costs in the film production segment 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily related to the net million of cash received from the redemption of investments 
this cash was primarily used to pay quarterly shareholder dividends and for the purchase of approximately  shares of common stock at an average price of per share through our stock repurchase program as reflected in the financing activities of the consolidated statements of cash flows discussed below 
capital expenditures of million primarily relate to purchases of servers and editing equipment to maintain our digital broadcast center and computers  and we paid million primarily related to our purchase of the intellectual property rights of a set top box for the provision of iptv services 
the related party note payable disbursements during each period presented were paid to the former principals of mrg from whom we acquired the film production segment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year cash disbursements in fiscal year primarily included capital expenditures for the purchase of editing equipment  computers  servers  software  encryption equipment for new cable launches  a storage area network system  and an archival storage system 
these cash disbursements were partially offset by cash receipts associated with the net redemption of million of investments 
cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal year primarily reflect cash disbursements associated with our acquisition of mrg 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities for each of the three fiscal years presented are as follows in millions year ended march  cash flows from financing activities payments on capital lease obligations purchase of common stock payments on line of credit proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises payment of dividend excess tax shortfall benefit from option warrant exercise decrease in other financing obligations net cash used in financing activities amounts may not sum due to rounding 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal year reflects million in payments for quarterly cash dividends and million for the purchase of common stock through our stock repurchase plan 
this use of cash was slightly offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the excess tax shortfall benefit relates to the tax deductions that we received upon exercise of an option by an employee or non employee director in excess of those anticipated at the time of the option grant 
net cash used during fiscal year primarily relates to the payment of a special dividend in the amount of per share  or million total  in february we also used million of cash to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock during the quarter ended september  at an average price of per share 
these cash disbursements were partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the year and a tax benefit of million related to tax deductions we received upon the exercise of options by employees and non employee directors 
during the fiscal year  we assumed certain debt and interest liabilities of approximately million as part of our acquisition of mrg 
concurrent with our acquisition of mrg  we paid the million balance of the debt and interest liabilities 
this use of cash was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year of million 
cash dividends and stock repurchase plan during each of the quarters in fiscal year  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
we paid approximately million in cash dividends through march  and we paid an additional million in april related to the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the board of directors did not declare a quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal year and suspended the company s quarterly dividend indefinitely 
the payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors 
in december  our board of directors approved a million share repurchase plan to be executed over months 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in accordance with this plan 
the total purchase price for these shares was approximately million and the average purchase price per share was 
in june the board of directors extended the duration of the stock repurchase program through june borrowing arrangements in july  we obtained a million line of credit from an outside financial institution 
amounts borrowed under the line of credit can be used to support our short term working capital needs 
the line of credit is secured by our trade accounts receivable and will mature in july the interest rate applied to borrowings under the line of credit is based on the current prime rate less 
the terms of the line of credit include certain defined negative and affirmative covenants customary for facilities of this type  and we were in compliance with these covenants at march  we have made no borrowings under the line of credit 
commitments and contingencies contractual cash obligations the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations as of march  for each of the fiscal year time periods specified payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligations vendor obligations employment contract obligations total totals may not sum due to rounding 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum services to be purchased and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations to acquire specified quantities of movie license rights that are subject to the delivery of the related movies are included in vendor obligations because we estimate that the movies will be delivered in the specified time periods 
we have recorded long term income taxes payable of million for uncertain tax positions  reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes 
we also have approximately million of uncertain tax positions recorded as current taxes payable at march  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments  if any  related to these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  the amounts have been excluded from the above table 
mrg earn out as part of the mrg acquisition  we entered into an earn out arrangement which provides for three additional earn out payments totaling million payable to the selling shareholders of mrg over a three year term if certain performance targets as defined by the purchase agreement are achieved each year 
the calendar year earn out target was exceeded and the amount due to the former principals of mrg of approximately million was paid in may during the calendar year earn out period  actual results for mrg were not sufficient to achieve the second annual performance target 
the second annual earn out payment could still be obtained by the selling shareholders of mrg if the performance results in year three of the earn out period exceed the related year three target by an amount greater than the year two target shortfall 
based on current estimates and actual historical performance data  we do not believe that the calendar earn out target will be achieved nor will the calendar year earn out be recovered 
if actual performance or estimates for the twelve month period ending december  indicate that the earn out targets are likely to be achieved  we could be required to record an earn out accrual for and uncertain tax positions in connection with our adoption of fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 we have million in total liabilities recorded for an unrecognized tax benefit at march  we estimate that it is reasonably possible that million of this balance will be settled during fiscal year and accordingly  this balance is classified as a current liability within taxes payable
