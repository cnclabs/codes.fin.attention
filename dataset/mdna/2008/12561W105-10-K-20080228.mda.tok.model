item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition regulatory matters retail rates of cleco power  and wholesale rates of cleco 
franchises cleco power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units  such as municipalities and parishes counties  and enforced by state regulation 
these franchises are for fixed terms  which may vary from years to years or more 
in the past  cleco power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each reached the end of its term 
cleco power s next municipal franchise expires in renewed franchises cleco power renewed the following franchise agreements during and date city term number of customers march covington years may mamou years may ville platte years may dequincy years september glenmora years november kinder years other franchise matters on february   the city council of eunice voted to accept a city wide franchise proposal with south louisiana electric membership cooperative slemco a local electric cooperative 
the cooperative will now have the opportunity to serve customers city wide 
however  both utilities are required to follow the lpsc foot rule regulation to determine which utility can provide electricity to the customer 
in general  if a utility s distribution system is within feet of the new customer s meter point  that utility automatically serves the customer 
otherwise  the customer may choose the electricity provider 
this decision does not have a material impact on cleco power s results of operations or financial condition  but could reduce future customer and load growth as both utilities compete for new customers 
in june  slemco entered into a limited franchise agreement with the city of crowley 
cleco power also provides electric service to crowley under an existing franchise agreement 
the new agreement allows slemco to compete for new customers in areas of the city that have been annexed by crowley since this decision does not have a material impact on cleco power s results of operations or financial condition  but could reduce customer and load growth as both utilities compete for new customers 
historically  cleco power has been allowed to recover municipal franchise fees as part of the base rates it charges retail customers 
consequently  franchise fees are recovered from customers both inside and outside a franchised area 
in october  the lpsc ordered the billing of franchise fees as a separate line item on customer bills 
the decision provided that of the franchise fee would continue to be included in base rates charged to retail customers and of the franchise fee would be included on customer bills as a separate line item  billed only to customers within the franchised area 
a number of parishes have attempted in recent years to impose franchise fees on retail revenue earned within the unincorporated areas cleco power serves 
if the parishes are ultimately successful  cleco power believes the new franchise tax paid to the parishes will be passed on to the affected customers and will not reduce cleco power s earnings

legislative and regulatory changes and matters various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of cleco corporation cleco power form k the electric utility industry 
such issues include  among others implementation of the energy policy act of  passage of the energy independence and security act of  regulation of previously deregulated retail electric markets  the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs  the role of electric utilities  independent power producers and competitive bidding in the purchase  construction and operation of new generating capacity  the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility s transmission system  ferc s assessment of market power and utilities ability to buy generation assets  mandatory transmission reliability standards  the authority of the ferc to grant utilities the power of eminent domain  increasing requirements for renewable energy sources  comprehensive multi emissions environmental legislation  and ferc s increased ability to impose financial penalties 
the registrants are unable  at this time  to predict the outcome of such issues or effects on their financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
for information on certain regulatory matters and regulatory accounting affecting cleco  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition regulatory matters 
environmental matters environmental quality cleco is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties 
cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations  and management believes cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits  as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
environmental requirements continue to increase as a result of new legislation  administrative actions  and judicial interpretations 
therefore  the future effects of existing and potential requirements are difficult to determine 
cleco power may request recovery from its retail customers of its costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco s capital expenditures related to environmental compliance were million during and are estimated to total million in the following table lists capital expenditures for environmental matters by subsidiary 
subsidiary thousands environmental capital expenditures for projected environmental capital expenditures for cleco power evangeline acadia total represents aph s portion of acadia the increase in projected environmental capital expenditures at cleco power from to primarily relates to the installation of new low nox burners at the rodemacher unit power station and enhancements to the so scrubber at the dolet hills power station 
the installation of the low nox burners at rodemacher unit is expected to be completed during  while the enhancements to the so scrubber at dolet hills are expected to be completed in the increase in projected capital expenditures at evangeline from to primarily relates to the installation of a system to remove aquatic vegetation in the lake which cools the circulating water from the generating units at the plant 
the installation of this system is expected to be completed during air quality the state of louisiana regulates air emissions from each of cleco s generating units through the air quality regulations of the ldeq 
in addition  the ldeq has been delegated authority over and implements certain programs established by the epa 
the ldeq establishes standards of performance and requires permits for certain generating units in louisiana 
all of cleco s generating units are subject to these requirements 
the federal clean air act established a regulatory program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on so 

emissions from certain generating units 
the federal clean air act requires these generating stations to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of so emitted beginning in the year the epa allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions 
as of december   cleco power and midstream had sufficient allowances for operations and expect to have sufficient allowances for operations 
the federal clean air act required the epa to revise nox emission limits for existing coal fired boilers 
in november  the epa finalized rules lowering the nox emission rate for certain boilers  which apply to rodemacher unit and dolet hills 
the rules also allowed an early elect option to achieve compliance with a less restrictive nox limit beginning no later than january  cleco power exercised this option in december early election protects cleco power from any further reductions in the nox permitted emission rate until when the limit is lowered by 
rodemacher unit and dolet hills have been in compliance with the nox early election limits since their inception and are expected to continue to be in compliance with the reduced limit in cleco power s phase i low nox burner project was permitted by the ldeq and installed in to achieve compliance with the reduced acid rain permit limits for nox at dolet hills 
rodemacher unit is anticipated to achieve compliance with cleco corporation cleco power form k these reduced acid rain nox limits in its current configuration 
with its low nox 

burner project completed  rodemacher unit is expected to achieve compliance by an even greater margin 
the additional nox reductions achieved by the low nox 

burner projects may qualify for early reduction credits under the federal clean air interstate rule cair 
significant future reductions in nox emissions limits may require other capital improvements at one or both of the units 
nox emissions from the evangeline and acadia generating units are within the units respective permitted limits  as these units use modern turbine and selective catalytic reduction technology that reduces nox emissions to minimal levels 
on march   cair was finalized by the epa 
cair covers the district of columbia and eastern states  including louisiana  and provides a federal framework requiring states to reduce emissions of so and so cair calls for so reductions to begin in the year and so reductions in the epa anticipates that the states will achieve this primarily by reducing emissions from the power generation sector 
louisiana promulgated state regulations to incorporate these requirements 
the ldeq has chosen to remain under the federal implementation plan fip for compliance with cair so provisions 
it has also proposed to follow the fip for the annual nox and ozone season nox trading programs with the exception of the nox allowance allocation methodology 
cleco is evaluating potential compliance strategies to meet the emission reductions contemplated by these regulations 
the installation of new low nox burners and enhancements to the nox scrubber at dolet hills are expected to be an integral part of meeting the cair nox and so reduction provisions 
likewise  the installation of new low nox burners planned for rodemacher unit in at a projected cost of million should also help meet cair requirements 
cleco s compliance strategy to meet the cair requirements may also include additional emission controls  purchase of allowances  or fuel changes 
on march   the epa issued final rules regarding mercury emissions from electric utility boilers 
the federal clean air mercury rule camr established standards of performance limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and created a market based cap and trade program 
camr emissions reductions were to take effect in january louisiana adopted epa s federal camr regulations by reference and incorporated these requirements in louisiana s state regulations 
cleco owns units that would have been subject to camr  namely dolet hills and rodemacher unit however  on february   the us court of appeals for the us circuit in new jersey v 
epa  vacated both the epa s rule delisting coal and oil fired electric generating units egu s from regulation under section of the clean air act caa and the entire camr rule 
as a result of the court s action  egus are subject to regulation under section  which will require the epa to promulgate maximum achievable control technology mact standards for hazardous air pollutants for coal and oil fired egus 
the new jersey decision will not go into effect until the court issues its mandate  which is unlikely to happen before march  the epa has a day window from the day a decision is handed down to petition the court for rehearing 
if the epa petitions for rehearing in the dc circuit or asks the supreme court to hear the case  the effectiveness of the dc circuit s decision could be delayed even further 
once new jersey becomes effective assuming there is not a reversal of the decision by the supreme court or the dc circuit itself  the epa will have to move forward to set mact standards for coal and oil fired egus under section of the caa which requires that new sources must adopt at minimum the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source  as determined by the administrator and existing sources must adopt emission controls equal to the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing percent of the existing source 
at this time  cleco anticipates that the epa would take at least two to three years to gather new data and promulgate an updated mact standard for egu s and another three years for the regulations to become effective 
this court decision could have an impact on state administered mercury programs as well 
state programs such as louisiana that incorporated the federal camr by reference  are likely to claim that their state rules are voided by this decision and take action to vacate the state s version of the rule 
congress continues to consider several bills related to climate change  which may include substantial  mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
the majority of the bills would require reductions in carbon dioxide from electric generating units 
on april   the supreme court ruled that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the federal clean air act 
as air pollutants  the supreme court s decision would require the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles if  in the epa s judgment  such greenhouse gas emissions may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare 
based on the supreme court s decision that greenhouse gases are air pollutants  the epa could decide to use its authority under the clean air act to regulate greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide  from stationary sources such as power plants 
thus  the supreme court ruling could possibly lead to the federal regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the upcoming years independent of any climate change bill being considered by congress 
cleco will continue to also monitor the development of other new legislative and regulatory requirements relating to climate change and their potential impacts 
as mandated by law  the ldeq developed and promulgated the comprehensive toxic air pollutant emission control regulation under title  chapter of the louisiana administrative code 
this rule requires that any major source of toxic air emissions  as defined by the ldeq  shall control emissions of toxic air pollutants to a degree that constitutes maximum achievable control technology mact 
mact is determined by the permitting authority  in this case the ldeq 
in addition to incorporating the control technology standards  the state rule establishes emission reporting requirements for all major sources of toxic air pollutants and sets an ambient air cleco corporation cleco power form k standard for each pollutant 
steam electric generating units traditionally have been exempt from this rule 
on december   the ldeq proposed rules removing the exemption from such units 
however  on december   the ldeq reinstated the exemption to utilities in a final action on the air toxics rule 
on june   the epa proposed to strengthen the national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ground level ozone  the primary component of smog 
the epa also requested comments on alternative levels of the primary ozone standard 
depending on the final level the epa chooses  a significant number of additional parishes of louisiana could be designated as non attainment  meaning they do not meet the national ambient air quality standards for that area 
since nox emissions are a precursor to ozone formation  existing fossil fuel fired units located in or near these ozone non attainment areas that do not currently utilize best available control technology could be targeted for installation of additional nox emission controls 
in february  cleco power received notices from the epa requesting information relating to the rodemacher and dolet hills power stations 
the apparent purpose of the investigation is to determine whether cleco power has complied with new source review and new source performance standards requirements under the clean air act in connection with capital expenditures  modifications  or operational changes made at these facilities 
cleco power has completed its response to the initial data request 
it is unknown at this time whether the epa will take further action as a result of the information provided by cleco power 
the enactment of federal or state renewable portfolio standards rps mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources  such as wind  solar  biomass and geothermal  could result in certain changes in cleco s business or its competitive position 
these changes could include renewable energy credit costs and capital expenditures for renewable generation resources 
rps legislation has been enacted in many states 
states such as louisiana that do not have rps requirements could adopt such requirements in the future 
cleco is evaluating the impacts of potential rps legislation on its businesses based on the rps programs in other states 
cleco will continue to monitor developments related to rps at the federal and state levels 
water quality cleco has received from the epa and ldeq permits required under the federal clean water act for waste water discharges from its five generating stations 
waste water discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration  and cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods 
the ldeq issued a louisiana pollutant discharge elimination system waste water permit renewal for evangeline power station on june  this waste water permit contains certain additional copper and total dissolved solids tds permit limitations that cleco contends are beyond the legal authority of ldeq to include in the waste water permit 
cleco challenged these permit provisions by filing a de novo review judicial appeal on september   in district court in east baton rouge parish  louisiana 
while litigation has been filed  cleco actively is engaged with ldeq in settlement discussions regarding the appealed provisions of the waste water permit  and cleco believes that an amicable resolution will be reached with the agency 
while the filed litigation is pending  the appealed copper and tds permit limitations are stayed and do not take effect 
the uncontested portions of the evangeline waste water permit were effective january  section b of the clean water act regulates potential adverse environmental impacts to all aquatic species due to water intake structures 
these regulations establish requirements applicable to the location  design  construction  and capacity of cooling water intake structures 
section b is applicable to cleco s teche power station and evangeline power station 
on july   the epa officially suspended the phase ii  b rule as a result of a january decision by the us court of appeals for the second circuit which largely overturned the epa s final phase ii b rule 
the appeals court decision limits or rejects the use of cost effectiveness and cost benefit tests historically recognized by other federal courts 
due to the suspension of the rule  mandatory compliance dates for the completion of studies and assessments will likely be delayed for some time 
until the epa promulgates a replacement phase ii rule  the epa has indicated that it will ask permit writers to use best professional judgement in evaluating permit renewals until a new b rule is promulgated 
unless the second circuit s decision is overturned by the supreme court  the epa and the ldeq could mandate that the next generation of permit renewals  which for applicable cleco facilities will occur in the timeframe  include a more expensive  technology based approach ie modifications to existing intake structures or conversion to cooling tower systems 
at this time  it is uncertain which technology option  if any  will be required to be installed on cleco s intake structures and the associated costs of those modifications 
cleco anticipates that any new requirements for its affected facilities would be established as the facilities go through the water discharge permit renewal process 
solid waste disposal the solid waste division of the ldeq has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations 
cleco has received all required permits from the ldeq for the on site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations 
cleco is in the process of renewing the solid waste permits for the rodemacher and dolet hills solid waste units and upgrading them according to the current solid waste regulations 
these upgrades are not expected to result in substantial costs 
hazardous waste generation cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its five generating stations and at other locations 
cleco does not treat  store long term  or dispose of these wastes on site  therefore  no permits are required 
all hazardous wastes produced by cleco are disposed of at federally permitted hazardous waste disposal sites 
cleco corporation cleco power form k toxic substances control act tsca the tsca directs the epa to regulate the marketing  disposal  manufacturing  processing  distribution in commerce  and use of pcbs 
cleco may continue to operate equipment containing pcbs under the tsca 
once the equipment reaches the end of its usefulness  the epa regulates handling and disposal of the equipment and fluids containing pcbs 
within these regulations  the handling and disposal is allowed only through epa approved and permitted facilities 
the epa revised tsca regulations to require utilities to report data on the manufacture or import of organic compounds every five years 
cleco submitted this information in december for its applicable facilities 
toxics release inventory tri the tri requires an annual report from industrial facilities on about substances that they release into air  water  and land 
the tri ranks companies based on how much of a particular substance they release on a state and parish county level 
annual reports are due to the epa on july following the reporting year end 
cleco has submitted required tri reports on its activities  and the tri rankings are available to the public 
the rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties 
on october   cleco received a special notice for remedial investigation and feasibility study from the epa 
the special notice requested that cleco corporation and cleco power  along with many other listed potentially responsible parties  enter into negotiations with the epa for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study at an area known as the devil s swamp lake just northwest of baton rouge  louisiana 
the epa has identified cleco as one of many companies sending pcb wastes for disposal to the site 
the devil s swamp lake site has been proposed to be added to the national priorities list npl based on the release of pcbs to fisheries and wetlands located on the site 
the epa will make a final decision on the listing of the site to the npl after considering relevant comments 
cleco has contacted the epa in response to the special notice and is reviewing the available information 
the epa and a number of prps met on january   for an organizational meeting to discuss the background of the site 
the prps began discussing a potential proposal to the epa on february  since this investigation is in the preliminary stages  management is unable to determine whether the costs associated with possible remediation of the facility site will have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
electric and magnetic fields emfs the possibility that exposure to emfs emanating from electric power lines  household appliances  and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects or damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention 
cleco power funds scientific research on emfs through various organizations 
to date  there are no definitive results  but research is continuing 
lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and or property values have arisen in several states 
cleco power is not a party in any lawsuits related to emfs 
item a 
risk factors the following risk factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the registrants 
rodemacher unit construction costs the recovery of costs incurred to construct rodemacher unit is subject to lpsc review and approval  and some of the costs could be disallowed 
costs incurred in the construction of rodemacher unit are subject to a prudency review by the lpsc 
at least one year prior to the in service date of rodemacher unit  cleco power will file a rate case with the lpsc seeking to recover the construction costs in its base rates 
cleco power will be required to demonstrate that the costs incurred to construct rodemacher unit were prudently incurred and demonstrate the impact of the operation of the facility on its customers 
accordingly  cleco power may not be able to recover some of the costs incurred to construct the facility  which could be substantial 
furthermore  although the amended epc contract is generally a fixed price agreement  unforeseen events could result in changes in the scope of the project that may result in a delay in the completion of rodemacher unit or result in additional costs 
it may be more difficult to obtain lpsc approval to recover such additional costs 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover substantial costs incurred in the construction of the facility  such a decision could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
rodemacher unit technical specifications cleco power is exposed to certain risks related to the design  construction and operation of rodemacher unit this project has technology risk  fuel supply risk and general contractor and certain material subcontractor performance risk 
rodemacher unit is designed to utilize circulating fluidized bed cfb generating technology 
under the amended epc contract  shaw is liable for liquidated damages for non performance 
however  cleco power s ability to collect any damages for breach is contingent on the demonstration of such damages and on shaw s financial abilities 
failure by shaw to meet its obligations under the amended epc contract could have a material adverse impact on the plant s cleco corporation cleco power form k efficiency  in service date  and final cost 
the amended epc contract does not protect cleco power against force majeure events or design specification oversight which may result in increased and potentially unrecoverable costs to cleco power 
although cleco power currently delivers coal via rail to the rodemacher facility  plans are for rodemacher unit to primarily use petroleum coke  which can be delivered most economically via barges on the mississippi and red rivers  requiring a conveyor system which has to cross an interstate and local highways 
navigable waterway events such as blockages or low water  or conveyor outages could impact cleco power s ability to transport and deliver fuel to rodemacher unit cleco power s rates and upcoming rate case the lpsc regulates the rates that cleco power can charge its customers 
cleco power is preparing to file a rate case for its rates that will go into effect when rodemacher unit starts commercial operations 
the lpsc could disallow the recovery of material costs or an adequate return on capital 
cleco power s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability to recover its costs from its customers in a timely manner through its lpsc approved rates and its ability to pass through to its customers in rates its ferc authorized revenue requirements 
cleco power s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital  including long term debt and equity 
if cleco power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital  its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
cleco power s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases 
during those cases  the lpsc determines cleco power s rate base  depreciation rates  operation and maintenance costs  and administrative and general costs that cleco power may recover from its retail customers through its rates 
these proceedings may examine  among other things  the prudence of the company s operation and maintenance practices  level of subject expenditures  allowed rates of return  and previously incurred capital expenditures 
the lpsc has the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred 
these regulatory proceedings typically involve multiple parties  including governmental bodies and officials  consumer advocacy groups  and various consumers of energy  who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates 
rate cases generally have long timelines  which may or may not be limited by statute 
decisions are typically subject to appeal  potentially leading to additional uncertainty 
cleco power s current base rates have been extended through the start of rodemacher unit currently  cleco power plans on filing a rate case at least one year prior to the completion of rodemacher unit to establish new rates to be effective upon commercial operation of the unit 
cleco power s current base rates allow it the opportunity to earn a maximum regulated return on equity of  which is based on a return on equity of  with any regulated earnings between and shared between shareholders and customers in a ratio 
if the lpsc does not increase cleco power s base rates or denies cleco power s request to recover costs incurred in the construction of rodemacher unit  cleco power s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
fuel cost audits the lpsc conducts fuel audits that could result in cleco power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue 
generally  fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the lpsc established fuel adjustment clause  which enables cleco power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to refund until monthly approval is received from the lpsc  however  all amounts are subject to a periodic fuel audit by the lpsc 
in july  the lpsc commenced a periodic fuel audit of cleco power s fuel adjustment clause filings for january through december cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of this audit  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the most recent audit completed by the lpsc covered and and resulted in a refund of million to cleco power s retail customers in the first quarter of hedging and risk management activities cleco power is subject to market risk associated with economic hedges relating to open natural gas contracts 
cleco has risk management policies which cannot eliminate all risk involved in its energy commodity activities 
cleco power utilizes economic hedges to mitigate the risks associated with a fixed price wholesale power contract that is not included in the fuel adjustment clause 
any realized gain or loss attributable to these hedges is recorded on the income statement as a component of operating revenue  net 
accordingly  changes in the market value of these hedging arrangements caused by natural gas price volatility will impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power also has entered into economic hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers 
when these positions close  actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the fuel adjustment clause in the month the physical contract settles 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
cleco power manages its exposure to energy commodity activities by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk cleco corporation cleco power form k management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures may not be as effective as planned and cannot eliminate all risk associated with these activities 
future electricity sales cleco power s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
general market conditions can negatively impact the businesses of cleco power s industrial customers  resulting in decreased power purchases and lower base revenue 
cleco power s largest industrial customers  specifically those who manufacture wood and paper products who generated base revenue of approximately million in  have experienced a downturn in their respective markets 
the downturn in residential home construction has caused a significant reduction in the demand and prices for lumber and other wood products 
the paper industry has been vulnerable in recent years as a result of a mature market with pressures from overseas manufacturers 
the rice and sugar cane industries  although recovered from the damage caused by the hurricane season  remain vulnerable to competition from overseas processors 
reduced production or the shut down of any of these customers facilities could substantially reduce cleco power s base revenue 
the high cost of energy  in general  has become problematic in many industries and has increased interest by industrial customers in switching to alternative sources of energy  including on site power generation 
also  retail customers may consume less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or increased electric usage efficiency 
purchased power nonperformance of cleco power s power purchase agreements and transmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power does not supply all of its customers power from the generation facilities it owns and must purchase additional energy and capacity from the wholesale power market in order to meet customers demands 
during  cleco power met approximately of its energy needs with purchased power 
a mw power purchase agreement with bear energy lp  which expires in  and other short and long term power purchase agreements provided approximately of cleco power s capacity needs in in november  williams completed the assignment of this purchase power agreement to bear energy lp  and the terms of the agreement remained unchanged 
cleco power plans to meet its energy and capacity needs with the bear energy lp mw contract  a mw contract with nrg power marketing  inc  a mw contract with union power partners  l 
p  a mw long term contract with sabine river authority  and a mw wholesale power contract with the city of natchitoches 
in january  cleco power was notified by upp that the firm transmission path associated with delivering the contract capacity and energy from the upp facility for the month of august had been curtailed 
upp has informed cleco that it anticipates acquiring additional firm transmission to supply the august contract quantity as required under the power purchase agreement 
however  if upp or any other provider of additional energy or capacity does not perform under their respective contracts  cleco power would have to replace these supply sources with alternative market sources  the terms of which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of power to cleco power s customers 
because of cleco power s location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  physical constraints limit the amount of purchased power these transmission providers can deliver into cleco power s service territory  which in turn can affect capacity or power purchases under long term contracts  as well as spot market power purchases 
if the amount of purchased power actually delivered into cleco s transmission system were less than the amount of power contracted for delivery  cleco power may rely on its own generation facilities to meet customer demand 
cleco power s incremental generation cost at that time could be higher than the cost to purchase power from the wholesale power market  thereby increasing its customers ultimate cost 
in addition  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover part or all of its incremental generation cost  which could be substantial 
weather sensitivity the operating results of cleco power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity  particularly kwh sales to residential customers 
in cleco power s service territory  like in many parts of the country  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market power prices also peaking at that time 
as a result  cleco power s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
in addition  cleco power has sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could adversely impact the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
severe weather  including hurricanes and winter storms  can be destructive  causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenue 
commodity prices cleco power is subject to the fluctuation in the market prices of various commodities which may increase the cost of producing power 
cleco power purchases coal  lignite  natural gas and fuel oil under long term contracts and on the spot market 
historically  the markets for oil  natural gas and coal have been cleco corporation cleco power form k volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
cleco power s retail rates include a fuel adjustment clause that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
evangeline plant performance evangeline has certain plant performance obligations defined in its tolling agreement 
failure to perform these obligations could expose evangeline to adverse financial penalties 
performance requirements in the evangeline tolling agreement include  but are not limited to  maintaining plant performance characteristics such as heat rate and demonstrated generation capacity and maintaining specified availability levels with a combination of plant availability and replacement power 
obligations under the tolling agreement include  but are not limited to  maintaining various types of insurance  maintaining power and natural gas metering equipment  and paying scheduled interest and principal payments on debt 
in addition to the performance obligations by evangeline  there are a guarantee and various commitments required by cleco corporation 
if evangeline fails to operate within specified requirements  the facility may purchase replacement power on the open market and provide it to the tolling counterparty in order to meet contractual performance specifications 
providing replacement power maintains availability levels  but exposes evangeline to power commodity price volatility and transmission constraints 
if availability targets under the tolling agreement are not met and economical purchased power and transmission are not available  cleco corporation s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
cleco power generation facilities cleco power s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements and interruption of fuel deliveries 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
some of cleco power s facilities were originally constructed many years ago 
older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency or availability 
if cleco power fails to make adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance  cleco power risks incurring more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel or power purchase costs and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
cleco power s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal  natural gas and lignite 
the deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances or lack of transportation capacity 
if the suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel  cleco power would have to replace any deficiency with alternative sources  which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of fuel to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered from customers through the fuel adjustment clause  which is subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the lpsc 
ero in  the ferc s authority was expanded to include the establishment and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards on the transmission system  as well as the capacity to impose fines and civil penalties on those who fail to comply with those standards 
the energy policy act of authorizes the creation of an ero with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards  subject to ferc approval  for users of the nation s transmission system 
in july  the ferc named the nerc as the ero 
the ferc has approved more than reliability standards developed by nerc 
a final order was issued by the ferc in march  and in june the ferc began enforcing compliance with these standards 
new standards are continually being developed and existing standards will be modified as needed 
as these standards continue to be adopted and modified  they may impose additional compliance requirements on cleco power  acadia  attala  evangeline  and perryville operations which may result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
failure to comply with the reliability standards approved by the ferc can result in the imposition of fines and civil penalties 
environmental compliance cleco s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant 
the costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations  as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities  could also be significant to the registrants 
cleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal  state and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and health and safety 
cleco is also required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities 
existing environmental laws  regulations and permits could be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to cleco  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
for example  congress is considering climate change legislation that  if ultimately enacted  could impose a cap on carbon dioxide emissions by electric generating units such as cleco and subject electric generating units to an emissions allowance based trading system 
cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with cleco corporation cleco power form k these revisions  reinterpretations and new requirements 
if cleco fails to comply with these revisions  reinterpretations and requirements  it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce productions from its facilities 
environmental advocacy groups  states  other organizations and some government agencies in the united states are focusing considerable attention on carbon dioxide emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change 
future changes in environmental regulations governing co could make some of cleco s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
in addition  any legal obligation that would require cleco to substantially reduce its co emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
cleco power may request recovery from its retail customers of its costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  such an adverse decision could have a material effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
regulatory compliance cleco operates in a highly regulated environment and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the registrants businesses or result in significant additional costs 
cleco s business is subject to extensive federal  state and local energy  environmental and other laws and regulations 
the lpsc regulates cleco s retail operations  and the ferc regulates cleco s wholesale operations 
the construction  planning  and siting of cleco s power plants and transmission lines are also subject to the jurisdiction of the lpsc and the ferc 
additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of cleco s operations and construction projects including the epa  the united states bureau of land management  the united states fish and wildlife services  the united states department of energy  the united states army corps of engineers  the united states department of homeland security  the occupational safety and health administration  the united states department of transportation  the ldeq  the louisiana department of health and hospitals  the louisiana department of natural resources  the louisiana department of public safety  regional water quality boards and various local regulatory districts 
cleco must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders 
should cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on cleco  cleco s business could be adversely affected 
existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to cleco or cleco s facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on the registrants business or result in significant additional costs because of cleco s need to comply with those requirements 
termination of the rodemacher unit project or the amended epc contract the abandonment of the rodemacher unit project or termination of the amended epc contract could result in unrecoverable costs 
cleco power may determine that its decision to construct  own and operate rodemacher unit is no longer justified due to changes in circumstances or for other reasons 
if cleco power decided to abandon the project  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover some or all of its incurred costs 
the amended epc contract allows cleco power to terminate the agreement at its sole discretion  but exercise of this termination right would require cleco power to pay termination costs  subject to specified limitations  to shaw 
termination costs under the amended epc contract are substantial and increase significantly as the project progresses 
retail electric service cleco power s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the lpsc 
cleco power s retail rates for residential  commercial  and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the lpsc  which conducts an annual review of cleco power s earnings and regulatory return on equity 
cleco power files annual monitoring reports with the lpsc for the month period ended september cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the lpsc review  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco credit ratings a downgrade in cleco corporation s or cleco power s credit rating could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs and a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources 
while the senior unsecured debt ratings of cleco corporation and cleco power are currently investment grade  in recent years such ratings have been downgraded or put on negative watch by moody s and standard poor s 
cleco corporation or cleco power cannot assure that its debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
if moody s or standard poor s were to downgrade cleco corporation or cleco power s long term ratings  particularly below investment grade  the value of their debt securities would likely be adversely affected  and the borrowing cost of cleco corporation cleco corporation cleco power form k or cleco power would likely increase 
in addition  cleco corporation or cleco power would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings and be subject to more onerous debt covenants  and its pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease 
holding company cleco corporation is a holding company  and its ability to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries 
cleco corporation is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries 
substantially all of cleco s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  cleco s ability to meet its debt obligations  which at december   consisted of million of senior notes due in  and to pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries 
cleco s subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on cleco s debt or to make any funds available for such payment 
in addition  cleco s subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to cleco may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors 
moreover  cleco power  cleco s principal subsidiary  is subject to regulation by the lpsc  which may impose limits on the amount of dividends that cleco power may pay cleco corporation 
bear stearns companies inc failure by bear stearns companies inc to fulfill its guarantee obligations under the evangeline tolling agreement could have a material adverse effect on cleco s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
bear stearns companies inc guarantees the payment obligations of bear energy lp under the evangeline tolling agreement 
if bear stearns companies inc were to fail to perform its payment obligations  such failure could have a material adverse effect on cleco corporation s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows for the following reasons  among others if the failure of bear stearns companies inc to perform constituted a default under the tolling agreement  the holders of the evangeline bonds would have the right to declare the outstanding principal amount million at december  and interest to be immediately due and payable  which could result in cleco s seeking to refinance the bonds  the terms of which may be less favorable than existing terms  cleco s causing evangeline to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws  or the trustee of the bonds foreclosing on the mortgage and assuming ownership of the evangeline plant  cleco may not be able to enter into agreements in replacement of the evangeline tolling agreement on terms as favorable as that agreement or at all  cleco s equity investment in evangeline may be impaired  requiring a write down to its fair market value  which could be substantial  and cleco s credit ratings could be downgraded  which would increase borrowing costs and limit sources of financing 
evangeline and acadia generation facilities evangeline s and acadia s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements  interruption of fuel deliveries and transmission constraints 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
if adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance are not made  a facility may incur more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel costs and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
evangeline s and acadia s generating facilities are fueled by natural gas 
the deliverability of this fuel source may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances or lack of transportation capacity 
because of acadia s location on the transmission grid  acadia relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  physical constraints limit the amount of power these transmission providers can deliver
