our media products include pressure sensitive bar code labels and thermal transfer ribbons  which are sold to customers worldwide 
we also design and manufacture specialized labels to meet customer requirements for extreme environments such as clean rooms  chemical baths and high humidity 
radio frequency identification rfid products rfid facilitates wireless communication of product information that exceeds the information available from a barcode 
this communication occurs between a rfid reader and rfid tags comprising a computer chip and antenna encased in a protective covering 
rfid tags are programmed by users to contain identification  serial numbers  history and other product data 
certain rfid tags contain read write memory to allow updates and tag reuse 
unlike laser scanned bar codes  rfid tags do not require line of sight to be read 
customers are increasingly using rfid technology to track pallets  cartons  containers and individual items through their supply chains and for enterprise asset management 
our rfid product line is focused on passive uhf technology and consists of rfid tags  readers  software and related equipment sold under the intermec trade name 
our rfid products comply with the epcglobal generation uhf standard the gen standard and with other epcglobal and international standards organization iso standards being adopted by customers worldwide 
we have approximately rfid patents and more than companies have taken royalty bearing licenses under those patents  including but not limited to cisco  motorola  inc  texas instruments  avery dennison  honeywell corporation and zebra technologies  inc item business continued services with our large variety of customer support services  professional services and installation services  we help customers design  implement and deploy aidc systems in their businesses 
our project management teams create strategic plans that identify the customer s operational goals and aidc solutions that will accomplish our customers business objectives 
our project management teams further define the functional requirements for implementing aidc products and systems in the customer s business environment 
our project management teams prepare an implementation plan  evaluate adic products and integrate new aidc products into the customer s existing system 
because we have relationships with many vendors that provide complementary aidc products  systems and services  we offer customers a one stop shopping service experience and comprehensive aidc solutions 
we provide technical support and repair services through a global network of service and technical support 
through our global education services unit  we also provide aidc training services  including the design and delivery of training programs for our customers employees 
item business continued business strategy the key elements of our strategy are to target high growth opportunities in selected industry and application markets  focus on developing and selling differentiated new products  emphasize channel fulfillment  concentrate on global market expansion opportunities  and  continue our supply chain transformation 
we are focused on private and public sector customers in the following vertical markets industrial goods 
this vertical market includes firms primarily involved in business to business commerce 
they supply raw materials  components and assemblies to consumer goods manufacturers and service providers eg  aerospace  chemical  oil and gas  and electronics 
this vertical also includes firms that produce large  durable goods for businesses and consumers eg  automobiles  computers and household appliances 
transportation and logistics 
this vertical market consists of firms providing shipping and transportation services with their own equipment  as well as non asset based logistics providers 
the most common non asset firms are third party logistics and fourth party logistics providers 
segments within this vertical include motor freight  air transport  railways  waterborne transportation and logistics service providers 
consumer goods 
this vertical market includes firms that make products for retailers and those that sell directly to thegeneral public 
segments within the vertical include food  beverage  consumer packaged goods  footwear apparel  health beauty  health pharmacy  housewares appliances  electronics  recreation  and media publishing companies 
retail 
this is a large  competitive and mature vertical market 
customers in this vertical include global tier companies with billion or more in sales 
segments within the vertical range from grocery  pharmaceutical and specialty outlets to department stores and warehouse style mega stores 
item business continued we are focused on the following applications warehouse operations 
in many warehouses  wireless networks and handheld and mobile devices are used to transmit data regarding the movement  location  quantity and attributes of inventory in the warehouse to central host computers 
this gives customers greater visibility to their business operations  helps them to avoid inventory shortages and allows them to provide more accurate shipping and delivery information to their customers 
as competition places more pressure on companies for faster operational performance  they typically upgrade their supply chain technologies to improve working capital efficiency  delivery speed  in stock availability and order accuracy 
enterprise asset management 
most firms have a certain percentage of staff responsible for the on going maintenance of property  plant store and equipment 
in addition  other personnel are involved in intermittent break fix field service repair operations 
both of these employee groups are increasingly being equipped with automation technology to aid and monitor their functions and to track the assets they use to do the work such as repair parts  maintenance supplies  repair tools and test equipment 
intermec and our value added resellers supply the equipment and software solutions to schedule  assist and monitor these processes  including mobile computers  bar code scanners  rfid tags and readers  and label printing solutions 
in transit visibility 
transportation customers want to know where their shipment is  who picked up a package or shipment  when it was delivered  what condition it was in on delivery  and who signed for it 
whether the transporter is a private fleet or third party logistics provider using for hire air  truck  railway or ocean container operations  the increasing cost of assets  wages  fuel and insurance and operating ratios that run around requires maximum use of assets 
this means turning them faster  eliminating empty return runs  reducing equipment downtime and optimizing effective  efficient maintenance 
all forms of transportation use some form of carrier specified numbering to identify the parcels  pallets or containers that make up a shipment for a particular customer 
mobile computing devices linked with bar code labels and or rfid tags can provide signature capture and critical item tracking capabilities 
direct store delivery dsd 
dsd is the delivery of consumer good products from a supplier distributor directly to a retailstore  bypassing a retailer s warehouse 
dsd activities typically include in store inventory management  store levelauthorized item management  store level ordering forecasting  product pricing  promotion  invoicing  the physical delivery and return of merchandise  the electronic exchange of delivery data with a retail store dex ucs and shelf merchandising 
item business continued markets and customers because aidc solutions can be used by a company of any size  the aidc market is large 
market growth is driven by the need for technologies and solutions that improve quality  productivity and cost 
we cover the market through a combination of a globally coordinated dedicated sales and service organization  two tier distributors  resellers and independent hardware  software and service vendors 
our direct sales organization serves customers from offices throughout the americas  europe  the middle east and africa and in selected asia pacific countries  including china and australia 
our indirect sales channel is also global and includes preferred and non exclusive relationships with value added distributors and resellers 
we have a field based business development function  which identifies new market opportunities and supports the sales effort in those new areas 
international sales opportunities exist in countries where communications infrastructure  mobile computing practices and other systems and applications are similar to those in the u 
s or that are in the process of creating such infrastructure 
the extent of wireless systems opportunities in any particular country is based on the level of industrialization  the condition of communication infrastructure  the level of computerization  the status of bar code implementation  and the regulatory environment for wireless communication technologies 
item business continued our customer base consists of private and public entities of many sizes 
in and  one customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
total sales to this customer were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in competition the market for aidc products is fragmented  highly competitive and rapidly changing 
independent market surveys suggest that we are one of the larger participants measured by revenues 
motorola  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  symbol technologies  inc  are major competitors  supplying a range of barcode  rfid and mobile computing products and services 
we also face strong competition in individual aidc product lines from suppliers such as zebra technologies corporation  which supplies barcode and rfid printers  and hand held products  recently acquired by honeywell corporation  which supplies barcode imagers 
in the label media area  we face competition from a large number of large and small media producers  including  among many others  avery denison and brady 
we compete primarily on the basis of our technology and expertise in our target vertical markets  but our support services  product functionality  performance  ruggedness and overall product quality  are also important elements of our competitive offerings 
research and development research and development expenditures related to our continuing operations amounted to million  million and million  all of which we sponsored in the years ended december   and  respectively 
intellectual property we strive to protect our investment in technology and to secure competitive advantage by obtaining ip protection within and outside of the united states 
we have obtained approximately patents and a number of trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
when appropriate  we have obtained licenses to use ip controlled by other organizations 
the combination of our ip and our licenses to use third party ip has been of value in the growth of our business and is expected to be of value in the future 
however  we do not believe that our business depends on any single patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret or on any single ip license agreement 
we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination of any particular intellectual property rights 
item business continued we believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
because of the fast pace of innovation and product development in the aidc industry  our products may become obsolete before the patents related to them expire  and sometimes become obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted 
as we expand our product offerings  we try to obtain patents related to such offerings and  when appropriate  seek licenses to use inventions patented by third parties 
to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors  we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names  and as we expand our product and service offerings  we try to obtain trademarks and trade names to cover those new offerings 
we protect certain details of our processes  products and strategies as trade secrets by restricting access to that information 
we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 
from time to time  we license our ip to generate revenue or to facilitate our effort to market and sell our products and services 
while such licenses have been of value in the growth of our business in the past and are expected to be of value in the future  we do not believe that our business is dependent upon any single ip license and would not be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof 
we try to protect our investment in technology  generate revenue and secure competitive advantage by enforcing our ip rights 
the nature  timing and geographic location of these efforts depends  in part  on the types of legal protection given to different types of ip rights in various countries 
seasonality and backlog our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services  since our revenues are typically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest in the first fiscal quarter 
see quarterly financial information on page of this form k for quarterly revenues and expenses 
sales backlog from our continuing operations was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
our business typically operates without a significant backlog of firm orders  and we do not consider backlog to be a significant measure for indicating future sales 
employees at december   we had  full time employees  of which  were engaged in our wholly owned subsidiary  intermec technologies corporation  and were engaged in our holding company  intermec  inc approximately of our full time employees are in the united states  approximately are in europe  the middle east and africa emea  and the remaining are employed throughout the rest of the world  including the asia pacific region  south america  canada and mexico

mr 
wills previously served as our vice president general manager  global services rfid from september to december prior thereto  mr 
wills was vice president general manager  printers and media  from april to september item business continued environmental and regulatory matters in january  the european parliament and council adopted directive ec on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the rohs directive went into effect on july   and prohibits firms from putting on the european union eu market new electrical and electronic equipment that contains more than permitted levels of lead  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyl pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde 
the rohs directive does not apply to units of equipment already placed on the eu market prior to july  in addition  the rohs directive contains exemptions for a certain types of equipment  b reuse of equipment placed on the eu market prior to july   and c spare parts for the repair of equipment placed on the eu market prior to july  the state of california also has adopted restrictions on the use of certain materials in electronic products that are intended to harmonize with the rohs directive 
those restrictions went into effect in other us states are considering similar legislation or in the process of implementing enacted legislation 
similarly  china has promulgated environmental regulations covering the same substances as the rohs directive 
china s regulations became effective on march  and imposed various marking and substance content disclosures above defined thresholds of electronic products imported into china 
we have implemented a program to comply with these requirements 
china has not yet defined the list of specific products for which the substance content will be restricted or the effective date of any imposed restrictions 
it is unclear whether china s use restrictions will be consistent with the use restrictions set forth in the rohs directive 
other countries outside of the eu and china are in various stages of establishing rohs requirements and may adopt rohs type regulations in the future 
in addition  the state of california adopted restrictions on the energy efficiency of external alternating current power supplies used with many of the products we manufacture and sell 
in  we spent million for our product and system re certification to us requirements due to migration to newer  more efficient power supplies 
additional certification costs may be incurred in and beyond as similar requirements are adopted in other countries in which we sell or intend to sell 
we have redesigned some of our current products to bring them into compliance with the rohs directive and similar regulations in other jurisdictions 
in other cases  we are replacing non compliant products with new products that comply with these regulations 
during  we spent million  primarily related to redesigning products  to comply with these regulations 
we expect to incur additional costs in the future for compliance with the rohs directive and similar regulations in other jurisdictions 
the amount and timing of such expenditures are uncertain due to uncertainties about the effective date and final content of rohs type regulations in various jurisdictions and the possibility that rohs type regulations in one jurisdiction will not be consistent with rohs type regulations in other jurisdictions 
radio emissions are the subject of governmental regulation in all countries in which we currently conduct or expect to conduct business 
in north america  both the canadian and us governments publish radio emission regulations and changes thereto after public hearings 
in other countries  regulatory changes can be introduced with little or no grace period for implementation 
furthermore  there is little consistency among the regulations of various countries 
future regulatory changes in north america  china and other jurisdictions are possible 
these conditions introduce uncertainty into our product planning process and could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our wireless products in a given country or adversely affect our cost of supplying wireless products in a given country 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products and we obtain such raw materials from a variety of suppliers 
in general  the raw materials we use are available from numerous alternative sources 
as is customary for our industry  we at various times enter into certain single source component part supply agreements 
we believe these agreements will be renewed in the ordinary course of business 
item a 
risk factors you are encouraged to review the discussion of forward looking statements and risk factors appearing in this report at part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  you should carefully consider the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could lead to decreases in demand for our products or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable 
domestic and international political and economic conditions are uncertain due to a variety of factors  including global conflict  the risk of terrorism and war in a given country or region  public health issues  economic downturns  volatility in stock and credit markets  and rising energy costs 
a deterioration of political or economic conditions in a given country or region could affect potential customers in a way that reduces demand for our products and disrupts our manufacturing and sales plans 
in addition  our sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms that are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in the country in which the customer is located 
a deterioration of political or economic conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect on accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
business combinations  private equity transactions and similar events are altering the structure of the aidc industry and could intensify competition 
large  well financed companies and private equity groups have been acquiring companies in the automatic identification and data capture aidc industry 
as examples  motorola acquired symbol technologies  inc  a private equity group led by francisco partners acquired metrologic instruments  honeywell acquired hand held products  inc  and zebra technologies acquired wherenet  navis holdings llc and proveo ag 
these acquisitions and other similar events have altered the structure of the aidc industry and may spawn more transactions and additional structural changes 
these events could intensify competition within the aidc industry by expanding the presence of companies that have greater business and financial resources than the competitors that they acquired and by increasing the market share of some companies in our industry 
such increased competition could have material adverse impacts to our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any of the strategies we employ to react to the structural changes and related increased competition in our industry will be successful 
some of our competitors are substantially larger or more profitable than we are  which may give them a competitive advantage 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
due to acquisitions and the consolidation of the aidc industry  competition is likely to intensify 
some of our competitors have substantially more revenue or profit than we do 
the scale advantage of these companies may allow them to invest more in research and development r d  sales and marketing  and customer support than we can 
the scale advantage may also allow them to acquire or make complementary products that alone or in combination with other aidc products could afford them a competitive advantage 
these advantages may enable our larger competitors to weather market downturns longer or adapt more quickly to emerging technology developments  market trends or price declines than we can 
those competitors may also be able to precipitate such market changes by introducing new technologies  reducing their prices or otherwise changing their activities 
there is no assurance that our strategies to counteract our competitors advantages will successfully offset all or a portion of this scale imbalance 
if we are unable to offset all or a significant portion of this imbalance  our earnings may be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
risk factors continued we face risks as a global company that could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our business  we face risks that companies operating in a single country or region do not have 
us and foreign government restrictions on the export or import of technology could prevent us from selling some or all of our products in one or more countries 
our sales could also be materially and adversely affected by burdensome laws  regulations  security requirements  tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
in addition  political and economic instability in a particular country or region could reduce demand for our products or impair or eliminate our ability to sell or deliver those products to customers in those countries or put our assets at risk 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability continue or expand sales of our products in any market  and disruptions of our sales could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations 
a significant percentage of our products and components for those products are designed  manufactured  produced  delivered  serviced or supported in countries outside of the us from time to time  we contract with companies outside of the us to perform one or more of these activities  or portions of these activities 
for operational  legal or other reasons  we may have to change the mix of domestic and international operations or move outsourced activities from one overseas vendor to another 
in addition  us or foreign government actions or economic or political instability and potentially weaker foreign intellectual property protections may disrupt or require changes in our international operations or international outsourcing arrangements 
the process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex and can be expensive 
there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks in an efficient or cost effective manner  if at all 
if we encounter difficulties in making such transitions  our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to improve our business processes and systems and attract and retain skilled managers and employees 
in order to increase sales and profits  we must continue to expand our operations into new product and geographic markets and deepen our penetration of the markets we currently serve  and do so in efficient and cost effective ways 
to achieve our objectives  we need to continue to improve our business processes and our financial  information technology and enterprise resource planning systems 
from time to time we may have to restructure our business to react to changing technology  products and markets 
successful completion of these projects will require skillful managers and a skilled workforce 
competition for skilled employees is high in our industry  and we must remain competitive in terms of compensation and other employee benefits to retain key employees 
if we are unsuccessful in hiring and retaining skilled managers and employees we will be unable to maintain and expand our business 
our use of third party suppliers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we use third party suppliers to produce some of our products or to provide components of our products 
we may be impacted by the quality control of these third party suppliers or by their ability to meet our delivery deadlines 
products or components may be available only from a single source or limited sources  and we may be unable to find alternative sources of supply on a timely basis 
in addition to offering our products directly  we also offer our products through third party distributors and may be impacted by changes affecting these distributors  including their ability to bring our products to market at the right times and in the right locations 
a disruption in third party suppliers or third party distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success depends upon the timely introduction of new products and our ability to mitigate the risk of product obsolescence 
customer requirements for aidc products are rapidly evolving and technological changes in our industry occur rapidly 
to keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish intermec from our competitors  we must frequently introduce new products and enhancements of existing products through potentially significant investments in r d 
we may not have adequate resources to invest in r d that will keep pace with technological changes in our industry  and any such investments may not result in competitive products 
furthermore  we may be unable to timely launch new products before our competition launches comparable products 
any of these factors could cause our business to suffer 
rapid technological change  whether through our or our competitors introduction of new products or technologies  could also render our products obsolete and result in substantial excess inventories 
in such event  we might have to sell all or a portion of the excess or obsolete inventory at a substantial discount to the planned resale price or the cost of making or acquiring that inventory and write off the difference 
if our response to technological changes and our ability to introduce new products and product enhancements is not effective  and we do not mitigate the risk of product obsolescence  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
risk factors continued growth of and changes in our revenues and profits depend on our customer mix and sales mix 
fluctuations in our customer mix or our sales mix could result in volatility in our revenues  gross margins and profits 
sales to large enterprises tend to have lower product prices and gross margins than sales to medium and small businesses 
the gross margins of the products and services we sell vary 
therefore  growth in our revenues and profits will depend on a favorable mix of customers for our products and services and on a favorable mix of the products and services we sell 
if we fail to execute a sales strategy that will result in a favorable customer mix or a favorable sales mix of product and services  our gross margins and profitability may decline  even though our revenues may increase 
furthermore  changes in our customer mix or our sales mix of product and services from quarter to quarter and year to year may cause our revenues  gross margins and profit margins to be volatile and difficult to predict 
growth in our revenues and profits depends  in part  on development of the rfid market 
there is uncertainty about the volume and the timing of demand for rfid products in the vertical markets and applications that we target 
potential rfid customers typically use pilot programs  qualification processes and certification processes to determine whether to acquire an rfid system and which vendor s products and systems to buy 
we cannot predict how fast the rfid market will grow or how large it will become 
if it grows into a significant market  we may be unable to penetrate that market successfully 
failure of the rfid market to grow significantly or our failure to penetrate that market successfully could adversely affect our revenue growth and profitability 
our failure to enhance and further develop our patent portfolio or to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and defend against infringement claims could adversely affect the growth of our business and our results of operations 
one element of our strategy to compete in our industry is to expand our aidc patent portfolio to differentiate our products from those of our competitors and to generate royalty income 
the development and maintenance of a patent portfolio are complex and costly activities with uncertain outcomes 
our ability to obtain patent protection domestically or internationally for our inventions can be adversely affected by changes in patent laws  treaties  and regulations and by judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws treaties and regulations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain valuable aidc patents in the jurisdictions where we and our competitors operate or that we will be able to use or license those patents to differentiate our products in the marketplace or to generate meaningful royalty revenue 
to protect our patent portfolio  we may be required to initiate patent infringement lawsuits 
patent lawsuits are complex proceedings and the results are very difficult to predict 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in all or any of these cases 
adverse results in such patent lawsuits could give competitors the legal right to compete with us and with our licensees using technology that is similar to or the same as ours 
adverse outcomes in patent lawsuits could also reduce our royalty revenues 
in some periods  patent litigation recoveries and expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods  increasing the volatility of our financial results and possibly impacting our earnings per share 
since our business strategy includes global expansion  we are operating in developing countries eg  china where the institutional structures for creating and enforcing intellectual property rights are very new and where government agencies  courts and market participants have little experience with intellectual property rights 
there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology in such countries because we may not be able to obtain or enforce patents or other intellectual property rights in those jurisdictions and alternative methods of protecting our technology may not be effective 
our inability to prevent competitors in these developing markets from misappropriating our technology could materially and adversely affect our sales  revenues and results of operations 
our competitors  potential competitors and companies that purchase and enforce patents may have patents covering aidc products and services similar to those we market and sell 
these firms may try to use their patents to prevent us from selling some of our aidc products  to collect royalties from us with respect to sales of products they claim are covered by their patents  or to deter us from enforcing our patents against them 
as part of this effort  the patent holders may initiate patent infringement lawsuits against us or our customers 
these lawsuits are complex proceedings with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we or our customers will prevail in any patent lawsuits initiated by third party patent holders 
if the results of such litigation are adverse to us or our customers  we could be enjoined from practicing an invention covered by the patent in question 
we could also be required to pay damages for past infringement  which might have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if an injunction is issued  we may not be able to sell a particular product or product line  which could materially and adversely impact our sales  revenues and results of operations 
if third party patent holders are willing to license or sell their patents to us  or if we must redesign the affected products  the associated costs could have a material and adverse effect on our sales  revenues or results of operations 
item a 
risk factors continued fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the cost of goods and services that we purchase 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to exchange rate changes by entering into short term currency exchange contracts 
there is no assurance that we will hedge or will be able to hedge such foreign currency exchange risk or that our hedges will be successful 
our currency exchange gains or losses net of hedges may materially and adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
additionally  adverse movements in currency exchange rates could result in increases in our cost of goods sold or reduction in growth in international orders  materially impacting our cash flows and earnings 
global regulation and regulatory compliance  including environmental  technological and standards setting regulations  may limit our sales or increase our costs  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to domestic and international technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of our products 
such standards and regulations may also require us to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
our ability to sell aidc products in a given country and the gross margins on products sold in a given country could be affected by such regulations 
we are also subject to self imposed standards setting activities sponsored by organizations such as iso  aim  ieee and epcglobal that provide our customers with the ability to seamlessly use our products with products from other aidc vendors  which our customers demand 
changes in standards and regulations may be introduced at any time and with little or no time to bring products into compliance with the revised technical standard or regulation 
standards and regulations may prevent us from selling one or more of our products in a particular country  increase our cost of supplying our products by requiring us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components  require us to obtain services or create infrastructure in a particular country to address collection  recycling and similar obligations  or require us to license our patents on a royalty free basis and prevent us from seeking damages and injunctive relief for patent infringements 
in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with our products or may have to incur unexpected costs to bring our products into compliance 
due to these uncertainties and compliance burdens  our customers may postpone or cancel purchases of our products 
as a result  global regulation and compliance could have an adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
seasonal variations in demand could increase the volatility of our financial results 
our revenues are affected by the seasonality of technology purchases and the timing of the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products 
our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services  as our revenues are historically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest in the first fiscal quarter 
revenues may also decline in quarters when our customers are anticipating new product introductions or significant product enhancements  but may increase significantly in quarters when we announce those product introductions or enhancements 
these fluctuations in demand may also impact our ability to manufacture and distribute products in an efficient manner 
any of these factors could increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and results of operations from one period to another 
item a 
risk factors continued our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 
due to the global nature of our business  we are subject to national and local taxation in many different countries and we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by the tax authorities in those countries 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
there is no assurance that all or any of these tax audits will be resolved in our favor 
our financial results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the periods when the tax assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on the tax assessments expire 
the outcome of these tax assessments could have a material positive or negative impact on our earnings and increase the volatility of our earnings relative to prior periods

the growth in systems and solutions resulted from growth rates of and in europe  the middle east and africa emea and the rest of the world row  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in north america 
the higher systems and solutions revenue in emea during was primarily attributable to strong market acceptance of new product introductions and a refreshed product line to be in compliance with the european union s reduction of hazardous substances rohs directive 
the growth in emea revenue also includes approximately million  or  from favorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to the lower systems and solutions revenue in north america during compared to reflects declining revenues in the first half of  as a result of lower enterprise sales and delays in customer purchases during our transition to newly introduced products  partially offset by growth in the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding period 
product revenues in decreased million  or  compared to the decline in product revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in systems and solutions products 
our analysis of the causal factors for the decline in product revenue suggests that the most significant factor was the announcement and availability of several new products in the third quarter of in the second half of the year  we introduced three new major products 
in light of this announcement  it is our belief that certain customers delayed orders awaiting the availability of the new products 
the second factor negatively impacting product revenue was the rohs restriction of hazardous substances directive  which became effective july   within the european union eu 
the third factor that contributed to the product revenue decline is the increase in competitive programs and pricing 
service revenues of million for are essentially flat with we experienced higher service revenue in emea and latin america during  primarily from the regional growth in product revenues  which was offset by a decrease in us government professional services and declines in time and material repairs

payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases note d purchase commitments total contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant estimates and assumptions were used to determine the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  tax valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  recoverability of other intangible assets  warranty costs  pension and post retirement obligations  fair value of pension assets  and stock based compensation 
despite these inherent limitations  we believe that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and our financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are generally recognized when products are shipped or services are rendered  the title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when the revenue is earned  the amount due is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service and maintenance revenue is recognized as services are rendered  generally over the contract term  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns  price protection  rebates and other offerings that occur under sales programs established by us directly or with our distributors and resellers 
we accrue the estimated cost of post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
we typically do not sell our software products without the related hardware 
our typical products require no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware after they are shipped 
for software sales  and hardware sales where the software is more than incidental  revenue is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as defined in the customer contract 
under our rapid start rfid intellectual property rfid ip licensing program  we license rights to use portions of our ip portfolio  including certain patents essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain rfid products and systems 
as a result of our rfid ip licensing program  which ended on august   we have expanded our revenue recognition policy to include the license fees from this program 
licensees participating in the rapid start program typically paid a nonrefundable up front fee and agreed to pay ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed rfid ip 
under the terms of such rapid start rfid license agreements  the licensees receive the right to certain future divisions  continuations and continuations in part of the licensed rfid patents 
non refundable up front fees and license transfer fees related to our rapid start rfid ip licensing program are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over five years  representing the estimated future period we expect to receive patents on certain divisions  continuations and or continuations in part for the licensed rfid patents and our estimate of the average technology lifecycle for the aidc industry 
we earn royalties on licensed rfid products sold by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees report and pay royalties owed for sales made in any given quarter after the conclusion of that quarter 
we recognize such royalty revenue in the period earned and reported from licensees 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial condition of our customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued inventory obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously written off inventory is sold 
income taxes 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent  feasible and permissible tax planning strategies in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
we conduct business in various countries throughout the world and are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of our business activities  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
we also record benefits from uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we recognize the largest amount of benefit greater than determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
such amounts are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
a majority of our finite lived intangible assets pertain to our patent portfolio and have estimated useful lives of years 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
warranty costs 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted expected cash flows to be generated by a long lived asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment to write down the long lived asset or asset group to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
discontinued operations 
divested businesses are classified in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
for businesses classified as discontinued operations  the balance sheet amounts and income statement results and cash flows are reclassified from their historical presentation to assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets  to profit or loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  and to cash flows from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented 
additionally  segment information does not include the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued patent costs 
we capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents where we believe that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased in accordance with statement of financial accounting concepts  elements of financial statements 
we monitor the legal costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action and  if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  capitalized costs are charged to in the period the change is determined 
patent costs are amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  in external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we have retirement plans that cover most of our employees 
some of these plans were frozen june annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contribution 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant internal data  such as the rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost projections are evaluated and updated annually 
note k to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates for our domestic and foreign plans 
we believe the assumptions are appropriate 
however  these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively impacting future results of operations 
the discount rate  used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rates for domestic and foreign plans as of december  were and  respectively  compared to and as of december  the increase in the discount rate used for domestic plans reflects higher interest rates in the current market 
a one half percentage point decrease in our discount rate on pension cost would result in an increase in benefit obligation of million 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  we use historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on our domestic and foreign plans was and  respectively 
the effect on our pension cost of a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would be an increase of million 
we determine the expected rate of compensation increase based on historic trends and comparisons to external rates 
for domestic plans  we concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation increase was necessary and continued to use 
for foreign plans  we concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation was necessary as there are no active employees covered under the plans 
actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of  and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on our postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over seven years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation would result in an increase of approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease would result in a decrease of million 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 which requires that the consolidated statements of financial position reflect the funded status of the pension and postretirement plans see note k  pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in future reporting periods  the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions will be recognized in other comprehensive loss in the period in which they occur 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingencies 
we assess our exposure to loss contingencies  including environmental  legal and income tax matters  and provide for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from our estimates  results of operations are adjusted upward or downward 
stock based compensation 
as of december   we had four stock based compensation plans available for future grants 
prior to january   these plans are accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
during the first quarter of  we began expensing stock options as required under sfas no 
r  share based payments 
stock based compensation represents the cost related to stock based awards granted to employees 
we measure stock based compensation cost at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and recognize the cost as expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee s requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the expense is recorded in cost of revenues and sg a in the consolidated statement of operations based on the employees respective functions 
we record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction 
differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are recorded in additional paid in capital if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the consolidated statement of earnings if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid in capital exists from previous awards 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which will become effective in sfas no 
permits entities to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
we will adopt this statement in fiscal year and will determine whether we will elect the fair value option for any of our eligible financial instruments and other items 
we do not expect this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
while the statement is effective in the first fiscal quarter of  the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation with respect to other nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
the statement has new provisions regarding the measurement date as well as certain disclosure requirements 
effective december   sfas no 
will require us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations at fiscal year end 
we currently perform this measurement at september of each year 
in addition  beginning in fourth quarter of  this standard required that we eliminate the use of a three month lag period when recognizing the impact of curtailments or settlements and instead  recognize these amounts in the period in which they occur 
the provisions of sfas no 
do not permit retrospective application 
we expect to incur between million and million as an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of the remainder of this statement 
in september  the eitf issued eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements eitf  which will become effective in the task force concluded that an employer should recognize a liability for future benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions or opinion  classification and disclosure of allowances disclosure of depreciable assets and depreciation deferred compensation contracts capital changes convertible debt and debt issued with stock warrants amortization of debt discount and expense or premium based on the substantive agreement with the employee 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to result in a change to our accounting policy or have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which was effective for all business acquisitions with an acquisition date on or after january  this statement generally requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  contingent purchase consideration  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  at fair value on the date of acquisition

you are encouraged to review the risk factors portion of item a of part i of this filing which discusses the risk factors associated with our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our short term and long term borrowings and to foreign exchange rate risk with respect to our foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
interest rates as of december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of million in fixed rate debentures that mature in march and have an interest rate of 
the fair value of the fixed rate debentures on december   as determined based on recent market trades  was million 
see discussions of our credit facilities under the heading liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report and in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange rates due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to changing currency exchange rates by entering into short term currency exchange contracts 
we do not enter into any currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
contracts that effectively meet risk reduction and correlation criteria are accounted for as hedges  and accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are deferred in the cost basis of the underlying transaction 
in those circumstances when it is not appropriate to account for contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded currently in earnings 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in currency exchange rates applied to the exposure described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that if our hedges of exchange exposure were not in place  such market movements would have an impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ significantly from that analysis  however  based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedging activities 
during  our sales comprised million  or  denominated in us dollars  million  or  denominated in euros  million  or  denominated in british pounds  and million  or denominated in other foreign currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates positively impacted our sales by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively
