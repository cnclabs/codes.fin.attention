you should review these risk factors for a more complete understanding of the risks associated with an investment in our securities 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a provider of communications networking equipment  software and services that support the transport  switching  aggregation and management of voice  video and data traffic 
our optical service delivery and carrier ethernet service delivery products are used  individually or as part of an integrated solution  in networks operated by communications service providers  cable operators  governments and enterprises around the globe 
we are a network specialist targeting the transition of disparate  legacy communications networks to converged  next generation architectures  better able to handle increased traffic and to deliver more efficiently a broader mix of high bandwidth communications services 
our products  along with our service aware operating system and unified service and transport management enable service providers to efficiently and cost effectively deliver critical enterprise and consumer oriented communication services 
together with our professional support and consulting services  our product offering seeks to address holistically the business and network needs of our customers 
by improving network productivity  reducing operating costs and enabling new and integrated service offerings  we create business and operational value for our customers 
effect of recent market conditions and uncertain macroeconomic environment on our business through the first nine months of fiscal  our financial performance continued to be strong 
we achieved meaningful sequential quarterly revenue growth during this period and revenue was up over the first nine months of fiscal income from operations increased from million in the first nine months of fiscal to million for the first nine months of fiscal during the second half of  however  our business began to experience the effects of worsening macroeconomic conditions  further exacerbated by customer specific challenges and significant disruptions in the financial and credit markets globally 
we initially experienced order delays  lengthening sales cycles and slowing deployments  principally among our largest service provider customers in north america and europe 
as economic conditions worsened globally  these effects on our business spread across our industry into other customer segments and geographies 
revenue was million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing a sequential decrease from the third quarter and a decrease from our results in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also suffered a million loss from operations during the fourth quarter of significant uncertainty around current macroeconomic and industry conditions persists  particularly the effect these conditions and any sustained lack of liquidity in the capital markets may have upon the capital spending of our largest customers 
moreover  we are uncertain of the impact of any near term change of enterprise and consumer spending and behavior  in response to these market conditions  may have on the spending or financial position of our customers 
the level of competition we face during periods of economic weakness can be expected to increase 
we can not be certain how long these conditions will continue and the magnitude of their effects on our business and results of operations 
consequently  these conditions have negatively affected visibility of our business and made our forecasting and planning more difficult 
while we expect the near term market conditions to be challenging  we continue to believe in our longer term market opportunities 
we believe growing consumer and enterprise use  and increased dependence upon  high bandwidth applications and services  will require our customers to continue to invest in their networks and transition to more efficient  robust and economical network architectures 
as a result  we intend to continue to invest in our business  prioritizing spending related to product development and sales efforts 
during this period of uncertainty  we intend to balance our strategy of continued investment for the long term and manage our workforce and operating costs carefully to ensure that they are aligned with our business and market opportunities 
to that end  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we effected a targeted headcount reduction of employees 
this headcount reduction resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately million  principally associated with severance costs 
acquisition of world wide packets on march   we completed our acquisition of world wide packets  inc wwp  a provider of communications network equipment that enables the cost effective delivery of a variety of carrier ethernet based services  including business ethernet services  internet access  video conferencing and voip 
wwp s service delivery and aggregation switches support the access and aggregation tiers of communications networks and are typically deployed in metro and access networks 
through our acquisition of wwp  we expanded our ethernet offering beyond infrastructure to include service delivery capability and enhanced our embedded and management software suites 
we believe that this transaction will improve our time to market with carrier ethernet products and allow us to reach new customers and market segments  while strengthening and diversifying our position within existing customer networks 
we also believe that the service delivery switching and aggregation technology acquired through this acquisition will enable us to penetrate additional application segments  including ethernet business services  mobile backhaul for g wireless networks  and ethernet infrastructure for high bandwidth services such as iptv and triple play 
as a result of this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets 
we are amortizing the other intangible assets over their useful lives 
see critical accounting policies and estimates goodwill and long lived assets excluding goodwill below for information relating to these items and our test for impairment 
under purchase accounting rules  we revalued the acquired wwp finished goods inventory to fair value at the time of the acquisition 
this revaluation increased the marketable inventory carrying value by approximately million above wwp s original cost  of which we recognized million in the second quarter of fiscal and million in the third quarter of fiscal  as an increase in cost of goods sold 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for additional information related to this acquisition 
financial results for fiscal and financial position we generated revenue of million  representing a increase from fiscal revenue of million 
results for fiscal include revenue from our acquisition of wwp  which closed during the second quarter 
optical service delivery product sales increased million  reflecting a million increase in sales of cn flexselect advanced service platform and a million increase in sales of our core switching products 
fiscal revenue growth also benefited from an increase in service revenue 
our percentage of international revenue increased from million  or of total revenue in fiscal  to million  or of total revenue in fiscal for fiscal  two customers each accounted for greater than of our revenue and in the aggregate 
at t represented and bt represented of total revenue 
a small number of service providers continues to represent a large portion of our revenue 
our concentration of revenue has been affected in recent years by consolidation among communications service providers  including several of our largest customers 
while we believe this illustrates our success in leveraging our incumbent position within service provider networks  the resulting concentration of revenue increases our risk of quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results 
our concentration in revenue can exacerbate our exposure to reductions in spending or changes in network strategy involving one or more of our significant customers 
gross margin for fiscal was  up from in fiscal product gross margin was in fiscal  up from in fiscal gross margin improvement during fiscal reflects the effect of favorable product and customer mix  including increased sales of our core switching products  and a significant improvement in our services gross margin 
gross margin benefited from significant product cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies as a result of supply chain consolidation efforts and our increased use of lower cost contract manufacturers and suppliers in asia 
gross margin continues to be susceptible to quarterly fluctuation due to a number of factors  including product and customer mix during the period  our ability to drive product cost reductions  the level of pricing pressure we encounter  the effect of our services gross margin  the introduction of new products or entry into new markets  charges for excess and obsolete inventory and changes in warranty costs 
part of our strategy is to maintain the product gross margin improvements made in recent years by focusing our development and sale efforts on ethernet based  software intensive products that enable the flexible  cost effective delivery of higher value communications services 
operating expense increased from in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue from to  respectively 
increased operating expense reflects the addition of the wwp operations during the second quarter of fiscal and higher employee costs associated with headcount growth 
increased operating expense also reflects the expansion and acceleration of research and development initiatives that add features and functionality to our optical service delivery products and extend our portfolio of carrier ethernet service delivery products to increase our addressable market 
income from operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue 
net income decreased from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal  to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decrease in net income for fiscal reflects the reduction in operating income as well as a million decrease in interest and other income  net  which was a significant component of our net income in fiscal interest income decreased significantly during fiscal as a result of our repayment at maturity of the remaining principal balance of million on our convertible notes during the first quarter of fiscal and our payment  during the second quarter  of approximately million in cash consideration for our acquisition of wwp 
lower cash balances resulting from these payments  together with lower interest rates  were the principal cause of our net income reduction 
this decline was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense over this same period 
we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal cash from operations during fiscal consisted of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and a million net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital 
cash from operations during fiscal consisted of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and a million net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital 
at october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term and long term investments in marketable debt securities 
during fiscal and  we recognized a million and million loss  respectively  relating to our commercial paper investments in rhinebridge llc and siv portfolio plc formerly known as cheyne finance plc 
see critical accounting policies and estimates investments below for information relating to our losses associated with our investment in commercial paper issued by these two structured investment vehicles sivs 
during fiscal  we received final payment in connection with the completion of restructuring activities related to these sivs and we no longer hold these investments 
as of october   headcount was  an increase from  at october  and  at october  results of operations our results of operations for the fiscal include the operations of world wide packets beginning on march   the effective date of the acquisition 
revenue we derive revenue from sales of our products and services  which we discuss in the following three major groupings optical service delivery 
included in product revenue  this revenue grouping reflects sales of our transport and switching products and legacy data networking products and related software 
this revenue grouping was previously referred to as our converged ethernet infrastructure products 
carrier ethernet service delivery 
included in product revenue  this revenue grouping reflects sales of our service delivery and aggregation switches acquired from wwp  ethernet access products  broadband access products  and the related software 
global network services 
included in global network services revenue are sales of services  including installation  deployment  maintenance support and training activities 
a sizable portion of our revenue comes from sales to a small number of service providers for large communication network builds 
these projects are generally characterized by large and sporadic equipment orders and contract terms that can result in the recognition or deferral of significant amounts of revenue in a given quarter 
as a result  the nature of our business exposes us to the likelihood of quarterly fluctuation in revenue 
the level of demand for our products  the timing and size of equipment orders  our ability to deliver products to fulfill those orders  and the timing of product acceptance for revenue recognition all contribute to and can cause significant fluctuations in our revenue and operating results on a quarterly basis 
cost of goods sold product cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  component costs  direct compensation costs and overhead associated with manufacturing related operations  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  amortization of intangible assets and cost of excess and obsolete inventory 
services cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third party costs associated with provision of services including installation  deployment  maintenance support and training activities 
operating expense research and development expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense  including share based compensation expense  prototype costs relating to design  development  testing of our products and third party consulting costs

increased optical service delivery revenue reflects a million increase in sales of our cn flexselect advanced service platform and a million increase in sales of core switching products 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in core transport revenue and million decrease in our legacy metro and data networking products 
we believe that our optical service delivery revenue during fiscal benefited from increasing network capacity requirements and customer transition to more efficient and economical network architectures 
in particular  sales of our core switching products have benefited from an expansion in mesh style optical networks 
revenue from our carrier ethernet service delivery products increased by million  reflecting the addition of million in sales related to service delivery and aggregation switches from our acquisition of wwp 
this increase offset a million reduction in revenue from our broadband access products 
services revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in deployment services sales and million increase in maintenance and support services  reflecting higher sales volume and increased installation activity 
united states revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in sales of optical service delivery products 
increased optical service delivery revenue reflects a million increase in sales of cn and a million increase in sales of core switching products 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in core transport revenue and a million decrease in sales of legacy metro and data networking products

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased due to significant improvements in services gross margin  product cost reductions and favorable product mix 
gross profit on products as a percentage of product revenue increased primarily due to significant product cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies as a result of consolidation efforts relating to our supply chain and our increased use of lower cost contract manufacturers and suppliers in asia 
gross margin also benefited from a favorable product mix during fiscal this gross margin improvement was partially offset by the effect on product costs of goods sold of million in costs related to the revaluation of the acquired wwp inventory  as described in overview above  and million in amortization of intangible assets costs relating to the acquisition of wwp 
gross profit on services as a percentage of services revenue increased significantly during fiscal due to improved deployment efficiencies

by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
some of our communications networking equipment is integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
accordingly  we account for revenue from such equipment in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
sop incorporates additional guidance unique to software arrangements incorporated with general accounting guidance  such as  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and software 
if multiple element arrangements include software or software related elements that are essential to the equipment  we apply the provisions of sop to determine the amount of the arrangement fee to be allocated to those separate units of accounting 
multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered element s is not dependent on the undelivered element s  there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element s  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element s have been met 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for all other deliverables  we apply the provisions of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf allows for separation of elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element s  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially within our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element s 
the revenue recognition criteria described above are applied to each separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  share based payments  as interpreted by sab sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
because we considered our options to be plain vanilla  we calculated the expected term using the simplified method as prescribed in sab for fiscal under sab  options are considered to be plain vanilla if they have the following basic characteristics they are granted at the money  exercisability is conditioned upon service through the vesting date  termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture  there is a limited exercise period following termination of service  and the options are non transferable and non hedgeable 
beginning in fiscal  as prescribed by sab  we gathered more detailed historical information about specific exercise behavior of our grantees  which we used to determine expected term 
we considered the implied volatility and historical volatility of our stock price in determining our expected volatility  and  finding both to be equally reliable  determined that a combination of both measures would result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
we recognize the estimated fair value of option based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to share based compensation and the amount of share based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of october   total unrecognized compensation expense was i million  which relates to unvested stock options and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  and ii million  which relates to unvested restricted stock units and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock units directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law with and without method 
under the with and without method  the windfall is considered realized and recognized for financial statement purposes only when an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax benefits including our net operating losses 
the with and without method results in the windfall from share based compensation awards always being effectively the last tax benefit to be considered 
consequently  the windfall attributable to share based compensation will not be considered realized in instances where our net operating loss carryover that is unrelated to windfalls is sufficient to offset the current year s taxable income before considering the effects of current year windfalls 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these charges were primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted product sales 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to the risk that our customers will not order products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
if actual market conditions worsen or differ from those we have assumed  if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there is a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to a rapid change in technology  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
our inventory net of allowance for excess and obsolete was million and as of october  and october   respectively 
restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the fair value of the minimum future lease payments under our contracted lease obligations  offset by the fair value of the estimated sublease payments that we may receive 
as of october   our accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
the total minimum lease payments for these restructured facilities are million 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of our leases  which range from sixteen months to ten years 
if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we will be required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management s assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectibility 
in doing so  we consider creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer s financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was million and as of october  and october   respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of october  and october  was million 
goodwill as of october  and october   our consolidated balance sheet included million and million in goodwill  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from our acquisitions 
the increase above reflects goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of world wide packets during the second quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information related to the allocation of the purchase price 
in accordance with sfas  we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  which we have determined to be the last business day of fiscal september each year 
we also test our goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas requires a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we determine the fair value of our single reporting unit to be equal to our market capitalization plus a control premium 
market capitalization is determined by multiplying the shares outstanding on the assessment date by the average market price of our common stock over a day period before and a day period after each assessment date 
we use this day duration to consider inherent market fluctuations that may affect any individual closing price 
we believe that our market capitalization alone does not fully capture the fair value of our business as a whole  or the substantial value that an acquirer would obtain from its ability to obtain control of our business 
as such  in determining fair value  we add a control premium which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be required to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies  direct operations and make decisions related to our company to our market capitalization 
no goodwill impairment loss was recorded in fiscal or in fiscal for fiscal and  we performed the step one fair value comparison as of september  and september  respectively 
for fiscal  our market capitalization  calculated as described above  was billion and our carrying value  including goodwill  was million 
because market capitalization significantly exceeded our carrying value  our estimate of the control premium was not a determining factor in the outcome of step one of the impairment assessment 
for fiscal  our market capitalization had fallen to million and our carrying value  including goodwill  had increased to million 
we applied a control premium to market capitalization to determine a fair value of billion 
we believe that including a control premium at this level is supported by recent transaction data in our industry 
but for the inclusion of a control premium greater than for fiscal  our carrying value would have exceeded fair value  requiring a step two analysis which may have resulted in an impairment of goodwill 
as evidenced above  our stock price and control premium are significant factors in assessing our fair value for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment 
our stock price can be affected by  among other things  changes in industry or market conditions  changes in our results of operations  and changes in our forecasts or market expectations relating to future results 
significant turmoil in the financial markets and weakness in macroeconomic conditions globally have recently contributed to volatility in our stock price and a significant decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of fiscal our stock price has fluctuated from a high of to a low of during the fourth quarter of fiscal on numerous occasions during the fourth quarter  our stock price was high enough that our market capitalization exceeded our carrying value without giving effect to a control premium 
the current macroeconomic environment  however  continues to be challenging and we cannot be certain of the duration of these conditions and their potential impact on our stock price performance 
if our recent stock price decline persists and our market capitalization remains below our carrying value for a sustained period  it is reasonably likely that a goodwill impairment assessment prior to the next annual review in the fourth quarter of fiscal would be necessary and an impairment of goodwill may be recorded 
a non cash goodwill impairment charge would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
if we are required to take a substantial impairment charge  our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period 
long lived assets excluding goodwill our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  include equipment  furniture and fixtures  finite lived intangible assets  and maintenance spares 
as of october  and these assets totaled million and million  net  respectively 
we account for the impairment or disposal of these long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas in accordance with sfas  we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
our long lived assets are part of a single reporting unit which represents the lowest level for which we identify cash flows 
due to effects on our business of worsening macroeconomic conditions  further exacerbated by significant disruptions in the financial and credit markets globally  we have recently experienced order delays  lengthening sales cycles and slowing deployments 
as a result of these conditions  we performed an impairment analysis of all our long lived assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal valuation of our long lived assets requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and sales volumes for our products that involve new technologies and uncertainties around customer acceptance of new products 
these and other assumptions are used to forecast future  undiscounted cash flows 
based on our estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows as of october   no impairment was required 
if actual market conditions differ or our forecasts change  we may be required to record a non cash impairment charge related to long lived assets in future periods 
such charges would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
investments we have an investment portfolio comprised of marketable debt securities including short term commercial paper  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  asset backed obligations and us government obligations 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize losses when we determine that declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if we judge that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current fair value  and we would incur a loss equal to the decline  which could materially adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that declines in the estimated fair value of our investments in certain commercial paper were other than temporary 
this commercial paper was issued by siv portfolio plc formerly known as cheyne finance plc and rhinebridge llc  two structured investment vehicles sivs that entered into receivership during the fourth quarter of fiscal and failed to make payment at maturity 
due to its mortgage related assets  these sivs were exposed to adverse market conditions that affected the value of its collateral and its ability to access short term funding 
we purchased these investments in the third quarter of fiscal and  at the time of purchase  each investment had a rating of a by standard and poor s and p by moody s  their highest ratings respectively 
at the end of fiscal  these investments were no longer trading and had no readily determinable market value 
we reviewed current investment ratings  valuation estimates of the underlying collateral  company specific news and events  and general economic conditions in considering the fair value of these investments at the end of fiscal in estimating fair value  we used a valuation approach based on a liquidation of assets held by each siv and their subsequent distribution of cash 
we utilized assessments of the underlying collateral from multiple indicators of value  which were then discounted to reflect the expected timing of disposition and market risks 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of october   we recognized losses of million related to these investments 
giving effect to these losses  our investment portfolio at october  included an estimated fair value of million in commercial paper issued by these entities 
during fiscal  we recognized additional losses of million related to these investments  received payments of totaling million in connection with the restructuring of these sivs  and  as of the end of the fiscal year  no longer hold these investments 
as of october   our minority investments in privately held technology companies  reported in other assets  were million 
these investments are generally carried at cost because we own less than of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over any of these companies 
these investments are inherently high risk 
the markets for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of our investment and such markets may never materialize or become significant 
we could lose our entire investment in some or all of these companies 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary 
if market conditions  the expected financial performance  or the competitive position of the companies in which we invest deteriorate  we may be required to record a non cash charge in future periods due to impairment in their value 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance fully offsetting our gross deferred tax assets of billion 
we calculated the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets  when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal 
based on our recent historical results and forecast  prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  management believed it was reasonably likely that there would be sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of our valuation allowance at the end of fiscal due to our most recent quarterly loss  the uncertain macroeconomic environment  and limited visibility into our future results  management does not believe such sufficient positive evidence exists as of october  and determined to maintain a full valuation allowance 
we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
any release of valuation allowance may be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income  an adjustment to acquisition intangibles  or an adjustment to paid in capital  based on tax ordering requirements 
warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million and million as of october  and october   respectively 
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying these warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
uncertain tax positions effective at the beginning of the first quarter of  we adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which changes accounting for income taxes 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we reduced the liability for net unrecognized tax benefits by million  and accounted for the reduction as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that resulted in an increase to retained earnings of million and a decrease to income tax payable of million 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as of october   we had million in uncertain tax positions recorded as income tax payable 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  in accordance with fin  we reclassified these amounts to other long term obligations on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   we had million recorded as other long term obligations related to uncertain tax positions 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business 
these may relate to disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
a loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
unaudited quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results represented by certain items in our statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term and long term investment portfolio 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to the fair value of these investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated operating expense in canada  united kingdom  the european union and india 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense was us dollar denominated 
as of october   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on our financial position 
to date  we have not hedged against foreign currency fluctuations 
due to the recent  significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we are considering and may pursue hedging strategies in fiscal
