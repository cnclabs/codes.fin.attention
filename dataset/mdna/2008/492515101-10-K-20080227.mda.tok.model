item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
employees as of february   we had full and part time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties 
if any of the following occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed 
these factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the future and may never become profitable 
we have a limited operating history 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies 
in addition  we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as we expand our research and development efforts  we will incur increasing losses 
we may continue to incur substantial operating losses even if we begin to generate revenues from our drug candidates 
we have not yet commercialized any of our drug candidates and cannot be sure we will ever be able to do so 
even if we commercialize one or more of our drug candidates  we may not become profitable 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors  including our ability to complete our development efforts  obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates  successfully complete any post approval regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize our drug candidates 
risks associated with our product development efforts if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trial programs  or if such clinical trials take longer to complete than we project  our ability to execute our current business strategy will be adversely affected 
whether or not and how quickly we complete clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate at which we are able to engage clinical trial sites and  thereafter  the rate of enrollment of patients  and the rate we collect  clean  lock and analyze the clinical trial database 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and whether existing or new drugs are approved for the indication we are studying 
we are aware that other companies are planning clinical trials that will seek to enroll patients with the same diseases as we are studying 
in addition  one of our current trials for sulonex is designed to continue until a pre determined number of events have occurred to the patients enrolled 
trials such as this are subject to delays stemming from patient withdrawal and from lower than expected event rates and may also incur increased costs if enrollment is increased in order to achieve the desired number of events 
if we experience delays in identifying and contracting with sites and or in patient enrollment in our clinical trial programs  we may incur additional costs and delays in our development programs  and may not be able to complete our clinical trials on a cost effective or timely basis 
in addition  conducting multi national studies adds another level of complexity and risk as we are subject to events affecting countries outside the united states 
additionally  we have finalized an spa agreement with the fda for the phase and phase clinical trials of sulonex 
the clinical plan to support a new drug application  or nda  approval for sulonex under subpart h  as agreed upon with the fda under an spa  consists of i a single phase trial in patients with microalbuminuria based on the surrogate marker of regression of microalbuminuria as the primary endpoint  ii supportive data from previously conducted clinical studies  and iii substantial recruitment into our phase confirmatory study that will measure clinical outcomes in patients with overt nephropathy  or macroalbuminuria 
the subpart h process is complex and requires careful execution 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to meet the requirements set forth in the spa 
even if we meet those requirements  the fda is not obligated to grant approval of our nda for sulonex 
many companies who have been granted an spa and or the right to utilize an accelerated approval approach have failed to obtain approval 
since we are seeking accelerated approval under an spa  we may be subject to enhanced scrutiny 
additionally  even if the primary endpoint is achieved  an spa does not guarantee approval 
the fda may raise issues of safety  study conduct  changes in scientific or medical evidence or sentiment or internal inconsistency in the data prior to making their final decision 
the fda may also seek the guidance of an advisory panel prior to making their final decision 
in addition  the fda will have access to  and will review  the safety database for our phase clinical trial prior to granting approval 
any concerns arising from that review could delay or prevent the approval of sulonex 
if the fda approves sulonex for marketing on the basis of our phase trial  our phase clinical trial may yield insufficient efficacy data or give rise to safety concerns  which could result in withdrawal of such approval or could cause us to withdraw the product from the market 
moreover  negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we hope to conduct or adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials 
accordingly  we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame  if at all 
additionally  we have never filed an nda or similar application for approval in the united states or in any country  which may result in a delay in  or the rejection of  our filing of an nda or similar application 
during the drug development process  regulatory agencies will typically ask questions of drug sponsors 
while we endeavor to answer all such questions in a timely fashion  or in the nda filing  some questions may not be answered by the time we file our nda 
unless the fda waives the requirement to answer any such unanswered questions  our nda may be delayed or rejected 
for example  with respect to sulonex  during the development process  the fda has raised certain non clinical questions 
to answer some of these questions requires a bioassay for which the analytical tools do not currently exist 
the fda has requested that we diligently pursue such an assay 
we believe that we have diligently pursued  and will continue to diligently pursue  such an assay 
if the fda determines that we have not been diligent  or otherwise determines that our nda fails to answer required questions  then our nda could be delayed or rejected 
in addition  nda approval can be delayed or denied due to unanswered questions relating to chemistry  manufacturing and controls 
our ability to resolve any such open questions might be complicated by the recent investigations into heparin manufacturing in china 
all of those factors could affect the filing or ultimate approvability of sulonex 
failure to obtain approval on a timely basis  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on us 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
if our drug candidates do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates 
we have not received  and may never receive  regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our drug candidates 
we will need to conduct significant additional research and human testing before we can apply for product approval with the fda or with regulatory authorities of other countries 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically depends on the nature  complexity and novelty of the product and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical tests can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
it may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidates and failure can occur at any stage of this process 
negative or inconclusive results or medical events during a clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts 
furthermore  interim results of preclinical or clinical studies do not necessarily predict their final results  and acceptable results in early studies might not be obtained in later studies 
drug candidates in the later stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite positive results in initial clinical testing 
there can be no assurance that the results from the sulonex phase study will track the data from the pilot collaborative study group phase study or the dinas phase study  or that the results from the sulonex phase study will yield sufficient efficacy data 
results from these earlier sulonex studies may not be indicative of results from future clinical trials and the risk remains that the pivotal program for sulonex may generate efficacy data that will be insufficient for the approval of the drug  or may raise safety concerns that may prevent approval of the drug 
interpretation of the prior safety and efficacy data of sulonex  or our other drug candidates  may be flawed and there can be no assurance that safety and or efficacy concerns from the prior data were overlooked or misinterpreted  which in subsequent  larger studies appear and prevents approval of sulonex or our other drugs candidates 
clinical trials have a high risk of failure 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving what appeared to be promising results in earlier trials 
if we experience delays in the testing or approval process or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than originally planned  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be materially impaired 
in addition  we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the united states and abroad and  accordingly  may encounter unforeseen problems and delays in the approval process 
while we have engaged a clinical research organization with experience in conducting regulatory trials  errors in the conduct  monitoring and or auditing could invalidate the results from a regulatory perspective 
because all of our proprietary technologies are licensed to us by third parties  termination of these license agreements would prevent us from developing our drug candidates 
we do not own any of our drug candidates 
we have licensed the rights  patent or otherwise  to our drugs candidates from third parties 
these license agreements require us to meet development milestones and impose development and commercialization due diligence requirements on us 
in addition  under these agreements  we must pay royalties on sales of products resulting from licensed technologies and pay the patent filing  prosecution and maintenance costs related to the licenses 
if we do not meet our obligations in a timely manner or if we otherwise breach the terms of our license agreements  our licensors could terminate the agreements  and we would lose the rights to our drug candidates 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may have disagreements with our licensors or collaborators regarding the terms of our agreements or ownership of proprietary rights  which could lead to delays in the research  development and commercialization of our drug candidates or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
we rely on third parties to manufacture and test our products 
if these third parties do not successfully manufacture and test our products  our business will be harmed 
we have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes 
we intend to continue  in whole or in part  to use third parties to manufacture and test our products for use in clinical trials and for future sales 
we may not be able to enter into future contract agreements with these third parties on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  shortage of qualified personnel  compliance with fda and foreign regulations  production costs and development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
our third party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required by us to successfully produce and market our drug candidates 
in addition  our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding foreign governmental agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices as well as other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
the same issues apply to contract analytical services which we use for testing of our products 
we will not have control over  other than by contract and periodic oversight  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
switching or engaging multiple third party contractors to produce our products may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited  particularly in the case of sulonex  and the process by which multiple manufacturers make the drug substance must be identical at each manufacturing facility 
it may be difficult for us to find and engage replacement or multiple manufacturers quickly and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
moreover  if we need to change manufacturers  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance  which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with fda and foreign regulations and standards 
if third party manufacturers fail to deliver the required quantities of our drug candidates on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices  we will not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
we have entered into a relationship with spl  a us based contract manufacturer  to manufacture sulonex which we believe will be adequate to satisfy our current clinical trial and early commercial market needs 
manufacture will be conducted in a manufacturing suite built within their current facility by keryx  which they will operate on our behalf 
we believe this suite will be suitable to manufacture launch and initial commercialization to years quantities of sulonex 
this new manufacturing suite has been completed and facility validation is in progress  with expected completion in as we move forward  we plan to build additional manufacturing capacity to meet the future demands for sulonex and create back up manufacturing capabilities 
as with all heparin like compounds  the end product is sensitive to the manufacturing process utilized 
accordingly  as we scale up we will need to accurately reproduce the established process on the larger scale to ensure successful commercialization of sulonex 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this endeavor 
in addition  because we do not have a bioassay for sulonex  we may have difficulty qualifying materials from multiple sources  including materials produced from our larger scale facility and or from additional facilities  which could delay or impair our commercialization efforts 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital expenditures to develop commercial production capacity 
through december   we have spent approximately million in capital expenditures building the current manufacturing suite 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for sulonex  we may incur significant losses disposing of the assets associated with our manufacturing suite 
if we are not able to obtain the raw materials required for the manufacture of our lead product candidate  sulonex  our ability to develop and market this product candidate will be substantially harmed 
key raw materials for sulonex  our lead product candidate  are derived from porcine mucosa 
long term supplies for sulonex could be affected by factors over which we have no control  for example  limitations in the supply of porcine mucosa and the demand for other heparin products 
we estimate  in part  based on the number of pigs killed worldwide and estimates of projected supplies of porcine mucosa  that there is enough potential supply of this raw material to commercialize sulonex 
if our estimates of the potential supply of this key raw material are not accurate or we cannot secure adequate amounts of the potential supply of such material  then the market potential of sulonex will not be realized 
diseases affecting the world supply of pigs  or safety issues associated with heparin products  generally  or specifically associated with heparin manufactured by our suppliers  including spl  could also have an actual or perceived negative impact on our ability  or the ability of our contract manufacturers  to source  make and or sell sulonex 
supply of heparin from china is important to all participants in the heparin business and  therefore  we are following closely the investigations into applicable controls and regulations in china to determine its impact  if any  on keryx and sulonex  or on our supplier  spl  which  in turn  could have an adverse effect on us 
if these investigations result in a reduction in the amount of porcine mucosa available from china  or any significant delay in obtaining those supplies  it could adversely affect the commercial success of sulonex 
if we do not establish or maintain manufacturing  drug development and marketing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to commercialize our products 
we do not possess all of the capabilities to fully commercialize our products on our own 
from time to time  we may need to contract with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  assist us in developing  testing and obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing some of our compounds and technologies  and market and distribute our drug products 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into agreements with such third parties on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully contract with third parties for these services when needed  or if existing arrangements for these services are terminated  whether or not through our actions  or if such third parties do not fully perform under these arrangements  we may have to delay  scale back or end one or more of our drug development programs or seek to develop or commercialize our products independently  which could result in delays 
furthermore  such failure could result in the termination of license rights to one or more of our products 
if these manufacturing  development or marketing agreements take the form of a partnership or strategic alliance  such arrangements may provide our collaborators with significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the development and commercialization of our products 
accordingly  to the extent that we rely on third parties to research  develop or commercialize our products  we are unable to control whether such products will be scientifically or commercially successful 
additionally  if these third parties fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform their work in a satisfactory manner  in spite of our efforts to monitor and ensure the quality of such work  we may face delays in achieving the regulatory milestones required for commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
our reliance on third parties  such as clinical research organizations  or cros  may result in delays in completing  or a failure to complete  clinical trials if they fail to perform under our agreements with them 
in the course of product development  we engage cros to conduct and manage clinical studies and to assist us in guiding our products through the fda review and approval process 
if the cros fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner  we may face delays in completing our clinical trials  as well as commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
furthermore  any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials and the market approval of drug candidates 
other risks related to our business if we are unable to develop adequate sales  marketing or distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform some of these functions  we will not be able to commercialize our products effectively 
in the event sulonex is approved by the fda  we currently plan to conduct our own sales and marketing effort to support the drug  and we may adopt this strategy with respect to future drug products 
we currently have limited experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
to directly market and distribute any products  we must build a sales and marketing organization with appropriate technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may attempt to build such a sales and marketing organization on our own or with the assistance of a contract sales organization 
for some market opportunities  we may need to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms in order to increase the commercial success of our products 
we may not be able to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities of our own or enter into such arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and some or all of the revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  and these efforts may not be successful 
additionally  building marketing and distribution capabilities may be more expensive than we anticipate  requiring us to divert capital from other intended purposes or preventing us from building our marketing and distribution capabilities to the desired levels 
notwithstanding our current plans to commercialize sulonex and our other drug candidates  from time to time we may consider offers or hold discussions with companies for partnerships or the acquisition of our company or any of our products 
any accepted offer may preclude us from the execution of our current business plan 
even if we obtain fda approval to market our drug products  if they fail to achieve market acceptance  we will never record meaningful revenues 
even if our products are approved for sale  they may not be commercially successful in the marketplace 
market acceptance of our drug products will depend on a number of factors  including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  the rates of adoption of our products by medical practitioners and the target populations for our products  the potential advantages that our products offer over existing treatment methods  the cost effectiveness of our products relative to competing products  the availability of government or third party payor reimbursement for our products  the side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or similar products  and the effectiveness of our sales  marketing and distribution efforts 
because we expect sales of our products  if approved  to generate substantially all of our revenues in the long term  the failure of our drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing or other sources of revenue 
if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug products  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and public and private research institutions 
in addition  companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us 
many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development  regulation  manufacturing and marketing than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel  attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations  and license technologies that are competitive with ours 
as a result  our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that could render our drug products obsolete or noncompetitive 
to compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors 
the drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies 
in addition  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug products 
other companies have drug candidates in various stages of pre clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to discover and develop drug products 
some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier 
even if we are successful in developing effective drugs  our products may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our operations could be disrupted and our business could be harmed 
as of february   we had full and part time employees 
to successfully develop our drug candidates  we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  if we lose the services of our current personnel  in particular  michael s 
weiss  our chairman and chief executive officer  our ability to continue to execute on our business plan could be materially impaired 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
weiss  this agreement does not prevent him from terminating his employment with us 
any acquisitions we make may require a significant amount of our available cash and may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
as part of our business strategy  we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses  products  technologies  capabilities and personnel 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
acquisitions involve a number of operational risks  including difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired business  our inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of the acquired business  our inability to maintain the acquired company s relationship with key third parties  such as alliance partners  exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition  the diversion of our management s attention from our core business  and the potential impairment of goodwill and write off of in process research and development costs  adversely affecting our reported results of operations 
the status of reimbursement from third party payors for newly approved health care drugs is uncertain and failure to obtain adequate reimbursement could limit our ability to generate revenue 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care programs  and other third party payors 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors  including medicare  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted labeling approval 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for our products 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  their market acceptance may be reduced 
in particular  we are currently projecting that the price of sulonex will be at a significant premium to the currently marketed products that are approved for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy 
the inability to obtain adequate reimbursement for sulonex would limit our ability to generate revenue and prevent us from realizing the market potential of sulonex 
health care reform measures could adversely affect our business 
the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system  such as proposals relating to the reimportation of drugs into the us from other countries where they are then sold at a lower price and government control of prescription drug pricing 
the pendency or approval of such proposals could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic partnerships or licenses 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the use of our drug candidates in clinical trials  the future sale of any approved drug candidates and new technologies  and the sale of accumin  exposes us to liability claims 
although we are not aware of any historical or anticipated product liability claims against us  if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to cease clinical trials of our drug candidates or limit commercialization of any approved products 
we believe that we have obtained sufficient product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of accumin 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the commercial sale of any approved products if marketing approval is obtained  however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost 
we also may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage that will be adequate to cover product liability risks that may arise 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  our inability to continue to develop a drug candidate  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  and loss of revenues 
consequently  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
in connection with providing our clinical trial management and site recruitment services  we may be exposed to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the online collaborative oncology group  inc  or ocog  a subsidiary we acquired through our acquisition of access oncology  provides clinical trial management and site recruitment services to us as well as other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
in conducting the activities of ocog  any failure on our part to comply with applicable governmental regulations or contractual obligations could expose us to liability to our clients and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform 
in addition  the wrongful or erroneous delivery of health care information or services may expose us to liability 
if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any such claims  the losses could be material 
our corporate compliance efforts cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
the development  manufacturing  pricing  sales  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and other authorities within the united states and numerous entities outside of the united states 
we are a relatively small company with full and part time employees 
we also have significantly fewer employees than many other companies that have a product candidate in late stage clinical development  and we rely heavily on third parties to conduct many important functions 
while we believe that our corporate compliance program is sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable regulations  we cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  including suspension or termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of products from the market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
risks related to our financial condition our current cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and investment securities may not be adequate to support our operations for the length of time that we have estimated 
we believe that our million in cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and investment securities as of december  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs and capital expenditures through the date of the release of our phase sulonex data  expected in the first quarter of depending on the outcome of our phase study  our cash requirements will vary dramatically 
in the event of a negative outcome  we believe our current capital resources will enable us to meet our revised operating needs and capital expenditures for at least months from january our forecast of the period of time through which our cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable  and investment securities will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the timing of completion and results from clinical trials for our drug candidates  especially sulonex  the timing of expenses associated with manufacturing and product development of the proprietary drug candidates within our portfolio and those that may be in licensed  partnered or acquired  the timing of the in licensing  partnering and acquisition of new product opportunities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered  or may enter  into research and development agreements  our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangements  and the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
as of february   million of our investment securities are invested in auction note securities 
our auction note securities are public securities with long term nominal maturities for which the interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each month 
the monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
our investments in auction note securities represent interests in student loan backed securities 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines  our auction note securities all had triple a credit ratings at the time of purchase 
global credit and capital markets are increasingly experiencing liquidity issues 
none of our auction note securities held at december   failed an auction in or  however  a million investment we made in january failed two auctions held in february  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
we will continue to attempt to sell this million investment security every seven days until an auction is successful 
our other million of investments in auction note securities have their next scheduled auction dates in march if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or we experience any ratings downgrades on the auction note securities in our portfolio  we may incur impairments to our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings  and the lack of liquidity of our auction note securities could have a material impact on our financial flexibility and ability to fund our operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us  or at all  our business would be harmed 
we expect to use  rather than generate  funds from operations for the foreseeable future 
based on our current plans  we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable  and investment securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements through the date of the release of our phase sulonex data  expected in the first quarter of depending on the outcome of our phase study  our cash requirements will vary dramatically 
in the event of a negative outcome  we believe our current capital resources will enable us to meet our revised operating needs and capital expenditures for at least months from january however  the actual amount of funds that we will need prior to or after that date will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we may need funds sooner or in different amounts than we currently anticipate  depending upon the timing of completion and results from clinical trials for our drug candidates  especially sulonex  the progress of our development activities  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our development programs  the costs associated with commercialization activities  including manufacturing  marketing and sales  our ability to establish and maintain current and new licensing or acquisition arrangements  our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangements  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of regulatory approvals 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all  we may be required to cease or reduce our operating activities or sell or license to third parties some or all of our intellectual property 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted 
if we need to raise additional funds through the sale or license of our intellectual property  we may be unable to do so on terms favorable to us 
our prior restructurings may result in additional israeli related liabilities 
in july  keryx israel ltd  one of our israeli subsidiaries  vacated its jerusalem facility  after giving advance notice to rmpa properties ltd  the landlord 
on may   the landlord filed suit in the circuit court of jerusalem in jerusalem  israel  claiming that keryx israel ltd  among other parties  was liable as a result of the alleged breach of the lease agreement 
in addition to keryx israel ltd  the landlord brought suit against keryx biomedical technologies ltd  another of our israeli subsidiaries  keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc  michael s 
weiss  our chairman and chief executive officer  and robert trachtenberg  a former employee of keryx 
the amount demanded by the landlord totals  new israeli shekels  or approximately  and includes rent for the entire remaining term of the lease  as well as property taxes and other costs allegedly incurred by the landlord 
in august  the landlord claimed a bank deposit  in the amount of  which was previously provided as security in connection with the lease agreement 
we intend to vigorously defend the suit 
in july  keryx israel ltd 
and keryx biomedical technologies ltd 
filed an answer to the landlord s complaint 
in october  keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc filed an answer to the landlord s complaint 
generally  each answer challenges the merits of the landlord s cause of action as to each defendant 
all defendants  except keryx israel ltd  have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
the plaintiff has filed a response to each answer 
at this time  the circuit court of jerusalem has not issued a decision with respect to the motion to dismiss 
a hearing on a motion by keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc to vacate service of process outside of israel was held in september on october   the circuit court of jerusalem held that the service of process on keryx was sustained 
we appealed this holding 
the appeal was denied on september   and we filed a petition for certiorari to the supreme court of israel 
our motion for certiorari was denied as well 
the next preliminary hearing is scheduled for february  we have not yet recorded a charge to reflect any potential liability associated with this lawsuit  as it is too early to accurately estimate the amount of the charge  if any 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  third parties may be able to use our intellectual property  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection on our drug products and technologies and successfully defend these patents against third party challenges 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date 
accordingly  the patents we use may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative drug products or technologies or design around our patented drug products and technologies 
the patents we use may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we require our employees  collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  this may not be sufficient to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  we share ownership and publication rights to data relating to some of our drug products and technologies with our research collaborators and scientific advisors 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of this information  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information will be at risk 
litigation or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money defending such claims and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
third parties may assert that we are using their proprietary intellectual property without authorization 
in addition  third parties may have or obtain patents in the future and claim that our drug products or technologies infringe their patents 
if we are required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties  or if we sue third parties to protect our patent rights  we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs  and our management s attention may be diverted from operating our business 
in addition  any legal action against our licensors or us that seeks damages or an injunction of our commercial activities relating to our drug products or technologies could subject us to monetary liability and require our licensors or us to obtain a license to continue to use our drug products or technologies 
we cannot predict whether our licensors or we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
risks related to our common stock future sales or other issuances of our common stock could depress the market for our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future 
on december   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s  that was declared effective by the sec on january   providing for the offering of up to million of our common stock 
following our registered direct offering of common stock to two institutional investors that was completed in march  there remains approximately million available for sale on this shelf registration statement 
future sales pursuant to this registration statement could depress the market for our common stock 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes stock or other securities  our stockholders may be significantly diluted 
we may be required to issue up to  shares of our common stock to former stockholders of access oncology upon the achievement of certain milestones  of which  shares may be payable in upon the reaching of the first milestone 
in addition  we may enter into arrangements with third parties permitting us to issue shares of common stock in lieu of certain cash payments upon the achievement of milestones 
our stock price can be volatile  which increases the risk of litigation  and may result in a significant decline in the value of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include developments concerning our drug candidates  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  introductions or announcements of new products by us or our competitors  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  expiration or termination of licenses  research contracts or other collaboration agreements  conditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  and additions or departures of key personnel 
in addition  equity markets in general  and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets 
these broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our development and operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
certain anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
this could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  or control us 
these factors could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of such holders 
in certain circumstances  such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock 
our amended and restated bylaws eliminate the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
any of these provisions could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control

item legal proceedings 
we  and our subsidiaries  are not a party to  and our property is not the subject of  any material pending legal proceedings  other than as noted below 
in july  keryx israel ltd  one of our israeli subsidiaries  vacated its jerusalem facility  after giving advance notice to rmpa properties ltd  the landlord 
on may   the landlord filed suit in the circuit court of jerusalem in jerusalem  israel  claiming that keryx israel ltd  among other parties  was liable as a result of the alleged breach of the lease agreement 
in addition to keryx israel ltd  the landlord brought suit against keryx biomedical technologies ltd  another of our israeli subsidiaries  keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc  michael s 
weiss  our chairman and chief executive officer  and robert trachtenberg  a former employee of keryx 
the amount demanded by the landlord totals  new israeli shekels  or approximately  and includes rent for the entire remaining term of the lease  as well as property taxes and other costs allegedly incurred by the landlord 
in august  the landlord claimed a bank deposit  in the amount of  which was previously provided as security in connection with the lease agreement 
we intend to vigorously defend the suit 
in july  keryx israel ltd 
and keryx biomedical technologies ltd 
filed an answer to the landlord s complaint 
in october  keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc filed an answer to the landlord s complaint 
generally  each answer challenges the merits of the landlord s cause of action as to each defendant 
all defendants  except keryx israel ltd  have filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
the plaintiff has filed a response to each answer 
at this time  the circuit court of jerusalem has not issued a decision with respect to the motion to dismiss 
a hearing on a motion by keryx biopharmaceuticals  inc and michael s 
weiss to vacate service of process outside of israel was held in june on october   the court held that the service of the claim against mr 
weiss is vacated 
consequently  the circuit court of jerusalem dismissed the suit against mr 
weiss 
however  the service against us was sustained 
we appealed this holding 
the appeal was denied on june   and we filed a petition for certiorari to the supreme court of israel 
our motion for certiorari was denied as well 
the next preliminary hearing is scheduled for february  we have not yet recorded a charge to reflect any potential liability associated with this lawsuit  as it is too early to accurately estimate the amount of the charge  if any 
we are engaged in an arbitration proceeding with alfa wasserman concerning certain terms of the license agreement related to the provision of data to alfa wasserman and consultation regarding management of the licensed patents 
an arbitration proceeding was held in october and we are awaiting decision from the arbitrator 
the outcome of the arbitration should not affect the validity of the license  but whether we are required to share data with alfa wasserman for that company s use outside of our licensed territories and our ongoing management of the licensed patent portfolio 
alfa wasserman also seeks unspecified damages 
if the arbitrator determines that we owe alfa wasserman the data  and that failure to deliver such data constitutes a material breach of the license agreement  then we will have days to cure such breach following the final arbitration decision by delivering any data required to be provided 
failure to cure would entitle alfa wasserman to terminate the license agreement 
in november  we initiated an action in the us district court for the southern district of new york against panion to enjoin panion from improperly terminating the november license agreement for an alleged breach of contract by keryx related to certain manufacturing provisions of the agreement  to enjoin panion from interfering with keryx s contractual relationships with certain third parties  as well as to enforce keryx s right with respect to the prosecution of certain patents 
on november   the court granted keryx s motion for a preliminary injunction 
panion has since asserted counterclaims for breach of contract relating to certain manufacturing provisions of the license agreement and the parties have reached a tentative agreement to settle the litigation 
if the parties are unable to resolve the matter by a settlement  we will proceed with the action to resolve the parties respective claims  in which event keryx will incur significant legal expenses 
the matter is currently scheduled for trial in the second half of in the event that keryx is found to be in breach of contract  it will have thirty days in which to cure such breach before panion can terminate the agreement based on the alleged breach
