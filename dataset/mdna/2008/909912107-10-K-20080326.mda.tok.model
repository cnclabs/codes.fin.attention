item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  which is incorporated by reference herein 
employees at march   the company employed approximately persons  approximately of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in february the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 
competition the company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional real estate brokers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts 
there are numerous regional and local commercial developers  real estate companies  financial institutions and other investors who compete with the company for the acquisition of properties and tenants 
the company s hotels compete with national  regional and local hotels in each of their geographic markets 
competition is based on a number of factors  most notably convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services and guest amenities offered  quality of customer service and the overall condition of the property 
the company competes with at least other companies in the sale of engineered products 
the company emphasizes product performance and service in connection with the sale of these products 
the principal competition faced by the company results from the sales price of the products sold by its competitors 
backlog the dollar value of unfilled orders of the company s engineered products segment was approximately million at both december  and although total backlog did not change  fluctuations within the components did occur principally due to growth in the company s knitted wire and transformer product lines  offset by a special project that was completed during the year 
it is anticipated that substantially all of the backlog will be filled in substantially all of the backlog was filled in the order backlog referred to above does not include any order backlog with respect to sales of knitted wire mesh components for exhaust emission control devices  exhaust seals or airbag components because of the manner in which customer orders are received 
environmental regulations federal  state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have had and will continue to have a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
it is the policy of the company to manage  operate and maintain its facilities in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable standards for the prevention  control and abatement of environmental pollution to prevent damage to the quality of air  land and resources 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith 
the process of remediation has begun at one facility pursuant to a plan filed with the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep 
environmental experts engaged by the company estimate that  under the most probable scenario  the remediation of this site is anticipated to require initial expenditures of  including the cost of capital equipment  and  in annual operating and maintenance costs over a year period 
environmental studies at the second facility indicate that remediation may be necessary 
based upon the facts presently available  environmental experts have advised the company that  under the most probable remediation scenario  the estimated cost to remediate this site is anticipated to require million in initial costs  including capital equipment expenditures  and  in annual operating and maintenance costs over a year period 
these estimated costs of future expenses for remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
the company may revise such estimates in the future due to the uncertainty regarding the nature  timing and extent of any remediation efforts that may be required at this site  should an appropriate regulatory agency deem such efforts to be necessary 
the foregoing estimates may also be revised by the company as new or additional information in these matters becomes available or should the njdep or other regulatory agencies require additional or alternative remediation efforts in the future 
although such events are not expected to change these estimates  adverse decisions or events  particularly as to the merits of the company s factual and legal basis  could cause the company to change its estimate of liability with respect to such matters in the future 
the company had approximately million and million recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities as of december  and  respectively  to cover such matters

risk factors the following are some of the risks that could cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by such statements our performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 
although the company s leases are generally long term and may be below market  real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid 
among the factors that may impact our real estate property values or the revenues derived from our portfolio are changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  the attractiveness of our properties to tenants  competition from other available property owners and changes in market rental rates 
our performance also depends on the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rent from tenants and to pay for adequate maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  which could increase over time 
also  the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
our results could be negatively affected by delinquencies in our mortgage or high yield loan receivables 
on a limited basis we provide high yield  short term mortgage loans that we believe are collateralized by desirable properties at substantial value to loan ratios 
in addition  we have provided purchase money notes to buyers of certain real estate properties 
although we believe that the collateral for these loans is sufficient to recover its carrying value  changes in the real estate market in the locale in which the property is located or delinquencies by the borrower could negatively affect our carrying value for these loans and  ultimately  our results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet obligations could deplete our liquidity and capital resources 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
the debt of the joint venture in which we currently have an ownership interest is a non recourse obligation and is collateralized by the entity s real property 
we believe that with each arrangement the value of the underlying property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy its obligations 
in addition  we are not obligated for the debts of the joint venture 
however  we could decide to satisfy the debts of the joint venture to protect our investment 
in such event  our capital resources and financial condition would be reduced and  in certain instances  the carrying value of our investment and our results of operations would be negatively impacted 
operating results of our hotel operations are subject to conditions common in the lodging industry 
changes in certain factors could adversely impact hotel room demand and pricing and result in reduced occupancy or could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
these factors include local conditions such as an oversupply of  or a reduction in demand for  hotel rooms  the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers and competition from other hotels  the quality  philosophy and performance of the managers of our hotels  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors such as increases in the price of energy  healthcare or insurance  changes in travel patterns  extreme weather conditions and cancellation of or changes in events scheduled to occur in our markets  seasonality  inherent in the hotel industry  may cause our results to fluctuate significantly between quarters  and other unpredictable external factors  such as acts of god  war  terrorist attacks  epidemics  airline strikes  transportation and fuel price increases and severe weather  may reduce business and leisure travel 
our engineered products segment relies on significant customers 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout the world 
historically  a small number of customers have accounted for significant portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by the engineered products segment to general motors  its largest customer  accounted for of the segment s sales 
since our engineered products segment accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  the loss of general motors as a customer  or a significant decline in sales to them  would adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  such sales could be negatively impacted in due to the effects of the continued softening of sales in the automotive industry 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our engineered products are highly competitive 
we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective than our own 
some of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution resources greater than ours 
an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the cost  of our raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
the principal raw materials used in the company s engineered products business are stainless steel wire  steel related products and copper  which are typically purchased from multiple suppliers throughout the world 
the price and availability of raw materials can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including general domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  supply and demand  competition  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
these factors could significantly affect the availability and cost of our raw materials which are generally purchased at levels that we believe will satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon contractual commitments  historical buying practices and market conditions 
we may be unable to recover raw material cost increases due to contractual or competitive conditions 
conversely  reductions in raw material prices could result in lower sales prices for our products and lower margins as we utilize existing inventories 
therefore  changing raw material costs could significantly impact our revenues  gross margins  operating and net income 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of stainless steel wire or other critical raw materials on a timely basis and at competitive prices  we may be unable to fulfill our customers requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement 
our engineered products business relies in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon the laws regarding unfair competition  restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we are not currently involved in any litigation regarding the infringement upon our intellectual property or regarding our infringement upon the intellectual property of others 
our operations are subject to environmental regulation and environmental problems which are possible and can be costly 
our engineered products segment is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products 
we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances at such property 
we have undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and have recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith see environmental regulations in item of part i and note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company may revise such estimates in the future due to the uncertainty regarding the nature  timing and extent of any remediation efforts that may be required at these sites  should an appropriate regulatory agency deem such efforts to be necessary 
the estimates may also be revised as new or additional information in these matters becomes available or should the njdep or other regulatory agencies require additional or alternative remediation efforts in the future 
although we do not expect such events to significantly change our estimates  adverse decisions or events  particularly as to the merits of our factual and legal basis  could cause us to change our estimate of liability with respect to such matters in the future 
accordingly  we are unable to predict whether our estimate of future remediation costs will materially increase in the future 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future 
for example  during the twelve months ended december   the sales price of our common stock fluctuated between and per share and subsequent to december  the market price had a high of per share 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance

this increase was partially offset by non recurring transactions  and a decrease in the timing of tenant reimbursements 
revenues from the company s real estate properties are generally derived from properties with single tenant and long term leases 
therefore  rental revenues recognized under generally accepted accounting principles do not fluctuate significantly 
rental revenue can vary due to future lease renewals  terminations and by the purchase or sale of additional properties 
mortgage interest expense continued to decrease as a result of continuing mortgage amortization 
such expense decreased  or for the year ended december   compared to mortgage interest expense on existing obligations of the company s real estate investment and management segment will continue to decline with scheduled principal reductions 
at december   the outstanding mortgage balance on the company s real estate investment properties was reduced to million 
depreciation expense associated with real properties held for rental increased  or for the year ended december   compared to  primarily attributable to depreciation expense  related to additions to real estate assets during the current and prior year  partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense associated with certain properties or improvements becoming fully depreciated in the prior year

the operating results of the engineered products segment are as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses operating income net sales of the engineered products segment increased for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  primarily due to an increased demand in the company s transformer product line which was brought about by an increase in capital spending 
this increase is partially offset by a slight decrease in the company s automotive product line which is still feeling the effects of continued softening of sales in the automotive industry 
sales of this segment are directly influenced by general economic conditions  worldwide automotive demand and industrial capital spending and could also be affected by changes in technology  competitive forces or challenges to its intellectual property 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased for the year ended december   compared to  primarily related to an increase in the cost of raw materials  primarily copper and steel components  which  where possible  have been passed along to customers

any future purchases in excess of par value will also reduce retained earnings 
repurchases of the company s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices and may be made in privately negotiated transactions  subject to available resources 
future proceeds from the issuance of common stock in excess of par value will be credited to retained earnings until such time that previously recorded reductions have been recovered

subsequent to year end  the company utilized million of the amount held in escrow to acquire a property in connection with a section tax deferred exchange 
the remaining balance of the escrow  plus interest  was remitted to the company 
management continues to believe that while there has been a decline in the value of certain real estate properties  the overall real estate market in the united states continues to be overvalued and accordingly acquisitions have been limited to those select properties that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
management believes that the available working capital puts the company in an opportune position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio  if and when attractive long term opportunities become available 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in to owned joint ventures in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
the debt of the joint venture in which the company currently has an ownership interest is a non recourse obligation and is collateralized by the entity s real property 
the company believes that the value of the underlying property and its operating cash flows are sufficient to satisfy its obligations 
the company is not obligated for the debts of the joint venture  but could decide to satisfy them in order to protect its investment 
in such event  the company s capital resources and financial condition would be reduced and  in certain instances  the carrying value of the company s investment and its results of operations would be negatively impacted 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations 
in addition  the company received additional financing from mortgages obtained on two of its hotels 
it is expected that future operational cash needs will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  marketable securities  ongoing operations or borrowings 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans may come from existing funds  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
the company currently has no agreements  commitments or understandings with respect to the acquisition of other companies or the acquisition of real properties in exchange for equity or debt securities 
funds of the company in excess of those needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates of deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances and other interest bearing investments 
given the level of cash and other interest bearing investments held by the company  changes in us interest rates could impact the company s earnings 
in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell common stock short or participate in put and or call options 
these instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore changes in such derivatives fair value are recognized in earnings 
these derivatives are recorded as a component of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company sells its engineered products to many customers throughout the world 
historically  a small number of customers have accounted for significant portions of these sales 
for the year ended december   sales by the engineered products segment to general motors  its largest customer  accounted for of the segment s sales 
since our engineered products segment accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  the loss of general motors as a customer  or a significant decline in sales to them  would adversely affect the company s revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as in europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
for the years ended december  and  and of the net sales of the company s engineered products segment were denominated in euros  respectively 
as such  a portion of the company s receivables are exposed to fluctuations with the us dollar 
however  the company does not believe this risk to be material to its overall financial position 
even with the recent strength of the euro in relation to the us dollar  the company s historical results have not been significantly impacted by foreign exchange gains or losses 
accordingly  the company has not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge this exposure 
if such exposure were to increase in the future  the company may reexamine this practice to minimize the associated risks 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has recorded a liability for the estimated investigation  remediation and administrative costs associated therewith 
see environmental regulations in item of part i and note  commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this matter 
the company is subject to various other litigation  legal  regulatory and tax matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
when management believes it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and such amounts are reasonably estimable  the company provides for amounts that include judgments and penalties that may be assessed 
these liabilities are usually included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities or other long term liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  depending on the anticipated payment date 
none of these matters are expected to result in a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of the estimates and assumptions required to be made relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of those accounting policies believed by management to require subjective and complex judgments which could potentially affect reported results 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable real estate investment and management the company leases substantially all of its properties to tenants under net leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
under this type of lease  the tenant is obligated to pay all operating costs of the property including real estate taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance 
revenue is recognized as earned and deemed collectible 
the effect of stepped rent increases on significant leases are recorded  net of allowances  on a straight line basis 
gains on sales of real estate assets and equity investments are recorded when the gain recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america have been met 
the company does not generally have leases that include significant rent concessions or provisions that require the lessee to fund capital improvements or to pay the lessor any revenues based upon indexes or rates that are not explicitly stated in the lease 
reimbursements of certain costs received from tenants are recognized as tenant reimbursement revenues 
certain lease agreements provide for additional rent based on a percentage of tenants sales 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales levels are achieved 
income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method that produces a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease  net of the related deferred tax liability  in the years in which the net investment is positive 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts receivable related to base rents  tenant escalations  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable hotel operations revenues from the company s hotel operations are generally recognized when earned 
hotel revenues primarily represent room rental and food and beverage sales and are recognized at the time of the hotel stay or sale of restaurant services 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts which include the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experience 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable engineered products in general  sales are recorded when products are shipped  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
management believes that adequate controls are in place to ensure compliance with contractual product specifications  a substantial history of such performance has been established and historical returns and allowances have not been significant 
if actual sales returns and allowances exceed historical amounts  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts  net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collections experience  current economic trends and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historical write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality of its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
marketable securities the company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reassesses the appropriateness of such classification at each reporting date 
at december  and  all marketable securities held by the company have been classified as available for sale and  as a result  are stated at fair value  based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities  as determined on a first in  first out basis  are included in the consolidated statements of income 
the company reviews its investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if it is believed that an other than temporary decline exists  the company will write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s classification of marketable securities  as well as its determination of whether an other than temporary decline in the value of its investments exists 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineering changes to its products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of the realizability of inventories 
real estate land  buildings and improvements and equipment are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  five to years for renovations and improvements and five to years for equipment and fixtures 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation is discontinued 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers 
upon disposition  the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
any gain or loss on sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the normal course of business  the company receives offers for the sale of properties  either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  the prospective buyer usually requires a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  management decides not to sell a property classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held for rental 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of its carrying amount before being classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for rental or its fair market value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company adjust the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over the adjusted years  and result in a revised depreciation expense and net income 
discontinued operations the company is required to make certain subjective assessments utilizing the provisions of sfas no 
in determining whether a long lived asset to be disposed of should be reclassified as discontinued operations 
the company considers real property to be held for sale and reported as discontinued operations if management commits to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms and believes such sale will be completed within one year 
in such event  the financial results associated with these assets are reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
although operating income  income from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations are directly affected by management s assessments  the reclassification has no impact on net income 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of its long lived assets may be impaired 
an asset s value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the asset over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the asset 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its long lived assets and other investments 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted sfas no 
pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  but represent obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plan and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
these assumptions are used in actuarial calculations to estimate pension costs as well as pension assets or liabilities included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the company s pension costs and obligations 
the company has assumed the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be in each of the last two years 
based on the company s existing and forecasted asset allocation and related long term investment performance results  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in net periodic pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future net periodic pension income expense 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have changed fiscal net periodic pension expense by  recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition
