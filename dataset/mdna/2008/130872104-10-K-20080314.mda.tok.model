our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  and factors affecting operating results below  as well as those discussed elsewhere 
the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
overview caliper develops and sells innovative and enabling products and services to the life sciences research community  a customer base that includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and government and other not for profit research institutions 
we believe our integrated systems  consisting of instruments  software and reagents  our laboratory automation tools and our assay and discovery services enable researchers to better understand the basis for disease and more effectively discover safe and effective drugs 
our strategy is to transform drug discovery and development by offering technologies and services that ultimately enhance the ability to predict the effects that new drug candidates will have on humans 
our offerings leverage our extensive portfolio of molecular imaging  microfluidics  automation and liquid handling technologies  and scientific applications expertise to address key limitations in the drug discovery and development process namely  the complex and costly process to conceive of and bring a new drug to market 
we believe that increasing the clinical relevance of drug discovery experimentation  whether at early stage  lower cost  in vitro test tube testing or later stage  more expensive preclinical in vivo in a living organism testing  will have a profound impact in helping our customers to determine the ultimate likelihood of success of drugs in treating humans 
with enabling offerings in both the in vitro and in vivo testing arenas  and a unique strategy of enhancing the bridge or linkages between in vitro  in vivo and the clinic in order to optimize the cost of the experiment versus the clinical insight gained  we expect to continue to address growing  unmet needs in the market and drive on going demand for our products and services 
these market needs are underscored by key challenges that face the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including late stage drug failures and unforeseen side effects coming to light late in the development process or even after drugs are on the market 
we presently offer an array of products and services  many based on highly enabling proprietary technologies that address critical experimental needs in drug discovery and preclinical development  and related processes including drug formulation and quality control 
our technologies are also enabling for other life sciences applications beyond drug discovery  such as environmental related testing  and in applied markets such as agriculture and forensics 
we also believe that our technology platforms may be able to provide ease of use  cost and data quality benefits for certain in vitro and in vivo diagnostic applications 
we are presently pursuing potential longer term diagnostic opportunities through partners under our caliper driven program 
we have multiple channels of distribution for our products direct to customers  indirect through our international network of distributors  through partnership channels under our caliper driven program and through joint marketing agreements 
through our direct and indirect channels  we sell products  services and complete system solutions  developed by us  to end customers 
our caliper driven program is core to our business strategy and complementary to our direct sales and distribution network activities  as it enables us to extend the commercial potential of our labchip and advanced liquid handling technologies into new industries and new applications with experienced commercial partners 
we also utilize joint marketing agreements to enable others to market and distribute our products 
by using direct and indirect distribution  and out licensing our technology under our caliper driven program  we seek to maximize penetration of our products and technologies into the marketplace and position caliper as a leader in the life sciences tools market 
overview recent performance trends significant developments and trends among each of our key product families during included optical imaging 
in  cumulative placements of ivis imaging systems surpassed units  making  we believe  one of the most successful platforms ever offered for pre clinical molecular imaging 
in  optical imaging product and services revenue increased by taking into account sales that were completed by xenogen prior to the acquisition and assuming we owned xenogen for all of over we believe that there is continued substantial market opportunity for this product line to grow 
in  we grew our ivis reagents business more than 
although our ivis reagents business is still small in terms of absolute size  we expect this business to represent an important growth catalyst in and later years 
we have observed that recent sales of our ivis systems have expanded beyond the historic core emphasis of oncology  to include therapeutic areas such as central nervous system disorders  infectious disease  inflammation and stem cell research 
we are anticipating approximately revenue growth per year from optical imaging products and services over the next several years 
microfluidics 
during  we achieved combined product and service growth in microfluidics  supported by continuing growth of our labchip instruments and emergence of demand for our ez reader and profiler pro kinase profiling and reagent systems 
we also achieved growth in microfluidic license and contract revenues in compared to  however  a significant portion of this revenue  approximately million  related to substantial license transactions which we do not anticipate will recur in subsequent periods 
our plans for are to drive productivity improvement in microfluidics research and development through consolidation of our west coast facilities  and a redirection of resources toward broadening the capabilities and market attractiveness of our microfluidics product offerings across both our direct and indirect distribution channels 
we expect to be able to quantify and discuss the savings opportunity enabled by this initiative sometime during our fiscal second quarter 
we are also exploring forensics and next generation sequencing sample preparation and molecular diagnostics as opportunities for long term growth 
we are anticipating approximately revenue growth per year from microfluidics products and services over the next several years 
liquid handling and automation 
during  we experienced an overall decline in liquid handling and automation product and service revenue as a result of sales management turnover and competitive factors 
we see the markets for liquid handling and automation as mature and intensely competitive  however  we believe we can continue to achieve success in these areas in a number of ways 
we recently installed new sales management leadership to revitalize both our direct and indirect channel business  and believe that we will benefit as a result of several competitors either being acquired or exiting the marketplace in we also recently launched aces  a program for automation  consulting  engineering and services targeted at revitalizing our staccato systems business 
we are anticipating approximately revenue growth per year from liquid handling and automation products and services over the next several years 
cdas 
during  cdas service revenues grew by approximately taking into account sales that were completed by xenogen biosciences prior to the acquisition  and thus assuming we owned xenogen biosciences for all of 
growth was balanced among both in vivo and in vitro services 
in vivo growth resulted primarily from expansion of phenotyping and compound profiling services with a few large pharmaceutical companies  and in vitro services grew as a result of a major contract awarded to us by the epa for toxicity screening in order to assist the agency with shifting more of its agricultural chemicals testing toward in vitro analysis as opposed to animal testing 
this program  called toxcast screening  has the potential to generate significant revenues over the next several years  however  the program is in its early beginning stages and relies on federal budget authorization 
we are anticipating approximately revenue growth in cdas service revenues over the next several years 
summary gaap financial performance we achieved million of total revenue in  an increase of from million of total revenue in our key growth drivers in were optical imaging product revenues  resulting primarily from our first full year of sales of ivis imaging systems  cdas revenue growth  which benefited from our first full year of in vivo drug discovery service revenue from xenogen biosciences now part of cdas  and  to a lesser extent  revenue generated as a result of the toxcast screening contract awarded to us by the epa during  and a substantial increase in license fees from our first full year of optical imaging license revenue and several significant new microfluidic license transactions entered into during  the latter of which is expected to be non recurring 
on a pro forma basis  our total revenues grew by compared to on a pro forma basis  which takes into consideration sales that were completed by xenogen prior to the acquisition  and assuming we owned xenogen for all of product gross margins improved to in versus in primarily as a result of increased sales volumes resulting in greater leverage of fixed spending within our manufacturing operations  and lower material costs achieved as a result of strategic sourcing initiatives enacted in early service gross margins improved to in from in due to increased service revenues from cdas  which resulted in improved cost leverage 
however  in relation to service revenue  xenogen biosciences cost structure is comparably higher than our historic service cost structure  thus weighing down our service gross margins when compared to historic periods 
operating expenses increased million in in comparison to this increase primarily reflects the incremental operating expenses of xenogen  including additional amortization of intangible assets 
the increase also reflects investments in selling and marketing efforts as well as an increase in litigation and other legal costs 
however  principally due to the settlement of our litigation with anticancer in february  our legal costs are expected to decrease in net loss for was million  or per share  compared to net loss of million  or per share in this improvement resulted primarily from the bottom line benefit of having a full year of xenogen consolidated into our operations  gross margin improvement and realization of cost savings through the completion of integration related activities 
legal settlement on february   we entered into a settlement agreement and a cross license agreement with anticancer  bringing to an end ongoing litigation that existed at the time we purchased xenogen in this cross license arrangement enables us to provide license rights for fluorescent protein imaging with a broader and more clarified portfolio of patents 
conclusion of this ongoing litigation should allow us to reduce legal costs in for this matter 
results of operations revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands product revenue     service revenue     license fees and contract revenue    total revenue     total revenue 
our total revenue increase in compared to resulted primarily from product growth within our optical imaging and microfluidics product lines  increases in drug discovery services revenues generated by cdas  and new intellectual property license revenue generated under both our optical imaging and microfluidic patent estates and the effect of the xenogen acquisition 
on a combined basis  our optical imaging and microfluidics product lines accounted for million of our total product revenue  representing an increase of million  or  over comparable product revenues in this growth more than offset a revenue decrease of million  or decline  experienced among our liquid handling and automation product lines  which accounted for million of our total product revenue 
service revenue growth resulted primarily from our first full year of in vivo drug discovery service revenue from xenogen biosciences  now part of cdas  and to a lesser extent revenue generated as a result of the epa toxcast screening contract awarded to us during license fees and contract revenues increased overall as a result of our first full year of optical imaging license revenue and several significant new microfluidic license transactions entered into during  the latter of which is expected to be non recurring 
these additional license revenues offset an overall decrease of million in collaboration research and government grant revenues related to projects concluded at the end of or during our total revenue increase in over resulted primarily from growth driven by our acquisitions of xenogen in august of and novascreen in october of product revenue growth was mainly attributable to post acquisition sales of optical imaging products  which totaled million 
this new source of product revenue offset a decline in other product sales caused mainly by a million decrease in revenue from gcas system sales  which we sold to affymetrix under an oem arrangement  in compared to services provided by cdas were the principal drivers of service growth during in comparison to in addition  license fees and contract revenue increased over as a result of a substantial license grant under our caliper driven licensing program 
product revenue 
product revenue increased during compared to  primarily as a result of sales of optical imaging products which were added to our product portfolio as a result of our acquisition of xenogen in august overall  optical imaging products  which includes ivis imaging systems and related consumables and reagents  accounted for million of our increase in revenue in  and of total product revenue  with being the first full year of sales of this product line 
we sold a total of ivis imaging systems in  which represented a increase in units sold compared to  including during the period in which xenogen was a stand alone entity 
sales of microfluidic products  comprised of labchip instruments and chips  increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the key reasons for this improvement were the introduction of the ez reader kinase screening platform and associated profilerpro reagent kits in the first quarter of  and continued strong demand for the labchip automated electrophoresis system 
during we placed a total of new labchip systems with customers  which represented a increase in units sold compared to sales of liquid handling and automation products declined by million on a net basis overall  or  from million in to million in this decline was driven mainly by a substantial decrease of million in sales of liquid handling and automation products  primarily as a result of weakness experienced in oem sales and integrated staccato platform sales  which was partially offset by a million increase in sales of analytical instruments for drug development and other specialty applications such as forensics analysis 
we believe that the decline in liquid handling and automation product sales was due  in part  to temporary market conditions as evidenced by an increase in customer orders in our fiscal fourth quarter which led to a stronger ending backlog for such products at the end of in comparison to the end of in addition  during we introduced zephyr  a lower priced  desktop version of our sciclone liquid handler and have begun to see strong initial customer interest in this newer liquid handling product 
finally  in response to the decrease in oem product sales  we took steps to realign sales management and focus greater resources on the oem channel effective at the start of product revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of acquisition related growth from xenogen optical imaging product sales  which generated million of revenue in this increase was offset by a net decrease of million  or  in all other product sales caused primarily by a sharp reduction in gcas system sales to affymetrix  which were million lower in in comparison to excluding the gcas decrease  all other product sales increased by million  or  led by increased sales of microfluidics products of million  and increased sales of drug development analytical instruments of million 
during we placed a total of new labchip systems with customers versus systems in service revenue 
service revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of in vivo drug discovery services performed by xenogen biosciences which became part of cdas in overall  the in vivo arm of cdas generated million of incremental service revenue for us in  adding to million of in vitro service revenue growth performed by our novascreen business unit  the majority of which resulted from the toxcast screening contract that we were awarded by the epa during in addition  we experienced a million increase in billable services and support contracts associated with our installed instrument base 
this increase was primarily driven by substantial new placements of ivis imaging systems in service revenue increased during in comparison to primarily as a result of acquisition related growth relating to our cdas operations 
during the year ended december   traditional product support services decreased by from due to of the retirement of older systems in the drug discovery automation serviceable installed base 
license fees and contract revenue 
license fees and contract revenue increased during compared to primarily as a result of million of optical imaging license revenue  and an increase of million in revenue from license rights granted under our microfluidic patent portfolio 
we do not anticipate significant new microfluidic license revenues in these sources of revenue were partially offset by a decrease in collaboration research revenue of million in as compared to and a decrease in certain government funded research projects of approximately million over this same period 
license fees and contract revenue increased during compared to  primarily as a result of government funded research projects conducted at novascreen and optical imaging license revenue generated by xenogen 
combined  these new sources of revenue generated approximately million of revenue  which was offset by a decrease of million in collaboration research revenue due to projects that were finalized in and during we also had a net increase in license fees of million from license rights granted under our microfluidic patent portfolio 
cost of revenue year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands cost of product revenue     service revenue     license revenue    total cost of revenue     cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue increased during primarily due to the overall increase in product sales  including especially sales of optical imaging products as discussed above 
materials costs within cost of product revenue were approximately of sales in versus of sales in  reflecting improvement related to strategic sourcing initiatives while other variable product costs were approximately of product sales versus in reflecting primarily increased sales subject to third party royalties and incremental inventory reserve needs due to parts made obsolete by recent product introductions 
overall labor and manufacturing overhead decreased by approximately million  from million or of sales in  to million  or of sales in leading to overall product gross margin percentage improvement  as discussed below 
the labor and overhead spending reductions resulted primarily from indirect labor cost reductions implemented in our hopkinton  massachusetts manufacturing plant during and reduced warranty support labor 
cost of product revenue increased during primarily due to the overall increase in product sales  including especially sales of optical imaging products as discussed above 
materials costs within cost of product revenue were approximately of sales in versus of sales in  while other variable product costs were approximately of product sales versus in reflecting increased warranty costs in related primarily to staccato and labchip systems under contract 
overall labor and manufacturing overhead increased by approximately million  from million or of sales in  to million  or of sales in an increase in cost of product revenue in of million is primarily related to stock based compensation associated with the adoption of sfas r on january  cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue increased during compared to primarily due to having a full year of xenogen biosciences within our cdas operations which caused service costs to increase by million 
also within cdas  novascreen s service costs increased by approximately million during compared to as a result of increased staffing and material costs primarily associated with the epa toxcast screening program 
in addition to these primary increases  labor and other costs related to billable services and support contracts associated with our installed instrument base increased by approximately million worldwide 
cost of service revenue increased during primarily due to service related costs of xenogen and novascreen which were new to caliper in in comparison to on a combined basis  costs related to these operations increased by million during cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue increased during as compared to as a result of royalties due under our exclusive license with stanford for sublicenses of optical imaging intellectual property rights  as well as royalties and license fees paid to certain other third parties for other in licensed technologies  including as further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
gross margins 
gross margin on product revenue was for  as compared to in which was a result of the combined effects of reduced manufacturing labor and overhead costs in relation to higher sales volumes as described above 
gross margin on service revenue was for and for this modest improvement reflected improved productivity leverage achieved at novascreen related to the epa toxcast contract  partially offset by lower gross margins associated with xenogen biosciences in vivo drug discovery service revenues 
in relation to service revenue  xenogen biosciences cost structure is comparably higher than our historic service cost structure  thus weighing down our service gross margins when compared to historic periods 
gross margin on product revenue was for  as compared to during during  margins improved by percentage points primarily related to the increased utilization of the hopkinton plant driven by the acquisition of xenogen 
greater cost absorption due to volume and changes in product mix resulted in a percentage point improvement 
the increase was offset by approximately million  or percentage points  in transitional manufacturing costs related to xenogen s alameda  california  manufacturing facility  which remained open through october  in addition to the foregoing  the adoption of sfas r in had a percentage point unfavorable impact on product gross margins in comparison to increased warranty costs resulted in the majority of the remaining percentage point impact  which offset overall margin improvements 
operating expenses year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands research and development    selling  general and administrative   amortization of intangible assets    restructuring charges credits  net research and development expenses 
research and development spending increased by million  net  versus this increase consisted of a number of changes in spending  including as follows a million reduction for in process research and development projects acquired from xenogen in that were completed by us in  a million overall decrease in liquid handling and microfluidics project spending consisting of million in reduced labor related costs  million in reduced material and operating supplies and million of reduction in all other costs  and a million increase in optical imaging research and development costs consisting primarily of approximately million in increased labor related costs  million in increased facilities related costs as a result of a full year of xenogen s operations and million of increase in all other costs 
we continue to evaluate research and development spending based on anticipated revenues and market opportunities 
our plans for are to drive productivity improvement in microfluidics research and development through consolidation of our west coast facilities  and a redirection of resources toward broadening the capabilities and market attractiveness of our microfluidics product offerings across both our direct and indirect distribution channels 
we expect to be able to quantify the savings opportunity enabled by this initiative sometime during our fiscal second quarter 
we are also exploring forensics and next generation sequencing sample preparation and molecular diagnostics as opportunities for long term growth 
research and development spending increased by million during compared to this increase consisted of a number of changes in spending  including as follows a million increase for in process research and development projects acquired from xenogen in  million of new spending  including million of imaging biology and physics research performed by xenogen million in labor related costs  million in facilities related costs and million of all other costs  and million of grant related research and assay development research performed by novascreen million in labor related costs  million in facilities related costs and million of all other costs  million of additional stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r  and all other research and development expenses  consisting primarily of labor related costs and project materials  decreased by approximately million during compared to as a percentage of revenues  we expect research and development spending to generally decrease in the future  to the extent our revenues continue to grow  and as we continue to closely manage discretionary spending on research programs with attractive commercial potential 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million during compared to primarily due to the full year results of xenogen included in our operations 
in general  costs and expenses were affected by the integration of xenogen s business with our ongoing operations as follows 
sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million due to the full year impact of  on average  approximately additional sales and marketing employees and million in increased legal expenses 
the remaining increase of million related primarily to sales and marketing expenses of million and million in general and administrative costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from million of labor related expenses including a reallocation of existing personnel resources from other areas of the business  million of legal spending for litigation and other legal costs  million of sales and marketing related expenses  million of legal and advisory services related to merger and acquisition activity  million of increased provision for doubtful accounts  and million of other costs  offset by a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million during compared to consisting primarily of million of new spending  including million of xenogen expenses and million of novascreen expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense increased by approximately million related to the adoption of sfas r in the remaining increase of million included increased accounting  audit fees and consulting fees of approximately million which were largely related to xenogen integration related activities and strategic planning  million of increased legal expenses related to patent work  and increases in all other expenses of approximately million 
xenogen related expenses included approximately million of labor related expenses  million of legal expenses consisting primarily of litigation costs  and million of spending across other areas 
the novascreen related expenses in this area comprised approximately million in labor related costs  million in facilities related costs and million of all other costs 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  related to assets acquired with our acquisitions of zymark  novascreen and xenogen 
amortization is computed based upon the estimated timing of the undiscounted cash flows used to value each respective asset over the estimated useful life of the particular intangible asset  or using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset when the pattern of cash flows is not necessarily reflective of the true consumption rate of the particular intangible asset 
amortization expense in included a charge of million related to the impairment of certain intangible assets established with the acquisition of novascreen 
the charge consisted of  related to the novascreen trade name and  related to government grants and contracts  each of which was written off during the fourth quarter of the charge for the trade name relates to caliper s decision to combine its drug discovery screening and profiling services for both in vitro and in vivo research under a new trade name  caliper discovery and alliance services 
the charge for government contracts and grants resulted from a relative lack of success in obtaining new sources of government research and development funding  due to increased competition for funding 
restructuring charges credits 
we incurred restructuring charges in  and related to acquisition and integration activities that are more fully discussed in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
restructuring charges during related to accretion of interest on facilities  net of sub lease income 
restructuring charges during relate to a charge for increased operating costs on idle facilities and accretion of interest on facilities  net of sub lease income 
in  we recorded a restructuring credit of million in connection with new subleases entered into during in determining the amount of restructuring credit to record  we considered all future sublease income for which we have reasonable assurance of collection and discounted the future cash flows using the same discount rate that was used originally to calculate the restructuring liability 
interest and other income and expenses year ended december  change change year ended december  change change year ended december  in thousands interest income interest expense  other income expense  net  interest income 
interest income decreased in both and primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  on average  over the previous years due to cash used in operating and investing activities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased in compared to as a result of a full year of interest charges under the credit facility which was established in august  including a million increase in average outstanding borrowings during the second half of interest expense in reflected a partial year of interest expense of approximately million of outstanding borrowing from august through december other income  net 
other income  net increased million in compared to primarily from gains associated with recording account balances denominated in non us currencies at fair market value 
during  we incurred foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  compared to  in other income  net increased in compared to primarily from gains and losses associated with recording account balances denominated in non us currencies at fair market value 
during  we incurred foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  compared to transaction losses of  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term restricted cash  as compared to million as of december  and million as of december  on february   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement credit facility with a bank  which permits us to borrow up to million in the form of revolving loan advances  including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
the credit facility amends and restates in its entirety a certain loan and security agreement by and among us and the bank dated as of august   as amended 
principal borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the prime rate if our unrestricted cash held at the bank exceeds or is equal to million  or prime plus one half of one percentage point if our unrestricted cash held at the bank is below million 
under the credit facility  we are permitted to borrow up to million  provided we maintain unrestricted cash of at least million with the bank  or are otherwise subject to a borrowing base limit consisting of up to a of eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit facility  plus b the lesser of of our unrestricted cash maintained at the bank or million 
the credit facility matures on june  as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility includes traditional lending and reporting covenants including that certain financial covenants applicable to liquidity and earnings are to be maintained by us and tested as of the last day of each quarter 
the credit facility also includes several potential events of default such as payment default  material adverse change conditions and insolvency conditions that could cause interest to be charged at prime plus two percentage points 
any uncured events of default may result in the bank s right to declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable 
we intend to utilize the credit facility as a source of capital for ongoing operations and working capital needs 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to fund operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in businesses  product development  restructured facility obligations  and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our credit facility 
significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by  among other factors  a decrease in demand for our products  our ability to integrate acquisitions  deterioration in certain financial ratios  and market changes in general 
we believe our cash balance  working capital on hand at december  and access to available capital under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through at least december  nevertheless  our actual cash needs could vary considerably  depending on opportunities and circumstances that arise over time 
if  at any time  cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to reduce our costs and expenses  sell additional equity or debt securities or draw down on our current credit facility if we have borrowing capacity 
the inability to obtain additional financing may  among other circumstances  force delays in research and product development activities  sell certain assets  or  ultimately  cause us to cease operations 
on november   we filed  and the securities and exchange commission subsequently declared effective  a universal shelf registration statement on form s that will permit us to raise up to million of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants or units  either individually or in units  as described by the prospectus 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that we will be successful in these endeavors 
we maintain cash balances in many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences 
however  these cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have transferred  and will continue to transfer  cash from our subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
cash flows year ended december  change year ended december  change year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities     investing activities     financing activities     operating activities 
in we used million of cash for operating activities which included approximately million of final severance payments to former xenogen employees corresponding to the integration related restructuring charge taken in  payments of million pursuant to continuing lease obligations for unused facilities  and million to fund other business and working capital needs 
this latter amount was comprised of our net loss of million offset by i non cash charges of million for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  and ii million from reduced working capital needs resulting primarily from faster customer collections in relation to the timing of our vendor obligations 
investing activities 
during  net proceeds from purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities generated million of cash  which we used primarily for operations 
our primary investing activities were the purchases of million of property and equipment and million for the purchase of other assets 
financing activities 
during  financing cash proceeds were principally comprised of million of net borrowings under our credit facility 
other proceeds were from stock proceeds realized from employee participation in our employee stock purchase plan and option exercises 
contractual obligations as of december   we had commitments under leases and other contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations     severance obligations idle facility obligations   total obligations     in addition to the commitments in the table above  as of december   we had a non cancelable purchase commitment in the amount of approximately million with the foreign supplier of our glass stock used in the manufacture of certain types of chips and approximately million with two of our suppliers of cameras and one filter supplier for in vivo imaging instrumentation 
these commitments are excluded from the above table due to the fact they are not specifically related to a given time period 
we also have minimum royalty obligations under separate license agreements with ut battelle  llc  the trustees of the university of pennsylvania  monogram biosciences  inc  and certain other licensors that in the aggregate would never exceed  per year 
as of december   we have established million in standby letters of credit  which restrict available borrowing under our credit facility  related to facility leases and customer deposits 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  and acquisitions 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continuing our research and development efforts  expanding our support and product development activities  and for other general corporate activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued market acceptance of our microfluidic and lab automation products  the magnitude and scope of our research and product development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
financial projections our revenue projection for the first quarter of is to million  and our revenue projection for the full year is to million 
our revenue projection encompasses combined product and service revenue for the first quarter of of to million and for the full year of to million  representing and product and service revenue growth at the midpoint of the respective ranges 
the financial projections that we have provided above are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties  and are only made as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
these projections are based upon assumptions that we have made and believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may vary significantly from these projections due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business as described in item a  risk factors 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   caliper did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as that term is defined in the rules and regulations of the sec 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and assets and liabilities during the periods reported 
we use estimates when accounting for certain items such as warranty expense  sales and marketing programs  employee compensation programs  depreciation and amortization periods  taxes  inventory values  and valuations of investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where applicable  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to changing conditions or the validity of our assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  we allocate the consideration among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and consider the applicable revenue recognition criteria separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
we determine fair value of undelivered items based upon our historic selling prices  or where no historic information exists  based upon management s estimate of the probable selling prices for such undelivered items 
the amount of our product revenue is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether there is objective evidence of fair value for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
these conditions are sometimes subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
we recognize certain service and contract revenue for certain arrangements based upon proportional performance which requires that we estimate resources required to perform the work 
the extent to which our resource estimates prove to be inaccurate could affect the timing of the revenue recognition for a particular contract arrangement

we perform a test for the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the company with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
we performed our fiscal annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based upon our market capitalization at the time  we concluded that we did not have any impairment 
valuation of intangibles 
our business acquisitions have resulted in intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization of million as of december  the determination of the value of such assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we acquired xenogen on august  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the xenogen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
we acquired novascreen on october  in connection with this acquisition we used an independent appraisal to determine the fair value of intangibles related to the novascreen business 
the fair value was determined based upon projected future discounted cash flows of identified intangible assets taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of developed technology 
the valuation approach took into consideration discount rates commensurate with the inherent risk and projected financial results associated with each identified intangible asset 
applicable discount rates used ranged from to 
impairment 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we perform the recoverability measurement and estimate undiscounted cash flows at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate the resulting impairment charge to be recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
actual cash flows could vary from the assumptions used in our assessment which could require future adjustments to our valuation of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement as an operating expense  based on their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using a black scholes merton based option pricing model 
various assumption are used in these estimations  including expected volatility  which is based on historical volatility of our stock and warrants  expected option term  which is based on our historical option exercise data taking into consideration the exercise patterns of the option holders during the option s life  risk free interest rate  based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant  and forfeiture rate 
a unfavorable change in expected volatility and option term  which represent the most sensitive and judgmental assumptions  would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves 
we grant credit to customers based on evaluations of their financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
we attempt to limit credit risk by monitoring our exposure for credit losses 
this analysis may involve review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
we establish allowances for those accounts considered uncollectible based on the analysis of the recoverability of our trade accounts receivable performed at the end of each reporting period 
establishing an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts involves the use of considerable judgment and subjectivity 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to estimate the adequacy of our accounts receivable reserves which could require future adjustment to our reserve provisions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  and million as of december  and  respectively 
we wrote off   and  of accounts deemed uncollectible in  and  respectively 
inventory reserves 
we reserve or write off of the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excess 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
we use a twelve month demand forecast and  in addition to the demand forecast  we also consider parts and subassemblies that can be used in alternative finished products  parts and subassemblies that are unlikely to be impacted by engineering changes  and known design changes which would reduce our ability to use the inventory as planned 
determination of the excess balance is highly subjective and relies in part on the accuracy of our forecasts and our assessment of market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  additional write downs may be required 
conversely  if conditions are more favorable than conditions upon which we base our estimates  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations in that period 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million   and  to cost of product revenues for excess and obsolete inventories 
the increase in excess and obsolete inventories occurred primarily as a result of product evolution and new product introductions 
warranty provision 
at the time revenue is recognized  we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
we offer a one year limited warranty on instrumentation products and a day warranty on chips  which is included in the sales price of many of its products 
our standard limited warranty covers repair or replacement of defective goods  a preventative maintenance visit on certain products  and telephone based technical support 
no upgrades are included in the standard warranty 
provision is made for estimated future warranty costs at the time of sale 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary 
during  and  respectively  we recorded charges of million  million and million to cost of product revenues for estimated warranty costs 
the decrease in relates primarily to the overall decrease in sales of liquid handling and automation products  especially staccato and labchip sales that are no longer under warranty that have historically incurred a higher rate of warranty incidents 
actual results could vary from the assumptions we use to establish the warranty liability which could require future adjustments to our reserve positions 
restructuring charges 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded restructuring charges credits of million  million  and million  respectively  for exit plan activities which took place in the period and accounted for these plans in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and ability of the tenant to pay leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sublease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sublease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we recorded a restructuring credit of approximately million to recognize the net present value of future sublease rental income based upon subleases we were able to secure during for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the effect  if any  of adopting sfas on our financial position and results of operations has not been determined 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards  which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities  on an instrument by instrument basis 
if the fair value option is elected  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  with earlier adoption permitted 
we have elected not to adopt early and are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf no 
is effective for collaborative arrangements in place at the beginning of the annual period beginning after december  as our collaborative agreements do not incorporate such revenue and cost sharing arrangements  we do not expect the adoption of eitf no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r sfas r  business combinations 
this standard will require an acquiring company to measure all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies  at fair value as of the acquisition date 
in addition  an acquiring company is required to capitalize ipr d and either amortize it over the life of the product  or write it off if the project is abandoned or impaired 
the standard is effective for transactions occurring on or after january  we are evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency as a multinational company  we are subject to changes in foreign currency fluctuations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  switzerland  canada and japan 
to the extent our sales and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
while foreign exchange gains and losses have historically been immaterial  we cannot predict whether such gains and losses will continue to be immaterial 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in exchange rates applied to our projected foreign operations for the fiscal year a hypothetical movement in exchange rates could materially impact our reported sales 
however  because both sales and expenses are denominated in local currency  this analysis indicated that such movement would not have a material effect on net operating results or financial condition 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would not have materially impacted net income or materially affected the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments at either december  or as of december  we had million in debt outstanding under our credit facility 
the interest rate on the facility is based on the prime rate currently and therefore has direct and immediate response to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  and corporate bonds 
our portfolio excludes auction rate securities 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december  and  the average remaining maturities of our investment portfolio were approximately five and six months  respectively 
all of our instruments are held other than for trading purposes 
as of december  and  unrealized losses were considered to be temporary due to the fact  although available to be sold to meet operating needs or otherwise  securities are generally held to maturity 
the following table presents by year of maturity the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments  and related weighted average interest rates that may be subject to interest rate risk as of december  total fair value december  cash and money market funds fixed rate securities in thousands   average interest rate available for sale marketable securities fixed rate securities in thousands   average interest rate total securities in thousands   average interest rate this differs from our position at december   which the following table presents dollars in thousands total fair value december  cash and money market funds fixed rate securities in thousands   average interest rate available for sale marketable securities fixed rate securities in thousands    average interest rate total securities in thousands    average interest rate
