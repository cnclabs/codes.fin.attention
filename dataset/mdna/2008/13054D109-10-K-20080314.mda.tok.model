item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of march   we own  license or franchise locations in states  the district of columbia and foreign countries  of which are company owned and operate under the names california pizza kitchen  california pizza kitchen asap  and la food show and the remaining of which operate under franchise or license arrangements 
during our years of operating history  we believe we have developed strong brand awareness and demonstrated the appeal of our concept in a wide variety of geographic areas 
our concept was  and still remains  to take our customers favorite food cravings and put them on a pizza to figuratively put the world on a pizza 
we opened our first casual dining restaurant in in beverly hills  california and grew steadily to restaurants by early our concept  with its signature line of innovative  premium pizzas  open flame ovens in exhibition style kitchens and excellent guest service  attracted pepsico  which bought a controlling interest in our company in may during the approximate five year period when pepsico was our controlling stockholder  we opened restaurants  of which were subsequently closed 
we experimented with different locations and different restaurant sizes  ranging from  square feet to more than  square feet 
our rapid expansion strained our infrastructure  resulted in a variety of management and operational changes  diverted our attention from the execution of our concept and led to disappointing operating results and financial performance  including a decline in comparable restaurant sales in at the end of  pepsico concluded that it would sell or otherwise divest all of its restaurant businesses  including california pizza kitchen 
in september  we consummated a series of transactions to effect a merger and leveraged recapitalization through which an investor group led by bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  lp acquired pepsico s interest in our company 
in  we instituted an accelerated growth plan  focusing largely on further penetrating our existing markets 
between january and december  we opened company owned  full service restaurants and cpk asap restaurants 
following rapid expansion in underdeveloped markets  the board of directors asked richard rosenfield and larry flax  co founders and co chairmen of the board  to reassume the responsibilities of co ceos 
in connection with this management change  we reviewed our restaurant portfolio  as well as our operations and growth strategy  and decided to slow down our new restaurant opening schedule  emphasizing quality and profitability beginning in fiscal we introduced our new prototype full service restaurant in fiscal  which is larger than our former prototype 
the new prototype is approximately  square feet  has approximately indoor and outdoor seats and has been designed to create a more comfortable experience that will enhance our dinner business 
total cash investment per full service restaurant in was million for inline restaurants and million for freestanding restaurants which has not been reduced by any tenant improvement allowances 
pre opening expenses for each of these new restaurants was approximately  to  it is common in the restaurant industry for new restaurant locations to initially open with sales volumes well in excess of their sustainable run rate levels 
this initial honeymoon effect usually results from promotional and other consumer awareness activities that generate abnormally high customer traffic for our restaurants 
during the several months following the opening of a new restaurant  customer traffic generally settles into its normal pattern  resulting in sales volumes that gradually adjust downward to their expected sustained run rate level 
additionally  our new restaurants usually require a to day period after opening to reach their targeted restaurant level operating margin due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies commonly associated with 
table of contents new restaurants 
as a result  a significant number of restaurant openings in any single fiscal quarter  accompanied with their associated pre opening costs  could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations for that period 
therefore  our results of operations for any single fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
our revenues are comprised of restaurant sales  franchise royalties and other income 
our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
our franchise royalties and other revenues consist primarily of monthly royalty income  initial franchise fees and license fees from our trademark license agreement with kraft 
cost of sales is comprised of food  beverage and paper supplies  labor  and direct operating and occupancy expenses 
the components of food  beverage and paper supplies are variable and increase with sales volume 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  stock based compensation  bonuses and taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct operating and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
direct operating and occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  stock based compensation  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  currently consist of rent from the date construction begins through the restaurant opening date  the costs of hiring and training the initial work force  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
as of december  we had company owned restaurants that met this criterion

potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  changes in food costs  changes in labor costs  war and weather conditions 
in the past we have experienced significant variability in pre opening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of restaurant openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a given restaurant in the month of opening 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and direct operating and occupancy costs associated with a newly opened restaurant during the first three to four months of operation are often materially greater than what will be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
accordingly  the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  we expect our highest earnings to occur in those periods 
as a result of all of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full year 
liquidity and capital resources prior to  we funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flow from operations 
in  we supplemented this utilizing our line of credit 
in  net cash flow provided by operating activities was million compared to million in and million in 
table of contents net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded net income for primarily due to the effects of depreciation and amortization  non cash compensation charges  store closure costs and deferred rent credits partially offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities and net changes in net deferred tax assets 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities in was primarily due to increases in accrued and other liabilities partially offset by a decrease in other receivables and amortization of deferred rent credits 
we use working capital to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodel our existing restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities was million in we opened full service restaurants and cpk asap restaurant in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of million in  which primarily resulted from million spent on new restaurants and million spent on capitalized costs and remodels 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in and consisted of short term borrowings  employee common stock option exercises purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and stock repurchases 
on august   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program august program to acquire the company s common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the august program  up to million of the company s common stock could be reacquired from time to time over a month period 
on june   the board of directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program june program  and together with the august program  the programs to acquire the company s common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the june program  up to million of the company s common stock could be reacquired from time to time over a month period

under the august program  up to million of the company s common stock could be reacquired from time to time over a month period 
the full million remained available under the august program for stock repurchases as of december  as of december  we have a million revolving line of credit 
the line of credit expires on june  and bears interest at either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling million with an average interest rate of 
availability under the credit facility is also reduced by outstanding letters of credit  which totaled million as of december  available borrowings under the line of credit were million as of december  in addition  the credit facility includes financial and non financial covenants  with which we were in full compliance as of december  and as of the date of this report 
our capital requirements  including costs related to opening additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately million in  with the majority of expenditures associated with to full service restaurant openings 
we expect to fund all capital requirements during using operating cash flow and funds from our revolving line of credit 
additionally  we anticipate pre opening costs per restaurant to approximate  to  for a full service restaurant 
pre opening costs include rent expense incurred from the time the restaurant build out period is complete  and the restaurant is ready for its intended use  through the restaurant opening date 
any unexpected delays in construction  labor shortages or other factors could result in higher than anticipated pre opening costs 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of arrangements negotiated with landlords 

table of contents we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any vie transactions and do not otherwise have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations short term borrowings purchase obligations fin liability represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum rent based on a percentage of sales and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
purchase obligations represents estimated construction commitments and excludes agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
the lives for furniture  fixtures and equipment are five or years 
the lives for buildings and leasehold improvements are the shorter of years or the term of the related operating lease 
the cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed when incurred  while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
a reduction in the useful life of our property and equipment could increase annual depreciation expense for the related assets 
operating leases we recognize rent over a lease term that begins from the date of possession and includes the build out period  which represents the period from construction start date through the completion of construction 
rent from the date the premises were ready for their intended use through the restaurant opening date was included as 
table of contents rent expense in pre opening expenses 
however  in accordance with fsp  we expensed straight line rent from the construction start date through construction completion beginning january  tenant improvement allowances are now recognized as deferred rent credits and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense on the consolidated statements of income and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation of the purchase price of net assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
intangible assets deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we test for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at a minimum on an annual basis 
impairment tests are performed with respect to goodwill at the segment level of reporting 
the recoverability of goodwill is reviewed based primarily on a multiple of earnings analysis comparing the fair value of the reporting segment to the carrying value 
an annual assessment for impairment is performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and the analysis is performed more frequently if there are any impairment indicators identified during the year 
as of december   management determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
long lived asset impairments and store closure costs we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including restaurant sites and other assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable 
the asset impairment review process assesses the recovery of an asset based on estimated future cash flows 
management has determined that restaurants with operating cash flows of less than a defined amount should be regularly monitored to determine if impairment charges should be taken 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the related asset s carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values 
the net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset are determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of local operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
for any properties that are planned to be closed and are under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease rental that could be reasonably obtained for the property is recognized as a liability and expensed when the criteria for sfas no 
have been met 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values 
internal specialists estimate the subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation affect the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets 
self insurance our business is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile  employee health benefits and general liability costs 
we record our self insurance liability  which is determined actuarially  based on claims filed  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  statistical analyses of historical industry data  as well as our own estimates based on historical trends 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure for each of these programs 
any actuarial projection of ultimate losses is subject to a high 
table of contents degree of variability 
sources of this variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
our future funding estimates anticipate no change in the benefit structure 
statutory changes could have a significant impact on future claim costs 
our workers compensation liabilities are from claims occurring in various states 
individual state workers compensation regulations have received a tremendous amount of attention from state politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting our business 
the changes in state political and economic environments increase the variability in unpaid claim liabilities 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions including those that may result from the american jobs creation act of  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  fin prescribes recognition and measurement criteria in addition to classification  interim period accounting and significantly expanded disclosure provisions for uncertain tax positions that are expected to be taken in our corporate tax return 
restaurant  franchise revenues and other revenues revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
all fees from franchised operations are included in revenue as earned 
royalty fees are based on franchised restaurants revenues and we record these fees in the period the related franchised restaurants revenues are earned 
royalty fees from our licensing agreement with kraft are recognized on a quarterly basis and are based on a percentage of kraft s sales of our premium frozen pizzas 
revenues from the sale of electronic gift cards are recognized when the electronic gift cards are redeemed 
pre opening costs we follow statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which was issued by the accounting standards executive committee and provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred as a charge against operations 
stock based compensation effective january  we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options and restricted stock awards 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and  as a result  did not retroactively adjust results from prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation is recognized for expense related to the remaining nonvested portion of all stock awards granted prior to 
table of contents january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and expense related to all stock awards granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the black scholes valuation model is applied in determining the fair value of option awards  which is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of stock based compensation 
new accounting standards the fasb recently issued several new accounting standards 
the statements relevant to our line of business and the impact on us are as follows in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  the company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company has not yet determined the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the consolidated financial statements 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities when held 
cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than three months as of the date of purchase 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in market prices related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of december  we had million in cash and no marketable securities 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have a million line of credit agreement with bank of america  na that expires on june  interest on the line of credit is calculated on either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
as of december   we had borrowings under the credit facility totaling million with an average interest rate of 
changes in interest rates could affect the interest expense on these loans and  therefore  impact our prospective cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of no more than one year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
