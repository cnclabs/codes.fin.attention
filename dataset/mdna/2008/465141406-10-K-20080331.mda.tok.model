overview isramco  inc  a delaware corporation  is active in the exploration of oil and gas in the united states 
isramco acts as an operator of certain leases and licenses and also holds participation interests in certain other interests 
critical accounting policies estimation of oil and gas reserves is important to the effective management of isramco 
they are integral to making investment decisions about oil and gas properties such as whether development should proceed or enhanced recovery methods should be undertaken 
oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
oil and gas reserves are divided between proved and unproved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
unproved reserves are those with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and are classified as either probable or possible 
the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines 
although isramco is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset costs are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
isramco accounts for impairments under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  isramco compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on isramco and third party s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
isramco records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while isramco has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that isramco were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
isramco does not participate in  nor has it created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
isramco records a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long live assets 
at least annually  the company reassesses the obligation to determine whether a change in the estimated obligation is necessary 
the company evaluates whether there are indicators that suggest the estimated cash flows underlying the obligation have materially changed 
should those indicators suggest the estimated obligation may have materially changed the company will accordingly update its assessment 
liquidity and capital resources isramco finances its operations primarily from cash generated by operations 
isramco s operating activities provided used net cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the availability of cash generated by operations could be affected by other business risks discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report 
working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the current maturities of long term debt and derivative liability 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities in is primarily attributable to the purchase of oil and gas wells through the acquisition of five states assets 
capital expenditures for property and equipment were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures in and were primarily attributable to the drilling of oil and gas wells in the united states 
results of operation year ended december  compared to year ended december  isramco reported net loss from continuing operations of  in loss of per share compared to net income from continuing operations of  gain of per share in the decrease in the net income in compared to is primarily attributable to i an increase in net loss on derivative contracts of  compare to a net gain of  in ii an impairment of  as results of the sale of the land in israel iii increase of  of impairment of oil and gas assets due to low production of gas wells drilled to the barnett shale iv an increase in interest expenses of  compare to interest income of  in v compensation for legal settlement of  that recorded in  all of which partially offset by increasing of oil and gas operating income  realized gain on sale of investment in high tech company  and income tax benefit

operator s fees in isramco earned  in operator fees compared to  in oil and gas revenues in and isramco had oil and gas revenues of  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the purchase of oil and gas wells through the acquisition of five states assets  partially offset by a decline in production from the company s older wells and shutdown of certain production in one of the fields due to unanticipated pipeline maintenance 
lease operating expenses and severance taxes lease operating expenses and severance taxes were incurred primarily in connection with oil and gas fields in the united states 
oil and gas lease operating expenses and severance taxes were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the purchase of oil and gas wells through the acquisition of five states assets 
interest expenses during  total debt increased  to  the increase is primarily attributable to loans that were taken to finance the five states acquisition see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest expenses during the year ended december  were  compared to interest income of  for the year ended december  the increase in interest expenses in is primarily attributable to interest on loans that were taken to finance the five states acquisition while the income in is primarily attributable to earned on interest bearing on marketable securities held by the company 
gain on marketable securities in  isramco recognized net realized and unrealized gain on marketable securities of  compared to net realized and unrealized gain on marketable securities of  in increases or decreases in the gains and losses from marketable securities are dependent on the market prices in general and the composition of the portfolio of isramco 
general and administrative expenses in isramco incurred  in general and administrative expenses compared to  including operator expenses in the increase is primarily due to the five states acquisition which increased the volume of the activities and as a result the indirect expenses such as auditor s fee  wages  consultants and rent 
equity in earning of unconsolidated affiliates isramco s equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for was  compared to  for the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in the gain of marketable securities held by the limited partnerships isramco negev and ioc dead sea lp  affiliates of isramco 
depreciation  depletion amortization dd a and impairment depreciation  depletion amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
isramco s dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact isramco s composite dd a rate and expense  such as field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance  and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause isramco s composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
during  isramco recorded depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses of  compared to  in the main reason for the increase is the increase of the company s oil and gas assets in united states due to the acquisition of five states assets 
impairments include amortization of unproved leases  as well as impairments under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on estimate future cash flow 
impairments of  in were  higher than the increase in the impairment on is mainly due to the low volume of gas produced in the wells that the company participated on the barnett in parker county 
realized gain on sale of investment and capital gain in april  isramtecc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sold part of its equity interests in high tech company  for aggregate consideration of  net of commission 
as a result of the transaction  the company recorded a one time non recurring net gain of  net loss on derivative contracts from time to time  isramco enters into derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on anticipated oil and natural gas production 
under price swaps  the company is required to make payments to  or receive payments from  the counterparties based upon the differential between a specified fixed price and a price related to those quoted on the new york mercantile exchange for each respective period 
the company elected not to designate any positions as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes for the years ended december   and accordingly  the company records the net change in the mark to market valuation of these derivative contracts in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other income and expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a net derivative loss of million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  isramco reported income from continuing operations of  gain of per share in compared to income from continuing operation of  loss of per share in the increase in the net income in compared to is primarily attributable to i an increase in the gain of marketable securities  ii an increase in the net income of investees  iii an increase in other income due to recording of non recurring one time receipt of  for the settlement of certain lawsuit that were initiated by isramco and income related to mark to market of swap contracts on oil and gas prices
