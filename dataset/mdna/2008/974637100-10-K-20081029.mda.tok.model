item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview winnebago industries  inc is a leading motor home manufacturer with a proud history of manufacturing recreation vehicles for the last years 
for calendar year through august   we led the industry in combined retail unit market share with percent of class a and class c motor homes in the us we began producing class b motor homes during the second half of our fiscal  and in the us have a percent retail unit market share through august  in canada  we also led the industry in retail unit market share  with percent through july  our strategy is to manufacture quality motor homes in a profitable manner 
we produce all of our motor homes in highly vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in the state of iowa 
we distribute our product through independent dealers throughout the united states and canada  who then retail the product to the end consumer 
all of the retail unit market share information provided in this paragraph is according to statistical surveys  inc company and business outlook the rv industry saw a reduction in wholesale motor home shipments during fiscal that significantly deteriorated in the last half of our fiscal year 
this dynamic is evidenced in the table below wholesale shipments in units decrease of decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year as reported by rvia 
class a  class b and class c shipments 
data has been adjusted to coincide with our quarter endings 
the sharp decline in wholesale shipments was a direct result of the extremely soft retail market 
as reported by statistical surveys  inc  industry retail registrations for class a and class c motor homes were down in our first quarter  in our second quarter  in our third quarter and in our fourth quarter 
the motorized market has been significantly impacted by highly unstable market conditions 
the tightening of the wholesale and retail credit markets  low consumer confidence  and the uncertainty of fuel prices are placing pressure on retail sales and our dealers continue to be cautious in the amount of inventory they are willing to carry 
dealers continue to sell older model year units and are increasingly not reordering inventory on a one for one basis  which negatively affects shipments and backlog 
the decline in wholesale and retail demand has directly impacted our gross margins as we have produced and delivered far fewer units in recent quarters and also we have had to increase our discounts to meet competitive pricing and provide retail incentives to help dealers move inventory 
order backlog for our motor homes was as follows year ended in units august  product mix august  product mix decrease increase change class a gas class a diesel total class a class b class c total backlog total approximate revenue dollars in thousands dealer inventory units fiscal year ended august  contained weeks  fiscal year ended august  contained weeks 
we include in our backlog all accepted purchase orders from dealers to be shipped within the next six months 
orders in backlog can be canceled or postponed at the option of the purchaser at any time without penalty and  therefore  backlog may not necessarily be an accurate measure of future sales 

table of contents when retail credit availability and consumer confidence improve  we expect to see a rebound in sales from dealers ordering units for stock and expect to benefit from our ability to ramp up production 
a longer term positive outlook for the recreation vehicle industry is supported by favorable demographics as baby boomers reach the age where they historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales  and an increase in interest in the rv lifestyle among both older and younger segments of the population than have traditionally participated
