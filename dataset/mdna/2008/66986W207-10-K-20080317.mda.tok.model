in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors  the introductory paragraph to part i  and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we consider our core business to be the ownership and operation of ambulatory surgery centers ascs 
as of december   we owned and operated ascs of which were jointly owned with physician partners

operating cash flow of million 
asc strategy 
we measure the success of our asc strategy based on our ability to achieve or exceed the following key objectives acquire and develop new ascs 
we consider the acquisition and development of new ascs a key element of our long term growth strategy 
we currently have five employees dedicated to identifying and analyzing acquisition and development opportunities 
strengthen and build relationships with existing and new physician partners 
our physician partners play a significant role in the success of our ascs 
we share a common goal with our physician partners which is to operate efficient  productive and profitable ascs 
our objective is to own greater than of each asc but less than 
continue to increase revenue and improve operating margins in our existing ascs 
the primary source of revenue at our ascs is derived from surgical procedures performed 
profitable growth within our existing ascs is determined by our ability to maximize efficiency and utilization  expand into medical procedures beyond eye care  and provide quality service to our physicians and their patients 
in addition to the above key asc objectives  our overall strategy also includes maintaining a strong balance sheet  continuing to grow the other segments of our business  and attracting and retaining employees to help us achieve our growth objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  net of allowances 
revenue from surgical procedures performed at our surgical facilities and patient visits to our eye care practices  net of contractual allowances and a provision for doubtful accounts  is recognized at the time the service is performed 
the contractual allowance is the difference between the fee we charge and the amount we expect to be paid by the patient or the applicable third party payor  which includes medicare and private insurance 
we base our estimates for the contractual allowance on the medicare reimbursement rates when medicare is the payor  our contracted rate with other third party payors or our historical experience when we do not have a specific medicare or contracted rate 
we base our estimate for doubtful accounts on the aging category and our historical collection experience 
our optical products purchasing organization negotiates buying discounts with optical product manufacturers 
the buying discounts and any handling charges billed to the members of the purchasing organization represent the revenue recognized 
product sales revenue from our optical laboratories and marketing products and services business  net of an allowance for returns and discounts  is recognized when the product is shipped or service is provided to the customer 
we base our estimates for sales returns and discounts on historical experience and have not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated and actual return activity and discounts given 
accounts receivable have been reduced by the reserves for estimated contractual allowances and doubtful accounts noted above 
asset impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of our fixed assets  goodwill and other noncurrent assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
we calculate fair value by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the option 
we also estimate the expected service period over which our stock based awards will vest 
each of these assumptions  while reasonable  requires a certain degree of judgment and the fair value estimates could vary if actual results are materially different than those initially applied 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net revenue for the years indicated

net revenue by segment is discussed below 
surgical facilities 
the table below summarizes surgical facilities net revenue and procedures performed for and net revenues generated from surgical facilities are derived from the fees charged for the procedures performed in our ascs and through our laser services agreements 
our procedure volume is directly impacted by the number of ascs we operate  the number of excimer lasers in service  and their respective utilization rates 
surgical facilities net revenue increased by from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of a million increase from ascs we acquired or developed after january  new ascs and a million  or  increase from ascs that we owned for the entire comparable reporting periods same facility 
the increase in same facility net revenue was primarily the result of a increase in the number of same facility procedures performed offset by a decrease in the net revenue per procedure due to a change in procedure mix 
dollars in thousands increase decrease surgical facilities same facility net revenue    of procedures    new ascs net revenue    of procedures    asc closure laser terminations net revenue   of procedures   on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a final rule establishing the policies for the revised payment system for services provided in ascs 
the asc rates  which were published on november   will be approximately of the hospital outpatient department payment rates  as compared to in the proposed rule announced on august  in addition  the revised rates are scheduled to phase in evenly over four years beginning january  and in the rates will be adjusted annually based on changes in the consumer price index for urban consumers 
we estimate that the impact of the final rule  based on our current procedure mix  payor mix and volume  will be neutral to earnings per share 
on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of this legislation required cms to limit medicare reimbursements for surgical procedures furnished in ascs to the amount paid to a hospital for the same service effective for services furnished on and after january  the most significant impact to us from this legislation was the reduction in the medicare facility fee for the after cataract laser surgery procedure  which is also known as the yag procedure 
we estimate that the negative impact from the decreased medicare facility fee paid for these procedures in was a reduction of approximately million in net surgical facilities revenue 
this equates to an estimated negative impact in earnings per share of approximately in the success of our business depends on our relationship with  and the success and efforts of  the physicians who perform surgical procedures at our ascs 
our revenue and profitability would decline if our relationship with key physicians deteriorated or those physicians reduced or eliminated their use of our ascs

discontinued operations 
on december   our board of directors approved a plan to close or sell three majority owned ascs located in columbus  georgia  laredo  texas and thibodaux  louisiana 
prior to reporting these ascs as discontinued operations  they represented approximately of our consolidated net revenue and a net loss of approximately per diluted share in the board determined to close or sell the columbus  georgia and laredo  texas ascs due to their continued unprofitability 
the thibodaux  louisiana asc only has one surgeon who is planning to retire shortly 
the decision to close or sell this asc was based on the asc s competitive position in the market  limited growth potential  and the lack of a succession plan for the surgeon in this rural area 
subsequent to the decision to sell or close the ascs above  we completed the sale of the columbus  georgia asc 
the company received net sale proceeds of million and recorded a net loss on disposal of the asc of million during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net loss on the pending divestiture of the laredo  texas asc of million

considering the procedures performed in our ascs in and prior years  the most significant impact to us from this legislation will be the reduction in the medicare facility fee for the after cataract laser surgery procedure  which is also known as the yag procedure 
based on the number of yag procedures performed in our ascs during the fourth quarter of  we estimate that the annual impact from the decreased medicare facility fee paid for these procedures is a reduction of approximately million to million in net surgical facilities revenue 
this would equate to an estimated negative impact in earnings per share of between and 
to the extent that other payors  governmental and private  adopt this practice  the impact could be greater

the convertible notes include a net share settlement feature that requires us to settle conversion of the notes in cash up to the notes principal amount and settle any excess of the convertible notes conversion value above their principal amount by delivering shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of cash and common stock  at our option 
as a result of the net share settlement feature  we will be able to substantially reduce the number of shares issuable in the event of the conversion of the convertible notes by repaying principal in cash instead of issuing shares of common stock for that amount 
additionally  we will not be required to include the underlying shares of common stock in the calculation of our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for earnings per share until our common stock price exceeds 
during a public meeting held july   the financial accounting standards board fasb indicated that it would change the accounting for net share settled convertible debt 
the proposed change would result in us recording interest expense on the convertible notes in an amount greater than the current coupon rate

we also sold warrants to the counterparty to purchase from us an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and received proceeds of million 
taken together  the call option and warrant agreements have the effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the convertible notes to per share 
for a further discussion of the convertible notes and the related call options and warrants see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and were in compliance with all of our covenants 
effective february   we amended our credit facility  increasing the maximum commitment available under the facility from million to million and extending the expiration date to february  the maximum commitment available under the facility is the lesser of million or the maximum allowed under the calculated ratio limitations 
the amended credit agreement also includes an option allowing us to increase the maximum commitment available to million under certain conditions 
maximum borrowing availability and applicable interest rates under the facility are based on a ratio of our total indebtedness to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides for temporary increases in this ratio through september  for purposes of calculating our maximum borrowing availability 
interest on borrowings under the facility is payable at an annual rate equal to our lender s published base rate plus the applicable borrowing margin ranging from to or libor plus a range from to  varying depending upon our ratios and ability to meet other financial covenants 
in addition  a fee ranging from 
to

the weighted average interest rate on credit line borrowings at december  was 
during  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps protect us against certain interest rate fluctuations of the libor rate on million of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
the date of the first interest rate swap was april   and it expires on april  this interest rate swap effectively fixes our libor rate on million of variable rate debt at a rate of

as of december  and  working capital was million and million  respectively 
we expect our cash flow from operations and funds available under our existing credit facility to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the timing and size of our acquisition  development and expansion activities  capital requirements associated with our surgical facilities  and the future cost of surgical equipment

the thibodaux  louisiana asc only has one surgeon who is planning to retire shortly 
the decision to close or sell this asc was based on the asc s competitive position in the market  limited growth potential  and the lack of a succession plan for the surgeon in this rural area 
for a further discussion of discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we had an option to purchase an additional equity interest from our physician partner in our ft 
lauderdale  florida asc to enable us to increase our interest in the asc to a majority equity interest 
because we did not exercise this option by july  we have exercised our option to sell our minority interest to our physician partner for the original price paid 
the sale of this interest has not yet occurred 
two partners in our richmond  virginia asc who each own a equity interest have the option to sell us back their interest at the same price they paid to acquire their interest

recent accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january  fin 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million during no adjustment was made to the beginning retained earnings balance  as the ultimate deductibility of all these tax positions was judged to be highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility 
no interest or penalties have been accrued relative to these positions since we have either a tax loss or have utilized a net operating loss carryforward to offset any taxable income in all subject years 
deferred tax assets have been recorded to recognize the future benefits of the positions reserved for in the fin liability 
because of the impact of deferred income tax accounting  the temporary differences would not affect the annual effective tax rate
