for purposes of business segment reporting  we have aligned operations with similar characteristics into two business segments radio and television 
the radio segment includes twenty three markets  which includes all ninety one of our radio stations and five radio information networks 
the television segment includes three markets and consists of five television stations and four low power television lptv stations 

table of contents for more information regarding our reportable segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
strategy our strategy is to operate top billing radio and television stations in mid sized markets  which we define as markets ranked from to out of the markets summarized by investing in radio market report and investing in television market report 
based on the most recent information available  of our fm radio stations that subscribe to independent ratings services were ranked number one by number of listeners in their target demographic markets  and of our television stations were ranked number one by number of viewers  in their markets 
programming and marketing are key components in our strategy to achieve top ratings in both our radio and television operations 
in many of our markets  the three or four most highly rated stations radio and or television receive a disproportionately high share of the market s advertising revenues 
as a result  a station s revenue is dependent upon its ability to maximize its number of listeners viewers within an advertiser s given demographic parameters 
in certain cases we use attributes other than specific market listener data for sales activities 
in those markets where sufficient alternative data is available  we do not subscribe to an independent listener rating service 
the radio stations that we own and or operate employ a variety of programming formats  including classic hits  adult contemporary  classic rock  news talk  country and classical 
we regularly perform extensive market research  including music evaluations  focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies 
our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following 
the television stations that we own and or operate are comprised of two cbs affiliates  one abc affiliate  two fox affiliates  one univision affiliate  one nbc affiliate  one mytv affiliate and one telemundo affiliate 
in addition to securing network programming  we carefully select available syndicated programming to maximize viewership 
we also develop local programming  including a strong local news franchise in each of our television markets 
we concentrate on the development of strong decentralized local management  which is responsible for the day to day operations of the stations we own and or operate 
we compensate local management based on the station s financial performance  as well as other performance factors that are deemed to affect the long term ability of the stations to achieve financial performance objectives 
corporate management is responsible for long range planning  establishing policies and procedures  resource allocation and monitoring the activities of the stations 
we actively seek and explore opportunities for expansion through the acquisition of additional broadcast properties 
under the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act  we are permitted to own as many as radio stations in a single market 
see federal regulation of radio and television broadcasting 
we seek to acquire reasonably priced broadcast properties with significant growth potential that are located in markets with well established and relatively stable economies 
we often focus on local economies supported by a strong presence of state or federal government or one or more major universities 
future acquisitions will be subject to the availability of financing and compliance with the communications act of the communications act and fcc rules 
we review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis 
advertising sales our primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
depending on the format of a particular radio station  there are a predetermined number of advertisements broadcast each hour 
the number of advertisements broadcast on our television stations may be limited by certain network affiliation and syndication agreements and  with respect to children s programs  federal regulation 
we determine the number of advertisements broadcast hourly that can maximize a station s available revenue dollars without jeopardizing listening viewing levels 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the 
table of contents number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
any change in our revenue  with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold  is generally the result of pricing adjustments  which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory 
advertising rates charged by radio and television stations are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  the number of stations in the market competing for the same demographic group  the supply of and demand for radio and television advertising time  and other qualitative factors including rates charged by competing radio and television stations within a given market 
radio rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon drive time hours  while television advertising rates are generally higher during prime time evening viewing periods 
most advertising contracts are short term  generally running for only a few weeks 
this allows broadcasters the ability to modify advertising rates as dictated by changes in station ownership within a market  changes in listener viewer ratings and changes in the business climate within a particular market 
approximately  or of our gross revenue for the year ended december  approximately  or in fiscal and approximately  or in fiscal was generated from the sale of local advertising 
additional revenue is generated from the sale of national advertising  network compensation payments  barter and other miscellaneous transactions 
in all of our markets  we attempt to maintain a local sales force that is generally larger than our competitors 
the principal goal in our sales efforts is to develop long standing customer relationships through frequent direct contacts  which we believe represents a competitive advantage 
we also typically provide incentives to our sales staff to seek out new opportunities resulting in the establishment of new client relationships  as well as new sources of revenue  not directly associated with the sale of broadcast time 
each of our stations also engage independent national sales representatives to assist us in obtaining national advertising revenues 
these representatives obtain advertising through national advertising agencies and receive a commission from us based on our net revenue from the advertising obtained 
total gross revenue resulting from national advertising in fiscal was approximately  or of our gross revenue approximately  or in fiscal and approximately  or in fiscal 
competition both radio and television broadcasting are highly competitive businesses 
our stations compete for listeners viewers and advertising revenues directly with other radio and or television stations  as well as other media  within their markets 
our radio and television stations compete for listeners viewers primarily on the basis of program content and by employing on air talent which appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong listener viewer base comprised of a specific demographic group in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach these listeners viewers 
other media  including broadcast television and or radio as applicable  cable television  newspapers  magazines  direct mail  the internet  coupons and billboard advertising  also compete with us for advertising revenues 
the radio and television broadcasting industries are also subject to competition from new media technologies  such as the delivery of audio programming by cable and satellite television systems  satellite radio systems  direct reception from satellites  and streaming of audio on the internet 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  any of these new technologies may have on us or the broadcasting industry 
seasonality our revenue varies throughout the year 
advertising expenditures  our primary source of revenue  is generally lowest in the first quarter 

table of contents employees as of december   we had approximately full time employees and part time employees  none of whom are represented by unions 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
we employ several high profile personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets 
we have entered into employment and non competition agreements with our president and with most of our on air personalities  as well as non competition agreements with our commissioned sales representatives

federal regulation of radio and television broadcasting introduction 
the ownership  operation and sale of radio and television stations  including those licensed to us  are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc  which acts under authority granted by the communications act 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations and operating power of stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies station licenses  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates equipment used by stations  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations  and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the communications act 
for additional information on the impact of fcc regulations and the introduction of new technologies on our operations  see forward looking statements  risk factors below 
the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and of specific fcc regulations and policies 
reference should be made to the communications act  fcc rules and the public notices and rulings of the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations 
license renewal 
radio and television broadcasting licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years  and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
under its two step renewal process  the fcc must grant a renewal application if it finds that during the preceding term the licensee has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  and there have been no serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
if a renewal applicant fails to meet these standards  the fcc may either deny its application or grant the application on such terms and conditions as are appropriate  including renewal for less than the full year term 
in making the determination of whether to renew the license  the fcc may not consider whether the public interest would be served by the grant of a license to a person other than the renewal applicant 
if the fcc  after notice and opportunity for a hearing  finds that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements for renewal and no mitigating factors justify the imposition of lesser sanctions  the fcc may issue an order denying the renewal application  and only thereafter may the fcc accept applications for a construction permit specifying the broadcasting facilities of the former licensee 
petitions may be filed to deny the renewal applications of our stations  but any such petitions must raise issues that would cause the fcc to deny a renewal application under the standards adopted in the two step renewal process 
we have filed applications to renew the company s radio and television station licenses  as necessary  and we intend to timely file renewal applications  as required for the company s stations 
under the communications act  if a broadcast station fails to transmit signals for any consecutive month period  the fcc license expires at the end of that period  unless the fcc exercises its discretion to extend or reinstate the license to promote equity and fairness 
the fcc  to date  has refused to exercise such discretion

an application for renewal of license is pending before the fcc 
ownership matters 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant or renew a broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee  including compliance with the communications act s limitations on alien ownership  compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of broadcast  cable and newspaper properties  and the character and other qualifications of the licensee and those persons holding attributable or cognizable interests therein 
under the communications act  broadcast licenses may not be granted to any corporation having more than one fifth of its issued and outstanding capital stock owned or voted by aliens including non us corporations  foreign governments or their representatives collectively  aliens 
the communications act also prohibits a corporation  without fcc waiver  from holding a broadcast license if that corporation is controlled  directly or indirectly  by another corporation in which more than of the issued and outstanding capital 
table of contents stock is owned or voted by aliens 
the fcc has issued interpretations of existing law under which these restrictions in modified form apply to other forms of business organizations  including partnerships 
since we serve as a holding company for our various radio station subsidiaries  we cannot have more than of our stock owned or voted by aliens 
the communications act and fcc rules also generally prohibit or restrict the common ownership  operation or control of a radio broadcast station and a television broadcast station serving the same geographic market 
in its quadrennial regulatory review  released february   the fcc adopted a presumption  in the top designated market areas dmas  that it is not inconsistent with the public interest for one entity to own a daily newspaper and a radio station or  under the following limited circumstances  a daily newspaper and a television station  if the television station is not ranked among the top four stations in the dma and at least eight independent major media voices remain in the dma 
in all other instances  the fcc adopted a presumption that a newspaper broadcast station combination would not be in the public interest  with two limited exceptions  and emphasized that the commission is unlikely to approve such transactions 
taking into account these respective presumptions  in determining whether the grant of a transaction that would result in newspaper broadcast cross ownership is in the public interest  the commission will consider the following factors whether the cross ownership will increase the amount of local news disseminated through the affected media outlets in the combination  whether each affected media outlet in the combination will exercise its own independent news judgment  the level of concentration in the nielsen dma  and the financial condition of the newspaper or broadcast outlet  and if the newspaper or broadcast station is in financial distress  the proposed owner s commitment to invest significantly in newsroom operations 
the fcc established criteria for obtaining a waiver of the rules to permit the ownership of two television stations in the same dma that would not otherwise comply with the fcc s rules 
under certain circumstances  a television station may merge with a failed or failing station or an unbuilt station if strict criteria are satisfied 
additionally  the fcc now permits a party to own up to two television stations if permitted under the modified tv duopoly rule and up to six radio stations if permitted under the local radio ownership rules  or one television station and up to seven radio stations  in any market where at least independently owned media voices remain in the market after the combination is effected qualifying market 
the fcc will permit the common ownership of up to two television stations and four radio stations in any market where at least independently owned media voices remain after the combination is effected 
the fcc will permit the common ownership of up to two television stations and one radio station notwithstanding the number of voices in the market 
the fcc also adopted rules that make television time brokerage agreements or tba s count as if the brokered station were owned by the brokering station in making a determination of compliance with the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
tba s entered into before november   are grandfathered until the fcc announces a required termination date 
as a result of the fcc s rules  we would not be permitted to acquire a television broadcast station other than low power television in a non qualifying market in which we now own any television properties 
the fcc revised its rules to permit a television station to affiliate with two or more major networks of television broadcast stations under certain conditions 
major existing networks are still subject to the fcc s dual network ban 
we are permitted to own an unlimited number of radio stations on a nationwide basis subject to the local ownership restrictions described below 
we are permitted to own an unlimited number of television stations on a nationwide basis so long as the ownership of the stations would not result in an aggregate national audience reach ie  the total number of television households in the arbitron area of dominant influence adi markets in which the relevant stations are located divided by the total national television households as measured by adi data at the time of a grant  transfer or assignment of a license of 
this so called national television station ownership rule was appealed to the court  and on february   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit remanded the rule to the fcc for further consideration and vacated outright a related rule that prohibited a cable television system from carrying the signal of any television station it owned in the same local market 
as a result  on july   the fcc released a report and order and notice of proposed rulemaking in mb docket no 
that 
table of contents significantly modified the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
the multiple ownership rules now permit opportunities for newspaper broadcast combinations  as follows in markets with three or fewer tv stations  no cross ownership is permitted among tv  radio and newspapers 
a company may obtain a waiver of that ban if it can show that the television station does not serve the area served by the cross owned property ie the radio station or the newspaper 
in markets with between and tv stations  combinations are limited to one of the following a a daily newspaper  one tv station  and up to half of the radio station limit for that market ie if the radio limit in the market is  the company can only own or b a daily newspaper  and up to the radio station limit for that market  ie no tv stations or c two tv stations if permissible under local tv ownership rule  and up to the radio station limit for that market ie no daily newspapers 
in markets with nine or more tv stations  the fcc eliminated the newspaper broadcast cross ownership ban and the television radio cross ownership ban 
under the rules  the number of radio stations one party may own in a local arbitron rated radio market is determined by the number of commercial and noncommercial radio stations in the market as determined by arbitron and bia financial  inc radio markets that are not arbitron rated are determined by analysis of the broadcast coverage contours of the radio stations involved 
numerous parties  including the company  have sought reconsideration of the new rules 
in prometheus radio v 
fcc  case no 
 on september   the us court of appeals for the third circuit granted a stay of the effective date of the fcc s new rules 
on june   the court remanded the case to the fcc for the fcc to justify or modify its approach to setting numerical limits and for the fcc to reconsider or better explain its decision to repeal the failed station solicitation rule  and lifted its stay on the effect of the new radio multiple ownership rules 
by further notice of proposed rule making quadrennial regulatory review  released july   the commission solicited comments 
the only changes made to the multiple ownership rules in the quadrennial regulatory review  were to the local television multiple ownership rule as noted above 
the new rules could restrict the company s ability to acquire additional radio and television stations in some markets and could require the company to terminate its arrangements with surtsey media  llc 
the court and fcc proceedings are ongoing and we cannot predict what action  if any  the court may take or what action the fcc may take to further modify its rules 
the statements herein are based solely on the fcc s multiple ownership rules in effect as of the date hereof and do not include any forward looking statements concerning compliance with any future multiple ownership rules 
under the communications act  we are permitted to own radio stations without regard to the audience shares of the stations based upon the number of radio stations in the relevant radio market as follows number of stations in radio market number of stations we can own or fewer total of stations  not more than in the same service am or fm  except the company cannot own more than of the stations in the market 
total of stations  not more than in the same service am or fm 
total of stations  not more than in the same service am or fm 
or more total of stations  not more than in the same service am or fm 
the fcc has eliminated its previous scrutiny of some proposed acquisitions and mergers on antitrust grounds that was manifest in a policy of placing a flag soliciting public comment on concentration of control issues based on advertising revenue shares or other criteria  on the public notice announcing the acceptance of assignment and transfer applications 
notwithstanding this action  we cannot predict whether the fcc will adopt rules that would restrict our ability to acquire additional stations 

table of contents new rules to be promulgated under the communications act may permit us to own  operate  control or have a cognizable interest in additional radio broadcast stations if the fcc determines that such ownership  operation  control or cognizable interest will result in an increase in the number of radio stations in operation 
no firm date has been established for initiation of this rule making proceeding 
in april  the fcc issued a report and order resolving a proceeding in which it sought comment on the procedures it should use to license non reserved broadcast channels ie  those fm channels not specifically reserved for noncommercial use in which both commercial and noncommercial educational nce entities have an interest 
the fcc adopted a proposal to allow applicants for nce stations to submit applications for non reserved spectrum in a filing window  subject to being returned as unacceptable for filing if there is any mutually exclusive application for a commercial station  and to allow applicants for am stations and secondary services a prior opportunity to resolve their mutually exclusive applications through settlements 
applicants for nce stations in the full power fm and tv services also have an opportunity to reserve channels at the allocation stage of the licensing process for use of those channels  however  this opportunity is not available to commercial applicants such as the company 
the fcc generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association 
in the case of corporations holding broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly  have the right to vote or more of the corporation s stock or or more of such stock in the case of certain passive investors that are holding stock for investment purposes only are generally attributable  as are positions of an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee 
currently  three of our officers and directors have an attributable interest or interests in companies applying for or licensed to operate broadcast stations other than us 
in  the fcc revised its ownership attribution rules to a apply to limited liability companies and registered limited liability partnerships the same attribution rules that the fcc applies to limited partnerships  and b create a new equity debt plus edp rule that attributes the other media interests of an otherwise passive investor if the investor is a major market program supplier that supplies over of a station s total weekly broadcast programming hours  or a same market media entity subject to the fcc s multiple ownership rules including broadcasters  cable operators and newspapers so that its interest in a licensee or other media entity in that market will be attributed if that interest  aggregating both debt and equity holdings  exceeds of the total asset value equity plus debt of the licensee or media entity 
we could be prohibited from acquiring a financial interest in stations in markets where application of the edp rule would result in us having an attributable interest in the stations 
in reconsidering its rules  the fcc also eliminated the single majority shareholder exemption which provides that minority voting shares in a corporation where one shareholder controls a majority of the voting stock are not attributable  however  in december the fcc suspended the elimination of this exemption until the fcc resolved issues concerning cable television ownership 
in addition to the fcc s multiple ownership rules  the antitrust division of the united states department of justice and the federal trade commission and some state governments have the authority to examine proposed transactions for compliance with antitrust statutes and guidelines 
the antitrust division has issued civil investigative demands and obtained consent decrees requiring the divestiture of stations in a particular market based on antitrust concerns 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
licensees are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming often will be considered by the fcc when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee  although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the fcc at any time 
stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the communications act that regulate  among other things  political advertising  sponsorship identification  the advertisement of contests and lotteries  obscene and indecent broadcasts  and technical operations  including limits on radio frequency radiation 
the fcc now requires the owners of antenna supporting structures towers to register them with the fcc 
as an owner of such towers  we are subject to the registration requirements 
the children s 
table of contents television act of and the fcc s rules promulgated thereunder require television broadcasters to limit the amount of commercial matter which may be aired in children s programming to minutes per hour on weekends and minutes per hour on weekdays 
the children s television act and the fcc s rules also require each television licensee to serve  over the term of its license  the educational and informational needs of children through the licensee s programming and to present at least three hours per week of core educational programming specifically designed to serve such needs 
licensees are required to publicize the availability of this programming and to file quarterly a report with the fcc on these programs and related matters 
in its standardized and enhanced disclosure requirements for television broadcast licensee public interest obligations  released january   the commission required television stations to file on a quarterly basis  a new standardized television disclosure form setting forth in detail the average hours per week of programming devoted to  inter alia  high definition programs  national news  local news  local civic affairs  local electoral affairs  independently produced programs and public service announcements 
the form must also be posted on the television station licensee s internet web site 
it is possible that the fcc will use the data recorded on these forms to more stringently scrutinize licensees applications for renewal of their licenses  but at this time  the company cannot predict the impact  if any  this new form may have on its television stations 
television stations are required to provide closed captioning for certain video programming according to a schedule that gradually increases the amount of video programming that must be provided with captions 
on january   the commission released its report on broadcast localism and notice of proposed rulemaking in the commission s proceeding on broadcast localism which requested comment on several proposed rule changes 
those changes include  inter alia  proposals to require each broadcast licensee to convene a permanent community advisory board that would meet at least quarterly  require each station to locate its main studio in its community of license  require each station to have personnel present and on duty at all times when the station is on the air  and establish license renewal processing guidelines concerning the amount of local programming aired during the preceding license term 
if adopted  these proposals could significantly increase the amounts the company would have to expend on regulatory compliance matters 
equal employment opportunity rules 
equal employment opportunity eeo rules and policies for broadcasters prohibit discrimination by broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors 
they also require broadcasters to provide notice of job vacancies and to undertake additional outreach measures  such as job fairs and scholarship programs 
the rules mandate a three prong outreach program  ie  prong widely disseminate information concerning each full time hours or more job vacancy  except for vacancies filled in exigent circumstances  prong provide notice of each full time job vacancy to recruitment organizations that have requested such notice  and prong complete two for broadcast employment units with five to ten full time employees or that are located in smaller markets or four for employment units with more than ten full time employees located in larger markets longer term recruitment initiatives within a two year period 
these include  for example  job fairs  scholarship and internship programs  and other community events designed to inform the public as to employment opportunities in broadcasting 
the rules mandate extensive record keeping and reporting requirements 
the eeo rules are enforced through review at renewal time  at mid term for larger broadcasters  and through random audits and targeted investigations resulting from information received as to possible violations 
the fcc has not yet decided on whether and how to apply the eeo rule to part time positions 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures  the grant of short less than the full eight year renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license 
time brokerage agreements 
as is common in the industry  we have entered into what have commonly been referred to as time brokerage agreements  or tba s 
while these agreements may take varying forms  under a typical tba  separately owned and licensed radio or television stations agree to enter into cooperative arrangements of varying sorts  subject to compliance with the requirements of antitrust laws and with the fcc s rules and policies 
under these types of arrangements  separately owned stations agree to function cooperatively in terms of programming  advertising sales  and other matters  subject to the licensee of each 
table of contents station maintaining independent control over the programming and station operations of its own station 
one typical type of tba is a programming agreement between two separately owned radio or television stations serving a common service area  whereby the licensee of one station purchases substantial portions of the broadcast day on the other licensee s station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee  and sells advertising time during such program segments 
such arrangements are an extension of the concept of time brokerage agreements  under which a licensee of a station sells blocks of time on its station to an entity or entities which purchase the blocks of time and which sell their own commercial advertising announcements during the time periods in question 
the fcc s rules provide that a station purchasing brokering time on another station serving the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
as a result  under the rules  a broadcast station will not be permitted to enter into a time brokerage agreement giving it the right to purchase more than of the broadcast time  on a weekly basis  of another local station that it could not own under the local ownership rules of the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
the fcc s rules also prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than of its programming on another station in the same broadcast service ie  am am or fm fm whether it owns the stations or through a tba arrangement  where the brokered and brokering stations serve substantially the same geographic area 
the fcc s multiple ownership rules count stations brokered under a joint sales agreement jsa toward the brokering station s permissible ownership totals  as long as the brokering entity owns or has an attributable interest in one or more stations in the local market  and the joint advertising sales amount to more than of the brokered station s advertising time per week 
in a notice of proposed rulemaking in mb docket no 
 released august   the fcc sought comment from the public on whether television jsas should also be attributable to the brokering station 
the latest ownership review commenced in and the fcc has not yet released a decision in the proceeding resolving the issue of whether to attribute jsas 
the fcc adopted rules that permit  under certain circumstances  the ownership of two or more television stations in a qualifying market and requires the termination of certain non complying existing television tba s 
we currently have a television tba in the victoria  texas market with surtsey 
even though the victoria market is not a qualifying market such that the duopoly would otherwise be permissible  as discussed above  we believe that the tba is grandfathered under the fcc s rules and need not be terminated earlier than the date to be established in the ownership review proceeding 
see ownership matters above 
on march  we entered into an agreement of understanding with surtsey  whereby we have guaranteed up to  of the debt incurred by surtsey in closing on the acquisition of a construction permit for kfjx tv station in pittsburg  kansas 
in consideration for our guarantee  surtsey has entered into various agreements with us relating to the station  including a shared services agreement  technical services agreement  agreement for the sale of commercial time  option agreement and broker agreement not a tba 
under the fcc s ownership rules  we are prohibited from owning or having an attributable or cognizable interest in this station 
as noted above  if the fcc decides to attribute television jsa s  we would be required to terminate the agreement for the sale of commercial time 
other fcc requirements the v chip 
the fcc adopted methodology that will be used to send program ratings information to consumer tv receivers implementation of v chip legislation contained in the communications act 
the fcc also adopted the tv parental guidelines  developed by the industry ratings implementation group  which apply to all broadcast television programming except for news and sports 
as a part of the legislation  television station licensees are required to attach as an exhibit to their applications for license renewal a summary of written comments and suggestions received from the public and maintained by the licensee that comment on the licensee s programming characterized as violent 
digital television 
the fcc s rules provide for the conversion by all us television broadcasters to digital television dtv  including build out construction schedules  ntsc current analog system and dtv channel simulcasting  and the return of ntsc channels to the government 
the fcc has attempted to 
table of contents provide dtv coverage areas that are comparable to the ntsc service areas 
dtv licensees may use their dtv channels for a multiplicity of services such as high definition television broadcasts  multiple standard definition television broadcasts  data  audio  and other services so long as the licensee provides at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current ntsc technical standard 
our television stations have begun providing dtv service on channels separate from their ntsc channels 
our television stations are required to cease broadcasting on the ntsc channels by february   and return the ntsc channels to the government to be auctioned 
the company has constructed full  authorized dtv facilities serving at least of their analog population coverage 
on august   the fcc adopted a report and order order that implements several steps necessary for the conversion to dtv 
this order commenced a process for electing the channels on which dtv stations will operate in the future 
the company s television stations have timely filed with the fcc forms electing their preferred dtv channels 
the order also required broadcasters to include program and system information protocol psip information in their digital broadcast signals 
the order eliminated  for now  the requirement that analog and digital programs be simulcast for part of the time  clarified the digital closed captioning rules and mandated that  after an month transition period  all digital television receivers contain v chip functionality that will permit the current tv ratings system to be modified 
the deficit reduction act of has established february   as the date on which analog spectrum must be returned to the government to be auctioned 
under the act  the fcc is authorized to extend the february   deadline if one or more television stations affiliated with abc  cbs  nbc  or fox in a market are not broadcasting in dtv and the fcc determines that such stations have exercised due diligence in attempting to convert to dtv  or less than of the television households in the station s market subscribe to a multichannel video service that carries at least one dtv channel from each of the local stations in that market and less than of the television households in the market can receive dtv signals off the air using either set top converters for ntsc broadcasts or a new dtv set 
the deficit reduction act of creates a program through which households in the united states may obtain coupons that can be applied toward the purchase of digital to analog converter boxes 
at present koam tv is providing ntsc service on channel and dtv service on channel kavu tv is providing ntsc service on channel and dtv service on channel wxvt is providing ntsc operations on channel and dtv service on channel brokered station kvct is providing ntsc service on channel and dtv service on channel koam tv elected to use channel for dtv operations at the end of the digital transition and to make available to surtsey the use of channel for kfjx tv 
the company s and surtsey s requests to implement this election are pending before the fcc 
kavu tv elected to use channel wxvt elected to use channel kvct elected to use channel we will timely file applications with the fcc for construction permits to authorize koam tv to operate on channel for dtv and wxvt to operate on channel for dtv 
on january   the fcc adopted rules on how the law requiring the carriage of television signals on local cable television systems should apply to dtv signals 
the fcc decided that a dtv only station could immediately assert its right to carriage on a local cable television system  however  the fcc decided that a television station may not assert a right to carriage of both its ntsc and dtv channels 
on february   the fcc affirmed its conclusion 
in october  the fcc adopted rules requiring plug and play cable compatibility that will allow consumers to plug their cable directly into their digital tv set without the need for a set top box 
the fcc has adopted rules whereby television licensees are charged a fee of of gross revenue derived from the offering of ancillary or supplementary services on dtv spectrum for which a subscription fee is charged 
licensees and permittees of dtv stations must file with the fcc a report by december of each year describing such services 
none of the company s stations to date are offering ancillary or supplementary services on their dtv channels 
low power and class a television stations 
currently  the service areas of low power television lptv stations are not protected 
lptv stations can be required to terminate their operations if they cause interference to full power stations 
lptv stations meeting certain criteria were permitted to certify to the fcc their eligibility to be reclassified as class a television stations whose signal contours would be protected against interference from other stations 
stations deemed class a stations by the fcc would thus be protected from interference 
we own four operating lptv stations  kunu lp  kvtx lp  kxts lp  and kmol lp  victoria  texas 
none of the stations qualifies under the fcc s established criteria for class a 
table of contents status 
in its report on broadcast localism and notice of proposed rule making  released january   the commission tentatively concluded that it should allow additional qualified lptv stations to be granted class a status  and sought comment on this tentative conclusion 
in january  the fcc announced a filing window from may through may   during which analog lptv stations may apply for a digital companion channel or implement dtv operation on their existing analog channels 
the company s lptv stations did not apply for a companion channel  and instead  intend to flash cut to implement dtv operation on their existing analog channels 
the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  among other matters  requires cable television system operators to carry the signals of local commercial and non commercial television stations and certain low power television stations 
cable television operators and other multi channel video programming distributors may not carry broadcast signals without  in certain circumstances  obtaining the transmitting station s consent 
a local television broadcaster must make a choice every three years whether to proceed under the must carry rules or waive the right to mandatory uncompensated coverage and negotiate a grant of retransmission consent in exchange for consideration from the cable system operator 
as noted above  such must carry rights will extend to the new dtv signal to be broadcast by our stations  but will not extend simultaneously to the analog signal 
low power fm radio 
the fcc created a low power radio service lpfm in which the fcc authorizes the construction and operation of two classes of noncommercial educational fm stations  lp up to watts effective radiated power erp with antenna height above average terrain haat at up to meters feet which is calculated to produce a service area radius of approximately miles  and lp up to watts erp and up to meters haat with a service area radius of approximately to miles 
the fcc will not permit any broadcaster or other media entity subject to the fcc s ownership rules to control or hold an attributable interest in an lpfm station or enter into related operating agreements with an lpfm licensee 
thus  absent a waiver  we could not own or program an lpfm station 
lpfm stations are allocated throughout the fm broadcast band  ie  to mhz  although they must operate with a noncommercial format 
the fcc has established allocation rules that require fm stations to be separated by specified distances to other stations on the same frequency  and stations on frequencies on the first  second and third channels adjacent to the center frequency 
the fcc has granted construction permits and licenses for lpfm stations 
on december   the fcc released its third report and order and second further notice of proposed rulemaking that modified some rules and sought comment on proposed rules 
in its third report and order  the fcc revised its rules to permit certain ownership changes  to extend on a showing of good cause up to months the period in which a lpfm station must be constructed  to limit ownership of lpfm stations to one licensee each and to require lpfm operators to provide service to their local communities 
the fcc also modified its application processing standards it will apply to full service station modification applications where the modification would place an lpfm station at risk of displacement and no alternate channel is available 
in such circumstances  the fcc will consider waiving the commission s rule making lpfm stations secondary to subsequently authorized full service stations and denying the modification application to protect an lpfm station that is demonstrably serving the need of the public from being required to cease operations 
the fcc stated that where an lpfm station will be displaced by a full power fm station and no alternative channel will be available  the commission will generally favor grant of the full service station modification application 
however  the fcc applied a presumption that the public interest would be better served by a waiver of the fcc rule making lpfm stations secondary to subsequently authorized full service stations and the dismissal of an encroaching community of license reallotment application when the threatened lpfm station can demonstrate that it has regularly provided at least eight hours per day of locally originated programming  as that term is defined for the lpfm service 
this presumption will apply only under certain specified conditions  but application of this rule could limit the company s options in modifying its authorizations to serve different communities 
in the second further notice of proposed rulemaking  the fcc sought comment on technical rules that could potentially expand lpfm licensing opportunities  tentatively concluded that full service stations must provide technical and financial assistance to lpfm stations when implementation of a full service station facility proposal would cause interference to an lpfm station  tentatively concluded that the fcc should adopt a contour based protection methodology to expand lpfm licensing opportunities  stated its intent to address the issues in the 
table of contents fnprm within months  and that the next filing window for a non tabled aural licensed service will be for lpfm only  and recommended to congress that it remove the requirement that lpfm stations protect full power stations operating on third adjacent channels 
if adopted  these rule changes could possibly have an adverse effect on our fm stations  but we cannot predict at this time what specific adverse affect such rule changes might have 
digital audio radio satellite service and internet radio 
the fcc has adopted rules for the digital audio radio satellite service dars in the mhz frequency band 
in adopting the rules  the fcc stated  although healthy satellite dars systems are likely to have some adverse impact on terrestrial radio audience size  revenues and profits  the record does not demonstrate that licensing satellite dars would have such a strong adverse impact that it threatens the provision of local service 
the fcc has granted two nationwide licenses  one to xm satellite radio  which began broadcasting in may  and a second to sirius satellite radio  which began broadcasting in february the satellite radio systems provide multiple channels of audio programming in exchange for the payment of a subscription fee and have filed an application with the fcc seeking its consent to the merger of the two dars service providers 
we cannot predict whether the proposed merger will be approved  or the extent to which  dars will have an adverse impact on our business 
in february  motorola  introduced a new iradio receiver that will permit the reception of audio programming streamed over the internet eg  in automobiles on portable receivers 
we cannot predict whether  or the extent to which  such reception devices will have an adverse impact on our business 
satellite carriage of local tv stations 
the satellite home viewer improvement act shvia  a copyright law  prevents direct to home satellite television carriers from retransmitting broadcast network television signals to consumers unless those consumers are unserved by the over the air signals of their local network affiliate stations  and have not received cable service in the preceding days 
according to the shvia  unserved means that a consumer cannot receive  using a conventional outdoor rooftop antenna  a television signal that is strong enough to provide an adequate television picture 
in december the us court of appeals for the district of columbia upheld the fcc s rules for satellite carriage of local television stations which require satellite carriers to carry upon request all local tv broadcast stations in local markets in which the satellite carriers carry at least one tv broadcast station  also known as the carry one  carry all rule 
in december  congress passed and the president signed the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act of shvera  which again amends the copyright laws and the communications act 
the shvia governs the manner in which satellite carriers offer local broadcast programming to subscribers  but the shvia copyright license for satellite carriers was more limited than the statutory copyright license for cable operators 
specifically  for satellite purposes  local  though out of market ie  significantly viewed signals were treated the same as truly distant eg  hundreds of miles away signals for purposes of the shvia s statutory copyright licenses 
the shvera is intended to address this inconsistency by giving satellite carriers the option to offer commission determined significantly viewed signals to subscribers 
in november   the fcc adopted a report and order to implement shvera to enable satellite carriers to offer fcc determined significantly viewed signals of out of market broadcast stations to subscribers subject to certain constraints set forth in shvera 
the order includes an updated list of stations currently deemed significantly viewed 
in band on channel hybrid digital radio 
on may   the fcc released its second report and order  first order on reconsideration and second further notice of proposed rulemaking digital audio broadcasting systems that adopted rules permitting radio stations to broadcast using in band  on channel iboc as the technology that will allows am and fm stations to operate using the iboc systems developed by ibiquity digital corporation 
this technology has become commonly known as hybrid digital or hd radio 
stations broadcast the same main channel program material in both analog and digital modes 
iboc technology permits hybrid operations  the simultaneous transmission of analog and digital signals with a single am and fm channel 
iboc technology provides near cd quality sound on fm channels and fm quality on am channels 
hybrid iboc operations will have minimal impact on the present broadcast service 
at the present time  we are broadcasting in hd radio on stations and we continue to convert stations to hd radio on an ongoing basis 

table of contents use of fm translators by am stations 
fm translator stations are relatively low power stations that rebroadcast the programs of full power fm stations on a secondary basis  meaning they must terminate or modify their operation if they cause interference to a full power station 
the fcc has proposed to permit am stations to be rebroadcast on fm translator stations in order to improve reception of programs broadcast by am stations 
in the interim  the fcc has granted several requests for special temporary authority to rebroadcast am stations on fm translators 
the company has filed such requests  but none have  so far  been granted 
if the rules are modified to permit regular use of fm translators by am stations  the company intends to use some of its existing fm translators in connection with some of its am stations 
hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of the federal trade commission and the department of justice  the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  may investigate certain acquisitions 
under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds requires the parties to file notification and report forms with the federal trade commission and the department of justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
any decision by the federal trade commission or the department of justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
proposed changes 
the fcc has under consideration  and may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect us and the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties 
application processing rules adopted by the fcc might require us to apply for facilities modifications to our standard broadcast stations in future window periods for filing applications or result in the stations being locked in with their present facilities 
the balanced budget act of authorizes the fcc to use auctions for the allocation of radio broadcast spectrum frequencies for commercial use 
the implementation of this law could require us to bid for the use of certain frequencies 
congress  the courts and the fcc have recently taken actions that may lead to the provision of video services by telephone companies 
the telecommunications act has lifted previous restrictions on a local telephone company providing video programming directly to customers within the telephone company s service areas 
the law now permits a telephone company to distribute video services either under the rules applicable to cable television systems or as operators of so called wireless cable systems as common carriers or under new fcc rules regulating open video systems subject to common carrier regulations 
we cannot predict what effect these services may have on us 
likewise  we cannot predict what other changes might be considered in the future  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  such changes might have on our business

item a 
risk factors the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are described in more detail below 
however  these are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
our business may face additional risks and uncertainties that are unknown to us at this time 
we have substantial indebtedness and debt service requirements at december  our long term debt including the current portion thereof and our guarantee of debt of surtsey productions was approximately  we have borrowed and expect to continue to borrow to finance acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
because of our substantial indebtedness  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is required for debt service 
our leverage could make us vulnerable to an increase in interest rates  a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions 
on march   the revolving commitments as defined in the credit agreement will be permanently reduced quarterly in amounts ranging from to of the total revolving commitments in effect on march  any outstanding balance under the credit agreement will be due on the maturity date of july  in addition  the revolving commitments shall be further reduced by specified percentages of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement based on leverage ratios 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our debt service requirements for interest and 
table of contents scheduled quarterly payments of principal under the credit agreement 
however  if such cash flow is not sufficient  we may be required to sell additional equity securities  refinance our obligations or dispose of one or more of our properties in order to make such scheduled payments 
we cannot be sure that we would be able to effect any such transactions on favorable terms  if at all 
our debt covenants restrict our financial and operational flexibility our credit agreement contains a number of financial covenants which  among other things  require us to maintain specified financial ratios and impose certain limitations on us with respect to investment  additional indebtedness  dividends  distributions  guarantees  liens and encumbrances 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
certain events of default under our credit agreement could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our indebtedness under the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and of our subsidiaries  by a pledge of our subsidiaries stock and by a guarantee of our subsidiaries 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against such available collateral 
we depend on key personnel our business is partially dependent upon the performance of certain key individuals  particularly edward k 
christian  our president and ceo 
although we have entered into employment and non competition agreements with mr 
christian  which terminate on march   and certain other key personnel  including on air personalities  we cannot be sure that such key personnel will remain with us 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on mr 
christian s life 
we can give no assurance that all or any of these employees will remain with us or will retain their audiences 
many of our key employees are at will employees who are under no legal obligation to remain with us 
our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which we may be unwilling to meet 
in addition  any or all of our key employees may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control 
furthermore  the popularity and audience loyalty of our key on air personalities is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes 
a loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could limit our ability to generate revenues 
we depend on key stations historically our top six markets when combined represented  and of our net operating revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
local and national economic conditions may affect our advertising revenue our financial results are dependent primarily on our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the advertising rates a station is able to charge is affected by many factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies 
generally  advertising declines during periods of economic recession or downturns in the economy 
as a result  our revenue is likely to be adversely affected during such periods  whether they occur on a national level or in the geographic markets in which we operate 
during such periods we may also be required to reduce our advertising rates in order to attract available advertisers 
such a decline in advertising rates could also have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations and financial condition 
our stations must compete for advertising revenues in their respective markets both radio and television broadcasting are highly competitive businesses 
our stations compete for listeners viewers and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio and or television stations  as well as with other media  such as broadcast television and or radio as applicable  cable television and or radio  satellite television and or satellite radio systems  newspapers  magazines  direct mail  the internet  coupons and billboard advertising 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and 
table of contents any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could experience a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio or television broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
our success depends on our ability to identify  consummate and integrate acquired stations as part of our strategy  we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional radio and television stations 
broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio and television stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
our consummation of all future acquisitions is subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our future acquisitions may be subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of attractive acquisition opportunities 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or what the consequences will be of any acquisitions 
certain of our acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows 
in addition  the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired stations 
the process of integrating acquired stations may involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risk of entering new markets  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired stations 
our business is subject to extensive federal regulation the broadcasting industry is subject to extensive federal regulation which  among other things  requires approval by the fcc of transfers  assignments and renewals of broadcasting licenses  limits the number of broadcasting properties that may be acquired within a specific market  and regulates programming and operations 
for a detail description of the material regulations applicable to our business  see federal regulation of radio and television broadcasting and other fcc requirements in item of this form k 
failure to comply with these regulations could  under certain circumstances and among other things  result in the denial or revocation of fcc licenses  shortened license renewal terms  monetary fines or other penalties which would adversely affect our profitability 
changes in ownership requirements could limit our ability to own or acquire stations in certain markets 
new technologies may affect our broadcasting operations the fcc has and is considering ways to introduce new technologies to the broadcasting industry  including satellite and terrestrial delivery of digital audio broadcasting and the standardization of available technologies which significantly enhance the sound quality of am broadcasters 
we are unable to predict the effect such technologies may have on our broadcasting operations 
the capital expenditures necessary to implement such technologies could be substantial 
we also face risks in implementing the conversion of our television stations to digital television as required by the fcc 
we have and will continue to incur considerable 
table of contents expense in the conversion to digital television and are unable to predict the extent or timing of consumer demand for any such digital television services 
moreover  the fcc may impose additional public service obligations on television broadcasters in return for their use of the digital television spectrum 
this could add to our operational costs 
one issue yet to be resolved is the extent to which cable systems will be required to carry broadcasters new digital channels 
our television stations are highly dependent on their carriage by cable systems in the areas they serve 
fcc rules that impose no or limited obligations on cable systems to carry the digital television signals of television broadcast stations in their local markets could adversely affect our television operations 
the company is controlled by our president  chief executive officer and chairman as of february   edward k

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item business  item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of saga communications  inc and its subsidiaries contained elsewhere herein 
the following discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
corporate general and administrative expenses  interest expense  other income expense  and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis and are reflected only in our discussion of consolidated results 
our discussion of the results of operations of our operating segments focuses on their operating income because we manage our operating segments primarily based on their operating income 
we evaluate the operating performance of our markets individually 
for purposes of business segment reporting  we have aligned operations with similar characteristics into two business segments radio and television 
the radio segment includes twenty three markets  which includes all ninety one of our radio stations and five radio information networks 
the television segment includes three markets and consists of five television stations and four low power television lptv stations 
general we are a broadcast company primarily engaged in acquiring  developing and operating radio and television stations 
we actively seek and explore opportunities for expansion through the acquisition of additional broadcast properties 
we review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis 
for additional information with respect to acquisitions  see liquidity and capital resources below 
radio segment our radio segment s primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
depending on the format of a particular radio station  there are a predetermined number of advertisements available to be broadcast each hour 
most advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks to a few months 
most of our revenue is generated from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each radio markets sales staff 
for each of the years ended december   and  approximately of our gross radio segment revenue was from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage independent national advertising sales representative firms that specializes in national sales for each of our broadcast markets 
our revenue varies throughout the year 
advertising expenditures  our primary source of revenue  generally have been lowest during the winter months  which include the first quarter of each year 
our net operating revenue  station operating expense and operating income varies from market to market based upon the related market s rank or size which is based upon population and the available radio advertising revenue in that particular market 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the rates a station is able to charge are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers 
in a number of our markets this is measured by periodic reports generated by independent national rating services 
in the remainder of our markets it is measured by the results advertisers obtain through the actual running of an advertising schedule 
advertisers measure these results based on increased demand for their goods or services and or actual revenues generated from such demand 
various factors affect the rate a station can charge  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming  local market competition  target marketing capability of radio compared to other advertising media and signal strength 
because reaching a large and demographically attractive audience is crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
when we acquire and or begin to operate a station or group of stations we generally increase programming 
table of contents and advertising and promotion expenses to increase our share of our target demographic audience 
our strategy sometimes requires levels of spending commensurate with the revenue levels we plan on achieving in two to five years 
during periods of economic downturns  or when the level of advertising spending is flat or down across the industry  this strategy may result in the appearance that our cost of operations are increasing at a faster rate than our growth in revenues  until such time as we achieve our targeted levels of revenue for the acquired station or group of stations 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular radio station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions and ratings 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
any change in our revenue  with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold  is generally the result of inventory sell out ratios and pricing adjustments  which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory 
our radio stations employ a variety of programming formats 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public on any particular format 
we periodically perform market research  including music evaluations  focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies 
our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following 
the primary operating expenses involved in owning and operating radio stations are employee salaries including sales commissions  depreciation  programming expenses  advertising expenses  and promotion expenses 
during the years ended december   and  our columbus  ohio  manchester  new hampshire  milwaukee  wisconsin  and norfolk  virginia markets  when combined  represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated operating income 
an adverse change in any of these radio markets or our relative market position in those markets could have a significant impact on our operating results as a whole 
a decrease in the total available radio advertising dollars in the columbus  ohio and norfolk  virginia markets has resulted in a decline in our revenue and related operating income in our radio stations there 
additionally  we are also experiencing ratings softness in the columbus and norfolk markets which has also affected revenue 
none of our television markets represented more than or more of our consolidated operating income 
the following tables describe the percentage of our consolidated operating income represented by each of these markets percentage of consolidated operating income for the years ended december  market columbus  ohio manchester  new hampshire milwaukee  wisconsin norfolk  virginia we use certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap to assess our financial performance 
for example  we evaluate the performance of our markets based on station operating income operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization 
station operating income is generally recognized by the broadcasting industry as a measure of performance  is used by analysts who 
table of contents report on the performance of the broadcasting industry and it serves as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations 
in addition  we use it to evaluate individual stations  market level performance  overall operations and as a primary measure for incentive based compensation of executives and other members of management 
station operating income is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available to us for debt service requirements  other commitments  reinvestment or other discretionary uses 
station operating income is not a measure of liquidity or of performance in accordance with gaap  and should be viewed as a supplement to  and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on a gaap basis 
during the years ended december   and  the radio stations in our four largest markets when combined  represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated station operating income 
the following tables describe the percentage of our consolidated station operating income represented by each of these markets percentage of consolidated station operating income for the years ended december  market columbus  ohio manchester  new hampshire milwaukee  wisconsin norfolk  virginia operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization television segment our television segment s primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
the number of advertisements available for broadcast on our television stations is limited by network affiliation and syndicated programming agreements and  with respect to children s programs  federal regulation 
our television stations local market managers determine the number of advertisements to be broadcast in locally produced programs only  which are primarily news programming and occasionally local sports or information shows 
our net operating revenue  station operating expense and operating income vary from market to market based upon the market s rank or size  which is based upon population  available television advertising revenue in that particular market  and the popularity of programming being broadcast 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the rates a station is able to charge are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic reports by independent national rating services 
various factors affect the rate a station can charge  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming through locally produced news  sports and weather and as a result of syndication and network affiliation agreements  local market competition  the ability of television broadcasting to reach a mass appeal market compared to other advertising media  and signal strength including cable satellite coverage  and government regulation and policies 
when we acquire and or begin operating a station or group of stations we generally increase programming expenses including local news  sports and weather programming  new syndicated programming  and advertising and promotion expenses to increase our viewership 
our strategy sometimes requires levels of spending commensurate with the revenue levels we plan on achieving in two to five years 
during periods of economic downturns  or when the level of advertising spending is flat or down across the industry  this strategy may result in the appearance that our cost of operations are increasing at a faster rate than our growth in revenues

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures and contingencies 
we evaluate estimates used in preparation of our financial statements on a continual basis  including estimates related to the following revenue recognition revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers is recognized when commercials are broadcast 
revenue is reported net of advertising agency commissions 
agency commissions  when applicable  are based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
all revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 topic  revenue recognition revised and updated 
carrying value of accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are 
table of contents aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history and the length of time the receivables are past due  ranging from for amounts days outstanding to for amounts over days outstanding 
if our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  additional bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances and our average reserves have been approximately of our outstanding receivables 
the effect of an increase in our allowance of of our outstanding receivables as of december   from to or from  to  would result in a decrease in net income of  net of taxes for the year ended december  purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
the excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
broadcast licenses and goodwill we have a significant amount of broadcast licenses and goodwill recorded in our balance sheets  which at december  represents of our total assets 
we determine the recoverability of the cost of our intangible assets based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows of the related market or segment 
under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized and are subject to annual  or more frequent if impairment indicators arise  impairment tests 
we consider fcc broadcast licenses to have indefinite lives 
factors that we considered in evaluating that the radio and television fcc licenses are indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas include the following the radio and television broadcasting licenses may be renewed indefinitely at little cost 
the radio and television broadcasting licenses are essential to our business  and we intend to renew our licenses indefinitely 
we have never been denied the renewal of a fcc broadcast license 
we do not believe that there will be any compelling challenge to the renewal of our broadcast licenses 
we do not believe that the technology used in broadcasting will be replaced by another technology in the foreseeable future 
we test our goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment as of october of each year by comparing their fair value to the related carrying value as of that date 
the results of these tests indicated no impairment as of december  or in  we recorded an impairment charge of the carrying value of goodwill and broadcast licenses of approximately  we used a market approach to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses as well as the fair value of our reporting units 
the market approach used for valuing broadcast licenses and goodwill takes into consideration information available on recent transactions of radio and television stations similar to those owned by us  within the broadcast industry 
to determine the fair value of broadcast licenses and the reporting units goodwill requires the use of estimates in our assumptions 
changes in these estimates could result in additional impairment of intangible assets in the future 

table of contents stock based compensation we adopted the revised sfas no 
 share based payment  sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method and the black scholes valuation model 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at grant date requires assumptions and judgments about expected volatility and forfeiture rates  among other factors 
if actual results differ significantly from these assumptions  then stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that previously recorded 
litigation and contingencies we monitor ongoing litigation and other loss contingencies on a case by case basis as they arise 
losses related to litigation and other contingencies are recognized when the loss is considered probable and the amount is estimable 
market risk and risk management policies our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our long term debt arrangements 
if market interest rates averaged more in than they did during  our interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by   in 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost  short term investment balances  and interest rate swap agreements  if applicable 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on our operations
