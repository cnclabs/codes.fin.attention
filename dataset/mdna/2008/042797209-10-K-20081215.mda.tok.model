table of contents part i item business description of business unless otherwise noted  the term arrowhead refers to arrowhead research corporation  a delaware corporation formerly known as interactive group  inc  the terms the company  we  us  and our  refer to the ongoing business operations of arrowhead and its subsidiaries  whether conducted through arrowhead or a subsidiary of the company arrowhead  the term arc refers to arrowhead research corporation  a privately held california corporation with which arrowhead consummated a stock exchange transaction in january  the term subsidiaries refers collectively to calando pharmaceuticals  inc  unidym  inc  agonn systems  inc 
and tego biosciences corporation and the term common stock refers to arrowhead s common stock and the term stockholder s refers to the holders of common stock or securities exercisable for common stock 
overview arrowhead is a nanotechnology holding company striving to bring new products to market via its subsidiaries and investments in the healthcare  electronics  and clean energy industries 
our mission is to create shareholder value by building subsidiaries that may be monetized in three primary ways subsidiaries may be sold to other companies with proceeds flowing back to arrowhead  subsidiaries may execute an ipo  with proceeds flowing back to arrowhead and or providing arrowhead with tradable stock  and subsidiaries may become mature operating units with earnings consolidated with arrowhead 
in the near term  we are focused on maximizing the value of our most mature subsidiaries  calando pharmaceuticals  inc and unidym  inc  through internal development  partnership and license arrangements  as well as pursuing new sources of cash investments 
our longer term strategy for development and investment in existing subsidiaries and minority investments will be determined by cash availability and the strength of technology and market opportunity 
arrowhead is continually identifying and developing business opportunities for new areas of investment which may be engaged as capital resources allow 
arrowhead has created a scalable platform on which to build highly specialized subsidiaries with an eye to maximizing capital efficiency and accelerating the rate of product development 
our subsidiaries are built around university derived technologies and by acquisition of existing companies 
arrowhead is highly active in the operation of its subsidiaries  providing initial management  operational support  business development and financing 
we believe the combination of these strategies is advantageous and unique for a single institution and that it provides unique advantages to arrowhead s stockholders 
arrowhead s approach is designed to give its subsidiaries and investments an edge in commercializing nanotechnologies by allowing subsidiary management both guidance and the freedom to focus on the development and marketing of their technologies by providing key services to its subsidiaries 
arrowhead currently operates two majority owned subsidiaries  two wholly owned subsidiaries and has minority investments in two early stage nanotechnology companies focused on developing and commercializing nanotech products and applications  including anti cancer drugs  rnai therapeutics  regenerative therapeutics  advanced drug delivery technology  energy storage technology  and carbon based electronics 
the company was originally incorporated in south dakota in  and was reincorporated in delaware in under the name interactive  inc interactive 
on january   interactive consummated a stock exchange transaction with the owners of arc  a privately held california corporation 
this transaction is referred to as the share exchange 
upon consummation of the share exchange  the owners of arc acquired approximately of the common stock of the company 
interactive changed its name to arrowhead research corporation and arc was subsequently dissolved 
the company s principal executive offices are located at south lake avenue  suite  pasadena  california  and its telephone number is as of september   arrowhead research corporation had full time employees at the corporate office and full time employees at its subsidiary companies 

table of contents subsidiaries and investments the company s two majority owned subsidiaries  two wholly owned subsidiaries and two minority investments are focused on developing and commercializing a variety of nanotechnology products and applications  including anti cancer drugs  rnai therapeutics  regenerative therapeutics  advanced drug delivery technology  energy storage technology  carbon based electronics  and fullerene anti oxidants 
arrowhead anticipates expanding its portfolio through selective acquisition and the formation of new companies  as capital resources allow 
as of september   arrowhead held a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the following four subsidiaries and minority interests in two additional companies 
subsidiary ownership technology product focus calando pharmaceuticals  inc acquired june  clinical stage nano engineered delivery of rnai therapeutics and small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer with first anti cancer compound unidym  inc formerly nanopolaris founded april  commercialization of carbon nanotube products for the electronics industry tego biosciences corporation acquired april  license and partnership of technology related to modification of fullerenes for therapeutic and diagnostic applications agonn systems  inc founded may  developing nanotechnology based energy storage devices for hybrid electric vehicles and other large format applications each of calando  unidym and tego has an option plan to help motivate and retain employees 
calando has  outstanding warrants  primarily issued in connection with a financing event that closed in october as of september   assuming all options in each of calando  unidym and tego were awarded and exercised and all warrants were exercised  the company would own approximately of calando  of unidym  and tego 
agonn has not yet adopted an option plan and does not have any outstanding warrants 

table of contents minority investment ownership technology product focus nanotope  inc developing nano engineered  self assembling  bioactive scaffolding for the treatment of spinal cord injury and peripheral artery disease leonardo biosystems  inc developing an advanced set of nanotechnology tools to deliver anti cancer therapeutics in april  arrowhead acquired masa energy llc  a limited liability company whose sole assets were an approximately owner ship position in each nanotope  inc and leonardo biosystems  inc 
arrowhead invested million in nanotope in two tranches of million in july and million in september which brought arrowhead s ownership in nanotope to 
cash resources as a development stage company  arrowhead has historically financed its operations through the sale of securities of arrowhead and its subsidiaries 
development of products at our subsidiaries  in particular calando and unidym  has required significant capital investment since the company s inception in and will continue to require significant cash investment in fiscal for the company to fund operations at historical levels 
at september   arrowhead had cash on hand of approximately million on a consolidated basis 
the company recognizes that if no additional cash resources are obtained  the company must scale back its cash consumption to remain a going concern 
the board has approved a strategy for the company to conserve cash and seek sources of new capital 
to execute this strategy  the board will seek to accomplish one or more of the following on favorable terms out license of technology  sale of a subsidiary  sale of non core assets  funded joint development or partnership arrangements  and sale of securities 
the company is actively involved in discussions with third parties regarding many of these alternatives 
until such time as one or more of these goals is accomplished  the company will continue to implement streamlining and cash conservation measures begun in fiscal and defer major investment in new initiatives 
if no additional cash is obtained by mid second quarter  the company has a plan to make even deeper cuts in its development efforts at calando and unidym and reduce expenses at arrowhead so that the company has cash to fund operations in a limited manner through fiscal and into fiscal see risk factors beginning on page subsidiaries calando pharmaceuticals  inc liquidity in the second quarter of fiscal  the company merged two majority owned subsidiaries  insert therapeutics  inc and calando to bring both drug delivery platforms into the same company 
the merged company is operating under the name calando pharmaceuticals  inc at the same time  calando shifted focus from preclinical and pipeline development to emphasize its clinical program 
consequently  calando s operations were streamlined by reductions in executive and technical staff and the facilities for the two companies were consolidated 
in connection with the reduction in calando s executive management  arrowhead took over the management of calando 
these actions reduced the consumption of cash for salaries and facilities 
however  significant cash was consumed in fiscal in preparation of an it phase ii clinical trial  the calaa phase i clinical trial  and the development of a second rnai therapeutic 
since the merger in april  arrowhead has made a series of cash advances totaling approximately million to fund calando s operations 
subsequent to september   calando has signed agreements to issue million in senior unsecured convertible promissory notes with a two year maturity of which million has been received 
and is seeking to raise an additional million under the same terms 
calando s cash consumption fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on the progress of its projects  but in fiscal  it has ranged between million and million per quarter 
if calando is unsuccessful in attracting additional capital and arrowhead does not have sufficient cash resources to support calando s operations  some or all of calando s development projects would have to be scaled back  interrupted  or abandoned in order to manage cash that calando can operate in a limited manner through fiscal and into fiscal general the company believes that calando is an attractive near term partnership candidate or acquisition target for several pharmaceutical and biotech companies that are active in the development of rnai therapeutics 
systemic delivery has posed a major hurdle to the clinical development of sirna therapeutics 
calando is in ongoing discussions with multiple potential partners and acquirers 
calando is arrowhead s most mature biopharmaceutical subsidiary 
calando s technology and products are based on technology developed at the california institute of technology 
calando utilizes modified cyclodextrin molecules as building blocks to create an entirely new class of drug delivery materials linear cyclodextrin containing polymeric nanoparticles lcdps 
calando s proprietary linear cyclodextrin nanoparticle technology is designed to deliver small molecule drugs using calando s cyclosert tm system and rnai therapeutics using the rondel tm system 
using these platform systems  calando has developed two anti cancer drug candidates that are currently undergoing human clinical trials 
by combining small molecule drugs  nucleic acids ie  microrna or sirna or peptides with our cyclosert polymers  calando believes it can significantly improve the targeting  solubility  stability  toxicity  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of therapeutic compounds 
calando s lcdp nanoparticle platform technologies cyclosert tm and rondel tm actively facilitate the directed transport  efficient uptake and controlled release of therapeutic payloads 
additionally  cell surface receptor ligands can also be attached to our delivery system to provide for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents directly to tumor cells or to other selected tissues 
studies done by calando and others have demonstrated the importance of therapeutic targeting in eliciting a desired therapeutic effect 
calando s first small molecule nanoparticle conjugate drug candidate  it  began clinical trials in july it is a conjugate of cyclosert and the anti cancer agent  camptothecin cpt 
camptothecin is a potent anti cancer agent that was never commercialized mainly due to its devastating side effects  instability in the bloodstream and insolubility 
by combining camptothecin with cyclosert  the solubility  stability  toxicity profile  biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of camptothecin have been significantly improved as shown in calando s phase i clinical trial 
results of in vivo studies in tumor bearing mice demonstrate that calando s cyclosert enhanced camptothecin conjugate it has significantly greater anti tumor activity than its analog anticancer agent  inrinotecan  marketed by pfizer as camptosar 
in phase i clinical studies  it demonstrated safety and multiple patients with extended progression free survival  and was not associated with the severe hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities associated with camptosar 

table of contents calaa is calando s first nanoparticle drug candidate delivering sirna 
calaa is a targeted nanoparticle  comprised of a proprietary  non chemically modified sirna against the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase a clinically validated cancer target formulated with our proprietary rondel rnai oligonucleotide nanoparticle delivery polymer delivery system 
calaa is the first drug delivery system enabled sirna therapeutic to enter clinical trials 
the drug is currently in a dose escalation phase i clinical trial at ucla and the start clinic in san antonio 
the drug delivery and oncology markets despite advances in drug discovery  pharmaceutical firms remain challenged by getting the right compound to the right place in the human body  where it can maximize effect 
additionally  over the next decade  multiple blockbuster pharmaceuticals will go off patent  resulting in a significant loss to the pharmaceutical industry as generics enter the market 
patent expiration coupled with a challenging drug discovery environment  and continued problems with late stage trial failures has left pharmaceutical pipelines thin 
in response  the industry has pursued reformulation of existing or previously failed compounds using new drug delivery technology to expand pipelines and prolong patent life 
the global drug delivery market for all delivery technologies is expected to exceed b by the market for targeted delivery of small molecule pharmaceuticals using particulate liposomal delivery systems is estimated to grow to b in according to the american cancer society  cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states and accounts for approximately one in every four deaths 
the national institutes of health has estimated the direct medical cost of cancer to be in excess of billion per year 
dose limiting toxicity  poor tissue specificity  and large effective distribution are major restrictive factors in effective cancer chemotherapy 
consequently  complete tumor response is not often achieved in patients receiving chemotherapy alone 
this offers a potential for significant opportunity for firms developing technologies to more effectively deliver anti cancer agents to malignant cells 
calando pharmaceuticals platform technologies cyclosert nanoparticles cyclosert links potent therapeutics to linear  cyclodextrin based polymers to generate macromolecular prodrugs 
cyclodextrins are cyclical sugars that are highly water soluble but contain a hydrophobic cavity enabling the formation of complexes with insoluble molecules 
functionalized cyclodextrins are biocompatible and non immunogenic  resist degradation by human enzymes and are non toxic  resulting in their use in many pharmaceutical formulations 
preclinical and clinical studies show that cyclosert retains all of these characteristics of cyclodextrin while providing unprecedented additional functionality 
the components of cyclosert undergo a highly reproducible  proprietary self assembly process resulting in nanoparticles with close to neutral surface charge 
this assembly is mediated by the presence of the drug on the polymer 
data from our preclinical as well as clinical research indicate that cyclosert have been observed to have the following advantages over traditional chemotherapeutics high solubility without the need for additional solubilizing agents increased circulation half life tumor accumulation protection of drugs from enzymatic degradation stealthy to the immune system non toxic polymer carrier www

table of contents stable under physiological conditions significant improvement in therapeutic index compared to the active molecule alone 
this may result in improved quality of life and better efficacy due to on time administration with fewer dose reductions or limitations on the optimal number of therapy cycles 
rondel nanoparticles rna interference  or rnai  is a naturally occurring mechanism within cells that selectively silences and regulates specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
rnai is induced by small  double stranded rna molecules 
one method to activate rnai is with chemically synthesized small interfering rnas  or sirnas  which are double stranded rnas that are targeted to a specific disease associated gene 
the sirna molecules are used by the natural rnai machinery in cells to cause highly targeted gene silencing 
a key roadblock to the therapeutic use of rnai is the lack of an effective delivery mechanism 
sirna is degraded and destroyed in the bloodstream if unprotected and naked sirna is not taken up by cells 
calando addresses the rnai delivery issue with its targeted  cyclodextrin containing polymers that form the foundation for the rondel delivery technology 
the first component is a cyclodextrin containing polycation that  when mixed with sirna  binds to the anionic backbone of the sirna 
the polymer and sirna self assemble into nanoparticles of approximately nm diameter that fully protect the sirna from nuclease degradation in serum 
the cyclodextrin in the polymer enables the surface of the particles to be decorated by stabilizing agents and targeting ligands 
these surface modifications are formed through proprietary linkages 
the surface modifying agents have terminal adamantane groups that form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin and contain polyethylene glycol peg to endow the particles with properties that prevent aggregation  enhance stability and enable systemic administration 
ligands to cell surface receptors can be covalently attached to the adamantane peg modifier  enabling the sirna containing particles to be targeted to tissues of interest 
numerous ligand types eg  small molecules  peptides  proteins can be used 
the rondel system has been designed for use as part of a two vial system one vial contains the foregoing delivery components  and the second vial containing the therapeutic sirna payload 
when mixed pursuant to a simple protocol  the particles self assemble into the nanoparticles as described above 
the rondel delivery system has been designed for intravenous injection 
upon delivery to the target cell  the targeting ligand binds to membrane receptors on the cell surface and the rna containing nanoparticle is taken into the cell by endocytosis 
there  the polymer functions to unpackage the sirna from the delivery vehicle 
clinical development programs it cyclosert enhanced camptothecin calando s lead small molecule drug candidate is it it is comprised of cyclosert conjugated with the anticancer compound cpt for systemic treatment of both primary and metastatic solid tumors 
the primary target of it is topoisomerase i topo i  an enzyme essential to mammalian dna replication 
cpt and its derivatives  such as topotecan and irinotecan  face a number of pharmacologic challenges that it was designed to address i it provides high intratumoral drug concentrations for extended periods of time  keeping the reversible cleavage complex between topo i and cpt from dissociating  ii it minimizes plasma free cpt concentrations thereby reducing the severity of side effects such as diarrhea and severe neutropenia observed with other cpt analogs  and iii it prevents the degradation of cpt to its inactive  open ring carboxylate form 
additionally  recent studies illustrate that low dose and increased frequency of cpt administration results in a down regulation of hypoxia inducible factor hif with a sustained inhibition of tumor growth independent of dna breaks 
the it development program is specifically designed to take full advantage of these mechanisms of action by providing linear delivery of cpt for prolonged periods with a low plasma free cpt concentration  thus avoiding the toxicity observed with traditional non polymerized topoisomerase inhibitors 
calando completed clinical trials with it at the city of hope cancer center coh in duarte  california in october the trial was an open label  dose escalation phase i study in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors refractory to other therapies 
initially  the trial utilized a weekly dosing schedule 
a subsequent phase ib 
table of contents study was conducted utilizing a twice monthly dosing schedule 
all trial endpoints have been successfully achieved 
the drug was found to be well tolerated in both the phase ia and ib studies of the trial 
a high proportion of patients displayed stable disease following treatment thereby showing evidence of it s cytostatic activity 
this activity is consistent with several published clinical studies reporting improved outcomes when lower doses of topotecan were administered on a continuous regimen compared to traditional intermittent schedules 
topotecan is an fda approved a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic that is an analog of cpt 
calaa sirna for rrm knockdown calando s lead sirna product candidate  calaa  is a formulation containing calando s proprietary delivery technology with an sirna duplex payload targeting the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  a well established cancer target 
ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleosides to deoxyribonucleosides and is necessary for dna synthesis and replication 
the duplex  developed at calando  demonstrates potent anti proliferative activity across multiple types of cancer cells 
calando believes that calaa is the first systemically delivered sirna therapeutic to enter the oncology clinic 
calando believes that calaa is also the first clinical stage sirna therapeutic utilizing a targeted nanoparticle delivery system 
calando and its collaborators have generated preclinical data that demonstrate sequence specific inhibition of tumors from the systemic administration of targeted formulations of sirna 
using the rondel delivery system and sirna developed at calando targeting the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase rrm  in collaboration with colleagues at the livingston research institute  reduced tumor growth rates and or tumor reduction have been observed in a variety of animal cancer models 
in may  calando initiated an open label  dose escalation phase i study in patients with solid tumors refractory to other therapies 
this study is ongoing at ucla jonsson cancer center in los angeles  ca and at south texas accelerated research therapeutics start in san antonio  texas 
product pre clinical development programs calaa rondel sirna calando s next anti cancer sirna therapeutic is currently in preclinical development 
the intracellular target for calaa is hif alpha  or hypoxia inducible factor alpha 
hif alpha is over expressed in a number of solid tumors and is critical for many aspects of tumorigenesis  such as metastasis  angiogenesis  tumor cell proliferation  and tumor response to radiation 
hif alpha has been difficult to target using traditional drugs but has been shown to be effectively targeted by the proprietary sirna in calaa intellectual property calando controls an intellectual property portfolio 
patents covering linear cyclodextrin polymers for delivery of small molecule  nucleic acid and peptide drug candidates are exclusively licensed from caltech 
these patents are directed at both rondel and cyclosert and contain composition of matter  method of use and manufacturing process claims 
calando also owns a patent on the sirna active ingredient in calaa and has filed a patent application to cover the sirna active ingredient of calaa the camptothecin component of it is off patent 
calando has licensed patents from alnylam relevant to sirna therapeutics for calaa and calaa calando has in licensed from r d pharmaceuticals exclusive rights to second generation synthetic epothilones 
however  the rnai and nanoparticle drug delivery patent landscape is complex and rapidly evolving 
as such  calando may need to obtain additional patent licenses prior commercialization of its lead drug candidates 

table of contents outsourced manufacturing and product supply calando currently uses  and expects to continue to be dependent upon  contract manufacturers to manufacture each of its product candidates 
calando has established a quality control and quality assurance program  including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications  designed to ensure that its products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing procedures  or cgmps  and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations 
additional manufacturing resources would require additional investment  and calando may seek to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other parties that have established manufacturing capabilities 
it is likely that calando will continue to rely on third party manufacture of its development and commercial products on a contract basis 
currently  calando has agreements with third party vendors to furnish calaa and it drug supply for clinical studies 
calando will be dependent upon these third parties to supply products in a timely manner manufactured in compliance with cgmps or similar standards imposed by foreign regulatory authorities where its products are tested and or marketed 
competition calando is engaged in the rapidly changing business of developing treatments for human disease through the regulation of gene expression and delivery of generic and proprietary novel cancer therapies 
competition in these fields is intense as other companies are developing therapies similar to our nanoparticle drug delivery systems  and targeting patient populations that are similar to the patient populations that are targeted by calando 
a number of companies are pursuing research and development programs relating to the emerging area of cancer therapies using nanoparticle conjugates and rna interference 
a number of these companies have filed patent applications in the area of nanoparticle conjugates and rna interference 
it is difficult to predict whether any of these companies will be successful in obtaining patent protection  whether the patent protection sought will address important aspects of the technology and to what extent these companies will be successful in their rna interference efforts 
new competitors may arise and we may not be aware of all competitors in this space 
a number of calando s competitors are more established and have greater resources than calando does 
furthermore  even if calando is successful in developing commercial products  it is possible that competitors will achieve greater market acceptance 
in addition to irinotecan pfizer daiichi and topotecan gsk  which are small molecule analogs of camptothecin  other companies are developing topoisomerase i formulations with a goal of delivering a more effective and tolerable therapy than the approved camptothecin based products 
companies engaged in nanoparticle chemotherapeutic drug formulations at various stages of development include  nippon kayaku  sonus pharmaceuticals  celator pharmaceuticals  samyang  cell therapeutics  pharmaengine  enzon  nektar therapeutics  tempo pharmaceuticals  bind biosciences  hermes  neopharm and alza 
this list of potential competitors may not be a complete list of competing firms developing nanoparticle based oncology products 
systemic delivery of sirna and other oligonucleotide therapeutics has proven critical for the success of all nucleic acid therapeutics 
naturally  multiple firms have recognized the problem of systemic sirna delivery as a significant opportunity and other firms are developing products in this space 
companies developing sirna delivery products include but are not limited to alnylam  merck  roche  tekmira  rxi pharmaceuticals  pharmrx and intradigm

table of contents unidym  inc liquidity unidym raised a total of million of equity financing in fiscal in fiscal  unidym consumed large amounts of cash to scale up the manufacture of carbon nanotubes  scale up for the production and sale of carbon nanotube based film product  acquire another nanotech company  expand its business development activities  and prepare for an initial public offering 
in the first and second quarters of fiscal  unidym expanded its executive  technical and administrative staff for these activities 
unidym s cash burn increased from million in the second quarter  to million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter  it became clear that unidym would be unable to meet its fund raising goals to support its cash needs 
moreover  technical development took longer than expected 
additionally  it became evident that dramatic changes in the financial markets would not allow for an initial public offering 
starting in october  several general and administrative positions were eliminated 
approximately half of unidym s employees at the houston  tx facility were put on unpaid leave to conserve cash 
further cuts to personnel and consolidation of facilities are planned to bring unidym s cash needs to of those in fourth quarter despite these changes  unidym will still need to obtain additional cash to fund its operations and obligations through fiscal subsequent to september   unidym obtained financing from a strategic investor 
the terms of the investment include a put option whereby certain material intellectual property assets could be foreclosed on unless unidym meets certain obligations by mid moreover  pursuant to a license between unidym and rice university  should unidym become insolvent  other material intellectual property assets would revert to rice 
see intellectual property below 
general unidym is the company s most mature nanomaterials company and provides an example of a company building strategy that arrowhead plans to replicate in other areas of nanotechnology 
through the acquisition of a foundational intellectual property portfolio in the manufacture and applications of carbon nanotubes cnts  unidym has developed a strong technology base in cnt technology that we believe can serve as a platform for innovation and new products 
carbon nanotubes are a novel material with extraordinary electrical  thermal  and mechanical properties 
unidym has already developed world leading high performance carbon nanotube materials manufactured by scalable processes 
unidym s product development efforts are focused on the electronics industry  where there is continuing demand for higher performance materials 
unidym is initially targeting sales of its film product to the touch panel market 
unidym has recently entered into selective intellectual property licensing arrangements to license its cnt technologies to customers or partners in markets outside unidym s primary focus of electronics 
unidym s product development has been focused on thin  transparent films of carbon nanotubes on a flexible substrate 
the cnt based film is designed to replace the expensive  failure prone materials currently employed by manufacturers of such devices as touch screens  flat panel displays  solar cells and solid state lighting 
cnt based film offers substantial advantages over ito and izo  the currently used materials  including lower cost  improved durability  enhanced flexibility  higher yields  better readability in display applications  and simplified processing 
unidym is currently sampling its film products to the world s leading touch panel companies 
unidym is also working with leading lcd companies  including a joint development agreement with samsung electronics  to incorporate cnt films into their display devices 
through its various collaborations  unidym has also fabricated prototype lcd and electrophoretic displays incorporating cnt based films 
for its initial product offering to touch panel makers  unidym is currently evaluating the most favorable business model to pursue 
in one model  unidym would synthesize cnts  formulate those cnts into a coating ink  and outsource production of the films to a toll coater to produce the film 
unidym would pay for production of the films on a time and materials basis  and unidym would directly market and sell the films to touch panel makers 
under a second model that is less capital intensive  unidym would synthesize cnts and cnt inks  and then ship the inks to company that would manufacture and sell films to touch panel makers 
acquisitions in  arrowhead saw an opportunity in carbon nanotubes and started the company that would become unidym to address it 
we believed that cnts had the potential to significantly impact multiple large and diverse industries 
at the time unidym was launched  the cnt market was highly fragmented with key patents dispersed across multiple owners and there was no clear industry leader 
unidym has since licensed technology from a dozen universities and acquired three prominent cnt companies  including carbon nanotechnologies  inc  the pioneering company in high performance cnts  and has become a leader in the development of innovative cnt enabled products for the electronics industry 
in the process  unidym has assembled a strong and diverse patent portfolio that we believe covers high performance cnt manufacturing and processing  as well as multiple product applications 
unidym was formed when nanopolaris  a subsidiary of arrowhead research corporation  acquired the assets of an early stage company called unidym  inc at the time of the acquisition  nanopolaris had already consolidated certain intellectual property related to carbon nanomaterials 
nanopolaris purchased the assets of the former unidym to gain access to the company s substantial expertise and intellectual property in carbon nanotube films 
after its purchase of unidym s assets in june  nanopolaris changed its name to unidym 

table of contents in april  unidym merged with carbon nanotechnologies  inc cni of houston  texas  a company founded in by the late dr 
richard smalley of rice university 
dr 
smalley and his collaborators won the nobel prize in chemistry for their discovery of carbon fullerenes  an allotrope or molecular form of carbon closely related to the carbon nanotube 
dr 
smalley s pioneering work led to the development of a suite of more than patents including issued us patents owned by cni or exclusively licensed to cni by rice university  as well as the development of significant development and production infrastructure for the production of cnt materials 
since its inception  cni provided bulk cnt materials to customers and has won research grants from government agencies such as the national institute of science nist and the state of missouri 
in july  unidym acquired nanoconduction  inc  a sunnyvale  ca company developing nano based electronic cooling technology nanoconduction 
the merger provides unidym with access to nanoconduction s patent portfolio  which will supplement unidym s existing patent portfolio and provides unidym with additional opportunities to out license and leverage its technology 
in addition  through the merger  unidym will gain access to research facilities and equipment that will be used in unidym s ongoing research and development activities 
unidym accomplished the acquisition of nanoconduction through an equity exchange  as follows 
arrowhead invested  in unidym through a cashless investment by issuing  shares of unregistered common stock to the owners of nanocondution 
in exchange for this investment  the company received  additional shares of series c preferred stock of unidym 
as additional consideration  unidym agreed to assume and discharge nanoconduction s assets and liabilities 
assets included equipment and leasehold improvements with an estimated net book value of approximately million including intellectual property related to the use of carbon nanotubes for thermal management 
liabilities included approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and approximately million in capital equipment loans 
the equipment loans are guaranteed by unidym and secured by a lien on nanoconduction assets 
unidym entered into a new five year lease for the facilities currently occupied by nanoconduction in sunnyvale  california  with the intention of moving unidym s existing menlo park operations to the nanoconduction facility 
competition unidym faces competition from a number of start ups and established companies in the industries it enters 
in the electronics industry  there are a number of start up or private companies that are focused on the application or production of nanotubes including atomate  c nano  eikos  nantero and southwest nanotechnologies 
more established companies with announced cnt programs include brewer sciences  dupont  honeywell  samsung  sumitomo and toray 
there are also potential competitors who are pursuing alternative nanotech based approaches to the markets served by unidym  including the start up cambrios and large japanese companies such as fujitsu 
production production carbon nanotube based transparent conductive films unidym s film production model involves in house synthesis of a proprietary grade of cnts  formulation of those cnts into a coating ink  and then shipment of that ink to an outsourced coating partner or customer for deposition 
to conserve cash and pursue a strategy designed to yield revenues in the short term  unidym is exploring partnerships or outsourcing arrangements for volume manufacture and distributions of its films 
unidym has in house deposition or coating equipment which is used for the deposition of cnts onto plastic or glass substrates in sample quantities 
unidym has also tested production samples from several coating subcontractors 
the use of outsourced coating partners for its touch panel films would take advantage of the substantial excess capacity left in the coating industry by the decrease in demand for photographic film 
unidym expects that given the abundance of these subcontractors and the availability of cost effective subcontract capacity  there will be no need to bring production capacity in house for the near or intermediate term 
however  longer term  unidym could decide to bring such production in house if it is advantageous to the company to do so 

table of contents carbon nanotube production and purification unidym has developed two different processes for commercial production high pressure carbon monoxide hipco or mgp and modified gas phase mgp  as well as a new process  modified gas phase mgp which is in the final stages of development and qualification 
by varying production conditions and post processing techniques  unidym is able to produce a wide variety of nanotube grades that are tailored to different markets 
unidym is focusing its cnt production capabilities on producing electronic grade cnts for transparent conductive film rather than volume manufacture of several grades of bulk materials 
unidym is currently exploring more cost efficient alternatives to operating its houston facility 
in addition to significant cuts to personnel in houston  unidym is exploring the move of its production capabilities to its facility in sunnyvale or outsourcing the production of its cnt products to a third party 
it is expected that significant cuts in personnel in houston will be implemented in the near future 
collaborations and partnerships unidym has several ongoing joint development agreements with various partners to incorporate its transparent conductive films into touch panels and displays 
in  several prototypes were demonstrated at industry conferences 
unidym and samsung electronics co  ltd 
extended their collaboration to integrate carbon nanotube materials as the transparent conductive layer in display devices 
the world s first carbon nanotube based color active matrix electrophoretic display epd e paper was demonstrated at the society for information display in may and at the international meeting on information display imid at kintex  ilsan  korea in october the new color e paper device is a format display that uses a carbon nanotube cnt transparent electrode developed by unidym 
the display was one product of the ongoing joint development agreement between unidym and samsung 
in addition  unidym displayed a carbon nanotube based active matrix lcd made in collaboration with silicon display technology  a company based in seoul  korea 
in march  unidym sub licensed certain of its intellectual property to ensysce biosciences inc ensysce whose focus is research into the medical therapeutic applications of carbon nanotubes 
from march to november  ensysce was both funded and effectively controlled by a related party to unidym who also serves as a director of unidym 
in november  unidym sold its percent interest in ensysce to the controlling shareholder for  and will recognize a gain on the sale during the first quarter of fiscal unidym entered into a strategic alliance with the battelle memorial institute in july to explore opportunities to leverage their respective capabilities to commercialize products incorporating carbon nanotubes 
battelle is the world s largest non profit independent research and development organization  with  employees in more than locations worldwide 
in  unidym expanded this relationship to include an alliance focused on multi functional nanocomposites for aerospace and transportation applications 
other collaborative projects include the use of unidym s carbon nanotubes to increase strength and flexibility  while reducing stress failures due to flight loads  in the engine cowling of an aerobatic airplane and the use of unidym s transparent conductive film in solar cells 
marketing and sales unidym expected to generate a small amount of revenue from sales of thin films in fourth quarter of fiscal that expectation was not met and unidym has revised its projections 
revenue is expected to be generated through direct product sales and license deals into relatively consolidated industries 
in the near term  unidym does not expect to generate enough revenue to self fund its operations and growth 
unidym currently has a distribution relationship with the large japanese trading firm  sumitomo  for the distribution of its cnt materials in asia 
unidym expects to use similar distributors to assist in the distribution of its cnt based transparent conductive films 
intellectual property unidym controls an intellectual property portfolio containing more than foreign and domestic patents and patent applications  including more than issued patents 
the portfolio contains patent claims directed to fundamental carbon nanotube compositions of matter  as well as carbon nanotube synthesis  purification  dispersion and functionalization 
furthermore  the portfolio contains claims to the use of carbon nanotubes in many different application areas including fibers  electronics  composite materials  energy storage generation  medical devices and drug delivery 
some patents are owned by unidym but most are exclusively licensed from institutions such as rice university  ibm  georgia tech  clemson  university of florida  suny  penn state  ucla  duke  rensselaer polytechnic institute  and caltech 
additionally  unidym acquired the right to sublicense us patent  which is the basic patent claiming single walled nanotube compositions of matter 
unidym also exclusively licenses tego s entire intellectual property including siemens ag s us patent  and its international counterparts  for non therapeutic fields of use 
unidym has exclusively licensed its portfolio to ensysce biosciences inc  in the field of the therapeutics 
unidym is currently executing a plan to encourage third parties and competitors to enter non exclusive licenses of its intellectual property outside of its core areas 
to facilitate this plan  unidym is also making options available to acquire non exclusive licenses at a later date 
a material portion of unidym s intellectual property portfolio is exclusively licensed from rice university 
if the sum of unidym s debts  liabilities and other obligations is greater than all of unidym s assets at fair valuation or if unidym is generally not paying its debts  liabilities and other obligations as they come due  the rice license will terminate 
see risk factors if unidym is unable to raise additional cash  unidym may lose rights to critical intellectual property 
on november   unidym raised million from the sale of series c preferred stock to tel ventures tel 
the sale of these securities was associated with unidym s entry into a security agreement granting tel a security interest in unidym s physical and intellectual property the collateral  which  however  excludes unidym s rights under the rice license and shares of ensysce biosciences  inc 
the subscription agreement provided tel with two put options 
tel may exercise the first put option if unidym fails to enter into a joint development agreement with tel by june  in that case  unidym must buy back tel s unidym shares for million before march tel may exercise the second option if unidym fails to meet certain cash requirements by june  those requirements would be met if unidym raises million through any combination of a sale of its equity  the sale or license of some or all of its assets and businesses including positions in ensysce biosciences  nexeon medsystems or nanocondution  or sales of products 
only if tel exercises this put option between june and july   shall unidym be obligated to repurchase the series c preferred stock for million within ten days notification of exercise 
in the event of a default under the security agreement  eg  inability to pay either of the put options  bankruptcy  admission of inability to pay its bills  tel can take possession of the collateral and keep net proceeds of any sale thereof

agonn systems  inc general arrowhead founded agonn in may to explore  develop and commercialize nanotechnology based energy storage devices for electric vehicles and other large format applications 
agonn is pursuing a strategy to acquire energy storage technologies based on nanoscale engineering from research institutions 
agonn has outsourced the development of prototype ultracapacitors based on carbon nanomaterials and other advanced materials 
we believe the markets for energy storage products are substantial  ranging from consumer electronics to vehicles to heavy industry 
we believe that emerging clean technology platforms offer market opportunities for new energy storage devices  in part because traditional batteries lack sufficient performance for widespread adoption 
ultracapacitors are energy storage devices that generally have high power but low energy storage capabilities 
in other words  they can provide large bursts of power  but only for short periods of time 
however  unlike batteries which generally take minutes or hours to charge  ultracapacitors can be charged in seconds or less 
moreover  while the lifetimes of the best lithium ion batteries are generally limited to several thousand charging cycles  ultracapacitors can last for hundreds of thousands of cycles 
given these characteristics  ultracapacitors often serve as complements to  as opposed to replacements  for batteries 
if the energy storage capability of ultracapacitors could be sufficiently increased  however  ultracapacitors could represent a viable alternative to batteries in certain applications 
this could result in ultracapacitor based energy storage devices that are rapidly chargeable  capable of delivering large amounts of power over long periods of time  while also being lighter and more long lived than currently available batteries 
research and development agonn is currently pursuing a capital efficient r d model based on outsourced prototyping and testing 
agonn is prototyping and testing different electrode architectures based on carbon nanomaterials including random networks of carbon nanotubes  vertically aligned carbon nanotubes  and graphene as well as metal nitride nanoparticles 
additionally  agonn is evaluating novel electrolytes that have been shown to operate at higher voltages than existing electrolytes and within greater temperature ranges 
agonn is also evaluating new cell designs based on asymmetric electrode configurations 
concurrent with its technology evaluation program  agonn is seeking to determine the most cost effective path for large volume manufacturing of ultracapacitor products based on these new materials 
these activities are preparatory in nature and require little capital and other resources 
if agonn is able to aggregate a suite of intellectual property relating to the field of ultracapacitor technology  based on cash resources  technology development and market opportunity  arrowhead may more aggressively pursue the development of agonn

tego biosciences corporation general tego was formed to acquire the assets of c sixty  inc in april since  c sixty had been developing fullerene based products 
c sixty s primary asset was an intellectual property portfolio which includes key patents for the modification of fullerenes 
fullerenes are a family of symmetrical carbon cage molecules whose prototypical soccer ball shaped member is comprised of sixty carbon atoms denoted c 
in order to exploit the therapeutic potential of fullerenes  they must first be chemically modified to render them water soluble 
a patented process known as the bingel reaction is of particular significance to fullerene chemistry because it enables modification of the fullerene sphere to provide solubility and appropriate physiologic behavior 
tego has an exclusive license to patents directed at the bingel reaction itself  as well as a large number of modified soluble fullerenes created through its use 
tego also owns or has exclusive licenses to patents directed to a variety of medical uses of bingel modified fullerenes 
tego does not initially intend to manufacture and market its products directly 
rather  it is pursuing a strategy of partnering  licensing  and outsourced manufacturing 
collaborations  research and development tego does not intend to hire staff to develop fullerene products 
however  tego is currently evaluating certain proprietary fullerenes for their suitability as potential therapeutics in macular degeneration utilizing a contract research organization 
the national cancer institute  working in concert with the national institute of standards and technology nist and the us food and drug administration fda  established the nanotechnology characterization laboratory ncl 
cancer 
gov to perform preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing of nanoparticles 
in august  the ncl issued a report containing the evaluation of several tego owned fullerenes entitled  functionalized fullerenes for c sixty  inc which is available on the ncl s website at the following link http ncl 
cancer 
gov ncla pdf tego and the huntington medical research institute hmri have completed a project investigating the hyperpolarization potential of the c labeled fullerene derivatives developed by tego 
the study found that a proprietary carbon labeled fullerene provided a sufficiently strong signal to potentially enable powerful real time magnetic resonance imaging of biological and physiological functions in patients 
to conserve cash  tego is pursuing a model that seeks to earn revenue from licenses and collaborative partnerships 
to the extent cash resources permit  tego will focus any future development efforts on contrast agents and therapeutics for back of the eye disease 
competition tego is competing with other companies developing fullerene products as well as alternatives to fullerene products 
there are several companies that manufacture and sell fullerenes and fullerene formulations  including frontier carbon corporation mitsubishi subsidiary and nano c 
there are also companies developing fullerene based therapeutics  including luna nanoworks and vitamin c bioresearch mitsubishi subsidiary 

table of contents intellectual property tego controls a domestic and international patent portfolio 
it owns and controls patents covering a library of functionalized fullerenes as well as methods of their synthesis 
the fullerenes on which tego has concentrated its efforts are c and df tego is the exclusive licensee of siemens ag s us patent  and its international counterparts for therapeutics and diagnostics 
the bingel patent covers a vast library of fullerenes functionalized according to the bingel method  eg  c  as well as methods of making them 
tego also exclusively licenses siemens us patent no 
 and its international counterparts for therapeutics and diagnostics 
this patent covers dendrimeric fullerenes such as df tego licenses patents from washington university which are directed at methods of using tego s fullerenes  eg  c  to enhance neuronal survival in a variety of contexts

minority investments nanotope  inc general nanotope is a company in the field of regenerative medicine developing a suite of products customized to regenerate specific tissues  including neuronal  vascular  bone  myocardial  and cartilage 
its two lead candidates are focused on spinal cord regeneration and treatment of peripheral artery disease pad 
pad causes the loss of vasculature in the extremedities and it has been estimated that as many as of people over the age of has some form of pad 
currently there is no treatment for regenerating lost vasculature 
nanotope has demonstrated in multiple animal models that injection of its angiogenic compound leads to revascularization of affected areas 
importantly  neither the spinal cord or pad treatments use stem cells 
nanotope s products work with surviving cells and tissues to spur regeneration

table of contents aonex technologies  inc in may  arrowhead sold its majority owned subsidiary aonex technologies  inc to new hampshire based amberwave systems  inc 
for an upfront fee of  and earn out payments of up to million plus a royalty on solar products or licenses covering years from the date of the merger 
amberwave took over aonex s pasadena  california operations and is continuing to develop aonex s technology 
the losses incurred by aonex are segregated in the consolidated statement of operations as loss from operation of discontinued aonex 
academic partnerships since inception  arrowhead has worked with some of the most outstanding academic institutions in the country  including the california institute of technology caltech  stanford university  duke university and the university of florida  in critical areas such as stem cell research  carbon electronics and molecular diagnostics 
this has provided the company with deep network in the academic community  insight into cutting edge technologies and a world class scientific advisory board 
through these partnerships  arrowhead has gained access to exclusive rights that have formed the basis for the company s subsidiaries and minority investments and have leveraged university resources to further develop and test technology in a highly cost effective way 
the collaborations with academic scientists have included technology licenses and options to license technology  sponsored research  donations to the labs of individual scientists and use of university facilities that are made available to development stage companies 
in prior years  arrowhead devoted significant capital resources to sponsored research 
as the subsidiaries have matured  the company has decreased its reliance on sponsored research for technology development and sponsored research expense has decreased 
as of september   arrowhead had one active sponsored research agreement at duke university through unidym 
depending on capital resources  arrowhead is likely to continue to invest in nanoscience research and development through sponsored research agreements at universities 

table of contents item a 
risk factors we are a development stage company and we have limited historical operations 
we urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development 
the following is a summary of certain risks we face 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our financial condition we do not have sufficient cash reserves to fund our activities at their current pace for the next fiscal year 
our plan of operations is to provide substantial amounts of research project funding and financial support for majority owned subsidiaries over an extended period of time 
our board of directors has adopted a cash conservation strategy that scales back arrowhead s financial support for unidym and calando at this time 
this has influenced unidym s shift from capital intensive bulk cnt manufacturing to thin film license and partnerships for electronic ink products 
development of new drug candidates at calando has slowed during this time as well 
we will need to obtain additional capital in the near term to support all of these projects  and we may plan to do so by out licensing technology  selling one or more of our subsidiaries  securing funded partnerships  conducting one or more private placements of equity securities of arrowhead or its subsidiaries  selling additional securities in a registered public offering  or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these endeavors or  if we are successful that such transactions will be accomplished on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will be required to engage in additional cash savings by limiting further activities at one or more of our subsidiaries  or at arrowhead  which could materially harm our business and our ability to achieve cash flow in the future  including possibly delaying or reducing implementation of certain aspects of our plan of operations or deferring or abandoning research programs 
even if we are successful in raising capital for one area of our business  because arrowhead and each subsidiary are separate entities  it could be difficult or impossible to allocate funds as we would like 
the current financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
neither arrowhead nor its subsidiaries generate substantial revenue  and  to date  our operations  research and development activities have been funded through the sale of arrowhead securities and securities of our subsidiaries 
current market conditions could impair our ability to raise the capital we need and if we are unable to secure additional cash resources from the sale of securities or other sources  it could become necessary to slow  interrupt or close down development efforts at calando or unidym 
in addition  we may have to cut expenses at the arrowhead level which could impair our ability to manage our business and our subsidiaries 
even if investment capital is available to us  in the current market  the terms may be onerous and could significantly dilute our ownership interest in either calando or unidym 
the sale of additional arrowhead stock to fund operations could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
the strategy for eventual monetization of our subsidiaries could depend on our ability to exit our ownership position each subsidiary 
exit opportunities could include an initial public offering for the subsidiary or acquisition of the subsidiary by another company 
due to the current financial crisis  companies are adopting conservative acquisition strategies and  even if there is interest  may not be able to acquire our subsidiaries on attractive terms or at all 
this could reduce the return we realize on our investment if we sell a subsidiary 
additionally  the market for initial public offerings is severely limited  which limits public exit opportunities for our subsidiaries 

table of contents our subsidiaries have entered into technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective  and if these agreements are terminated  our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected 
through our subsidiaries  we have entered into exclusive  long term license agreements with rice university  california institute of technology caltech  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc and other entities to incorporate their proprietary technologies into our proposed products 
these license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions  including conditions related to the commercialization of the licensed technology 
we cannot give any assurance that we will successfully incorporate these technologies into marketable products or  if we do  whether sales will be sufficient to recover the amounts that we are obligated to pay to the licensors 
failure by us to satisfy our obligations under these agreements may result in the modification of the terms of the licenses  such as by rendering them non exclusive  or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us  which would limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition 
if unidym is unable to raise additional cash  unidym may lose rights to critical intellectual property 
there is also the possibility that unidym investor tel ventures will have the right to exercise a put right in july  forcing unidym to redeem tel venture s series c preferred stock for million 
unidym s potential repurchase obligation is secured by a first priority lien in unidym s physical and intellectual property excluding rights under the rice license 
in the event unidym is unable to pay tel ventures upon exercise of the put right  tel ventures will acquire all right  title and interest in the collateral intellectual property and unidym s patent protection for its products and its ability to pursue a licensing strategy would be impaired significantly 
further  unidym is required to meet certain financial covenants pursuant to the rice university license agreement it acquired upon its acquisition of cni 
when unidym acquired cni  cni possessed intellectual property rights concerning carbon nanotubes that it had licensed from rice university 
the rice license includes financial covenants tested quarterly for compliance 
if unidym fails to meet the financial covenants  the rice license automatically terminates 
if this should happen  the value of unidym s intellectual property portfolio would be significantly and adversely affected and unidym would likely lose patent protection for its products and licensing opportunities for the majority of its cnt intellectual portfolio 
we have debt on our balance sheet  which could have consequences if we were unable to repay the principal or interest due 
calando 
calando has million in unsecured convertible promissory notes outstanding of which m has been received 
the notes bear interest accrued annually and have a two year maturity 
following maturity  the notes become payable on demand 
if calando is unable to meet its obligations to the bearers of the notes after maturity  arrowhead may also not be in a position to lend calando sufficient cash to pay such demand notes individually or all at once 
unless other sources of financing become available  this could result in calando s insolvency and calando would be unable to continue operations 
unidym 
we have debt on our consolidated balance sheet  including a capital lease obligation acquired in connection with unidym s acquisition of nanoconduction  inc the capital lease obligation requires us to pay million in monthly payments for capital equipment at unidym s sunnyvale  california location and the equipment itself serves as collateral for the debt 
unidym s ability to make payments on its indebtedness will depend on its ability to conserve the cash that it has on hand and to generate cash in the future 
neither unidym nor arrowhead currently generates significant revenue 
because unidym does currently have a substantial amount of cash on hand  unidym might be required divert cash from development activities or to generate cash via debt or equity financing to be able to meet the monthly payment requirements under the capital lease obligation 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
also  given the current economic credit crisis  financing options might be limited going forward  which could prevent unidym from obtaining the necessary funds to pay its indebtedness when due 
because the equipment serves as collateral for the debt  if unidym is unable to make the monthly payments when due  the lessor of the equipment  at its discretion  may seize the equipment and unidym would not be able to use the equipment in its development activities 
the costs to fund the operations of our subsidiaries are difficult to predict  and our anticipated expenditures in support of our subsidiaries may increase for a variety of reasons 
it is possible that the completion of our clinical studies could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including difficulties in enrolling patients  delays in manufacturing  incomplete or inconsistent data from the pre clinical or clinical trials  and difficulties evaluating the trial results 
any delay in completion of a trial would increase the cost of that trial  which would harm the company s results of operations 
due to these uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the size  nature or timing of the costs to complete or the amount or timing of the net cash inflows from the current activities of any of our biopharmaceutical subsidiaries or investments 
until the company obtains further relevant pre clinical and clinical data  it will not be able to estimate its future expenses related to these programs or when  if ever  and to what extent  the company will receive cash inflows from resulting products 

table of contents development  manufacturing and sale of cost effective electronic products incorporating carbon nanotubes may require significant additional investment and take a long time 
it is possible that the development and scale up of unidym s carbon nanotube manufacturing effort and its development and scale up of its transparent conductive film products could be delayed for a number of reasons  including unforeseen difficulties with the technology development and delays in adoption of the technology by customers 
any delay would result in additional unforeseen costs  which would harm the company s results of operations 
due to these uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the size  nature or timing of the costs to complete the development of unidym s products or net cash inflows from unidym s current activities 

table of contents risks related to our business model and company we are a development stage company and our success is subject to the substantial risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
the implementation of our business strategy is still in the development stage 
we currently own majority interests in four subsidiary companies  investments in two early stage biotech companies and  through unidym  one university research project at duke university 
our business and operations should be considered to be in the development stage and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business venture 
accordingly  our intended business and operations may not prove to be successful in the near future  if at all 
any future success that we might enjoy will depend upon many factors  several of which may be beyond our control  or which cannot be predicted at this time  and which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  business prospects and operations and the value of an investment in our company 
the costs and effect of consolidating unidym s facilities and operations are difficult to predict and could be substantial 
unidym is in the process of consolidating its facilities and operations 
unidym has leased a new facility in texas that it has decided not to occupy and we cannot predict how long it will take to sublease the property  if it can be subleased at all 
the lease on a portion of unidym s current facility has been terminated and the facility must be completely vacated in the near future 
as part of it lease on its houston facility  unidym is obligated to make certain repairs and clean up the facility 
in addition  unidym has two facilities in northern california  both of which it will continue to occupy until its sunnyvale  ca facility is retrofitted with all of the capabilities that are needed 
the amount of time for which unidym will be obligated under the various leases and the cost for retrofitting is difficult to estimate  as well as the associated costs 
these costs will divert funds from development activities and could place significant financial strain on unidym and the time required to make the retrofits could result in delay in bringing unidym s products to market 
the consolidation included some recent reduction in unidym s management and technical teams and unidym plans to make additional cuts in the near future 
with these cuts  it is possible that valuable know how will be lost and that unidym s development efforts could be negatively affected 
there are substantial inherent risks in attempting to commercialize new technological applications  and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully develop nanotechnology for commercial use 
our company finances research and development of nanotechnology  which is a new and unproven field 
our research scientists are working on developing technology in various stages 
however  such technology s commercial feasibility and acceptance is unknown 
scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes an extremely long time to reach commercial viability  if at all 
to date  our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable applications  and may never do so 
during the research and development process  we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome 
for example  our scientists must determine how to design and develop nanotechnology applications for potential products designed by third parties for use in cost effective manufacturing processes 
because of these uncertainties  it is possible that none of our potential applications will be successfully developed 
if we are unable to successfully develop nanotechnology applications for commercial use  we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business 
we have not generated significant revenues and our business model does not predict significant revenues in the foreseeable future 
to date  we have only generated a small amount of revenue as a result of our current plan of operations 
moreover  given our strategy of financing new and unproven technology research  we do not expect to realize significant revenue from operations in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our applications to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
even if our research and development yields technologically feasible applications  we may not successfully develop commercial products  and even if we do  we may not do so on a timely basis 
if our research efforts are successful on the technology side  it could take at least several years before this technology will be commercially viable 
during this period  superior competitive technologies may be introduced or customer needs may change  which will diminish or extinguish the commercial uses for our applications 
because nanotechnology is an emerging field  the degree to which potential consumers will adopt nanotechnology enabled products is uncertain 
we cannot predict when significant commercial market acceptance for nanotechnology enabled products will develop  if at all  and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market 
if markets fail to accept nanotechnology enabled products  we may not be able to generate revenues from the commercial application of our technologies 
our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce new technological applications to manufacturers for products accepted by customers 
if we are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among original equipment manufacturers and customers  or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to scale up our manufacturing processes in a cost effective way 
in some cases  nanotechnology will require new technological and manufacturing processes that  at this time  are very expensive and subject to error 
there is no assurance that technology and manufacturing processes will expand and improve quickly enough to enable our targeted products to be made within rigorous tolerances cost effectively 
if manufacturing and mass production are not available at a favorable cost  our technology may not be adopted by the applicable industry 
under such scenario  we may not achieve our business plan for one or more process or product  which could adversely impact the value of our common stock 

table of contents we will need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop and market our products 
we do not possess all of the resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies on a mass scale 
unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing  we will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize current and future products 
if we do not find appropriate partners  or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful  our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected 
even if we are able to find collaborative partners  the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control 
in addition  in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration  there are a variety of attendant technical  business and legal risks  including a development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information  potentially enabling the partner to develop products without us or design around our intellectual property  we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or to their marketing and distribution  and disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research  development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources 
the occurrence of any of the above risks could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition 
arrowhead will need to retain a controlling interest  by ownership  contract or otherwise  in calando and unidym in order to avoid being deemed an investment company under the investment company act of companies that have more than us shareholders or are publicly traded in the us or are  or hold themselves out as being  engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities are subject to regulation under the investment company act of unless a substantial part of arrowhead s assets consists of  and a substantial part of arrowhead s income is derived from  interests in majority owned subsidiaries and companies that it primarily controls  whether by contract or otherwise  arrowhead may be required to register and become subject to regulation under the investment company act 
because investment company act regulation is  for the most part  inconsistent with arrowhead s strategy of actively managing and operating its portfolio companies  a requirement to operate its business as a registered investment company would restrict our operations and require additional resources for compliance 
if arrowhead is deemed to be  and is required to register as  an investment company  it will be forced to comply with substantive requirements under the investment company act  including limitations on its ability to borrow  limitations on its capital structure  restrictions on acquisitions of interests in associated companies  prohibitions on transactions with affiliates  restrictions on specific investments  and compliance with reporting  record keeping  voting  proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations 
nanotechnology enabled products are new and may be viewed as being harmful to human health or the environment 
there is public concern regarding the human health  environmental and ethical implications of nanotechnology that could impede market acceptance of products developed through these means 
nanotechnology enabled products could be composed of materials such as carbon  silicon  silicon carbide  germanium  gallium arsenide  gallium nitride  cadmium selenide or indium phosphide  which may prove to be unsafe or harmful human health or to the environment because of the size  shape or composition of the nanostructures 
for this reason  these nanostructures may prove to present risks to human health or the environment that are different from and greater than the better understood risks that may be presented by the constituent materials in non nanoscale forms 
because of the potential  but at this point unknown  risks associated with certain nanomaterials  government authorities in the united states or individual states  and foreign government authorities could  for social or other purposes  prohibit or regulate the use of some or all nanotechnologies 
the united states environmental protection agency has in that regard recently taken steps towards regulation of the manufacture and use of certain nanotechnology enabled materials  including those containing carbon nanotubes or nanosilver 
further  in a just released report  the united states national academy of sciences national research council concluded that the us government needs to develop a more robust and coordinated plan for addressing the potential environmental  health  and safety risks of nanomaterials 
the regulation and limitation of the kinds of materials used in or used to develop nanotechnology enabled products  or the regulation of the products themselves  could halt or delay the commercialization of nanotechnology enabled products or substantially increase the cost  which will impair our ability to achieve revenue from the license of nanotechnology applications 
we may not be able to effectively secure first tier research and development projects when competing against other ventures 
we compete with a substantial number of other companies that fund early stage  scientific research at universities to secure rights to promising technologies 
in addition  and many venture capital firms and other institutional investors invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies 
many of these companies have greater resources than we do 
therefore  we may not be able to secure the opportunity to finance first tier research and commercialization projects 
furthermore  should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful  there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and or technologies 
we rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products 
we rely on third parties for various components and processes for our products  including the manufacture of calando s product candidates 
while we try to have at least two sources for each component and process  we may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source  other companies may choose not to work with us  or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist  or does not exist on acceptable terms 
in addition  due to the recent tightening of global credit and the disruption in the financial markets  there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
therefore  it is possible that our business plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials  components and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost  if at all  or to get a timely response from vendors 
we must overcome the many obstacles associated with integrating and operating varying business ventures to succeed 
our model to integrate and oversee the strategic direction of various subsidiaries and research and development projects presents many risks  including the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel  and the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures 

table of contents if we are unable to timely and efficiently design and integrate administrative and operational support for our subsidiaries  we may be unable to manage projects effectively  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our business objectives and the value of an investment in our company could decline 
in addition  consummating acquisitions and taking advantage of strategic relationships could adversely impact our cash position  and dilute stockholder interests  for many reasons  including changes to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred to fund our growth strategy  and any issuance of securities to fund our operations or growth  which dilutes or lessens the rights of current stockholders 
failure to effectively manage our growth could place strains on our managerial  operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
arrowhead provides managerial and operational support for our subsidiaries 
at times over the course of the company s development  our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
further  as our subsidiaries businesses grow  we will be required to manage multiple relationships 
any further growth by us or our subsidiaries  or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships will increase this strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
this strain may inhibit our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to implement our business plan  and could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  business prospects and operations and the value of an investment in our company 
in the near term  arrowhead has consolidated management responsibilities for our subsidiaries at the arrowhead level 
failure to effectively manage those responsibilities in light of increased responsibilities and the company s financial condition could have a material adverse effect upon the value of the company 
our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees 
in addition  we rely on several key executives to manage each of our subsidiaries 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our executives 
our ability to execute our strategy also will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists  sales  marketing and additional managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we could have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner  or at all 
members of our senior management team and board may have a conflict of interest in also serving as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries 
while we expect that our officers and directors who also serve as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries will comply with their fiduciary duties owed to our stockholders  they may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and the minority stockholders of our subsidiaries 
specifically  dr 
anzalone  our ceo and president is a minority equity holder in and the founder  ceo and board member of nanotope and leonardo 
to the extent that any of our directors choose to recuse themselves from particular board actions to avoid a conflict of interest  the other members of our board will have a greater influence on such decisions 
our research and product development efforts pertaining to the pharmaceutical industry are subject to additional risks 
our subsidiaries  calando and tego  as well as minority investments nanotope and lbs  are focused on research and development projects related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates 
drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
even product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early animal and human clinical trials  often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as clinical trial results are not acceptable  even though preclinical trial results were promising  inefficacy and or harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the fda  did not approve our potential product for the intended use  and manufacturing and distribution is uneconomical 
clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which often delays  limits  or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products 
if calando is unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of their respective biopharmaceutical technology  or if the associated drug products do not achieve wide market acceptance  the business of calando will be materially and adversely affected  and the value of our interest in this subsidiary will diminish 

table of contents any drugs developed by our subsidiaries may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations  third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives  thereby harming our business 
increasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the united states 
both private and government entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs 
numerous proposals that would effect changes in the united states healthcare system have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures  including reductions in the cost of prescription products and changes in the levels at which consumers and healthcare providers are reimbursed for purchases of pharmaceutical products 
the ability of calando  tego and our minority investments nanotope and lbs to market products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which third party payers are willing to reimburse patients for the costs of their products and related treatments 
these third party payers include government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in addition  the trend toward managed healthcare and government insurance programs could result in lower prices and reduced demand for the products of these companies 
cost containment measures instituted by healthcare providers and any general healthcare reform could affect their ability to sell products and may have a material adverse effect on them  thereby diminishing the value of the company s interest in these subsidiaries 
we cannot predict the effect of future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry and third party coverage and reimbursement on our business 
there may be a difference in the investment valuations that we used when making initial and subsequent investments in our subsidiaries and minority investments and actual market values 
our investments in our subsidiaries and minority interests were the result of negotiation with subsidiary management and equity holders  and the investment valuations were not independently verified 
traditional methods used by independent valuation analysts include a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
we have not generated a positive cash flow to date and do not expect to generate significant cash flow in the near future 
additionally  we believe that there exist comparable public companies to provide a meaningful valuation comparison 
accordingly  we have not sought independent valuation analysis in connection with our investments and may have invested in our various holdings at higher or lower valuations than an independent source would have recommended 
there may be no correlation between the investment valuations that we used over the years for our investments and the actual market values 
if we should eventually sell all or a part of any of our consolidated business or that of a subsidiary  the ultimate sale price may be for a value substantially lower or higher than previously determined by us  which could materially and adversely impair the value of our common stock 
risks related to our intellectual property our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain  exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage 
our subsidiaries have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and will continue to file patent applications 
the researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we choose to license 
if a particular patent is not granted  the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished 
further  even if these patents are granted  they may be difficult to enforce 
even if successful  efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive  distracting for management  cause our patents to be invalidated  and frustrate commercialization of products 
additionally  even if patents are issued and are enforceable  others may independently develop similar  superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us  or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others 
thus  the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage 
if we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property  the value of your investment may decline 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to develop and commercialize products based on their respective patent portfolios  will depend  in part  on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to enforce those patents and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any patents that may issue from patent applications owned or licensed by us or any of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient protection to conduct our respective businesses as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted  or that we or our subsidiaries will remain free from infringement claims by third parties 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
because the nanotechnology intellectual property landscape is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary  it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights 
however  we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that  if found to be valid and 
table of contents enforceable  could be alleged to render one or more of our business lines infringing 
if a claim should be brought and is successful  we may be required to pay substantial damages  be forced to abandon any affected business lines and or seek a license from the patent holder 
in addition  any patent infringement claims brought against us or our subsidiaries  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns 
these could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects 
there can also be no assurance that patents owned or licensed by us or our subsidiaries will not be challenged by others 
in addition  if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers  and we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims 
the claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
the technology licensed by our subsidiaries from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institutions 
we license technology from caltech  rice university  and other universities and companies 
our licensors may have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our collaborators often retain certain rights under their agreements with us  including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our collaborators limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 
risks related to regulation of our products we will need approval from governmental authorities in the united states and other countries to successfully realize commercial value from our activities 
in order to clinically test  manufacture and market products for commercial use  two of our current subsidiaries and both of our investments must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies  including the us food and drug administration  or fda 
technology and product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the time and expense required to perform the necessary testing can vary and is substantial 
in addition  no action can be taken to market any biologic  drug or device in the united states until the fda approves an appropriate marketing application 
furthermore  even after initial fda approval has been obtained  further trials may be required to obtain additional data on safety and effectiveness 
adverse events that are reported during regulatory trials or after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on a product s use and  potentially  withdrawal of the product from the market 
any adverse event  either before or after approval  can result in product liability claims against us  which could significantly and adversely impact the value of our common stock 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations 
our operations  including our research and development and our commercialization efforts  such as clinical trials  manufacturing and distribution  are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program  we cannot assure you that our company or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations or laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations or laws  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a commercialized product  significant fines  sanctions  or litigation  any of which could harm our business and financial condition 

table of contents in order to avoid regulation under the investment company act  arrowhead may choose to make additional pro rata investments in unidym to maintain a controlling interest 
if export controls affecting our products are expanded  our business will be adversely affected 
the us government regulates the sale and shipment of numerous technologies by us companies to foreign countries 
our subsidiaries may develop products that might be useful for military and antiterrorism activities 
accordingly  us government export regulations could restrict sales of these products in other countries 
if the us government places burdensome export controls on our technology or products  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
if the us government determines that we have not complied with the applicable export regulations  we may face penalties in the form of fines or other punishment 
risks related to our stock stockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in additional financings 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  on such terms and at such prices as our board of directors may determine 
as of september    shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding 
as of september    shares and  shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option plan  or plan  and equity incentive plan  or plan  respectively 
as of september   options to purchase  shares were outstanding under our plan and options to purchase  shares were outstanding under our plan 
in addition  an inducement grant of an option to purchase  shares of common stock was issued to our ceo as part of his compensation package 
as of september   we had warrants outstanding to purchase  shares of common stock that are callable by us under certain market conditions 
the issuance of additional securities in financing transactions by us or through the exercise of options or warrants would dilute the equity interests of our existing stockholders  perhaps substantially  and might result in dilution in the tangible net book value of a share of our common stock  depending upon the price and other terms on which the additional shares are issued 
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly during fiscal    and and may continue to do so in the future 
because we are a development stage company  there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured 
consequently  we expect that the market price of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate significantly 
we do not expect to generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our nanotechnology for several years  if at all 
in the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance  we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  developments in our strategic relationships with scientists within the nanotechnology field  our ability to enter into or extend investigation phase  development phase  commercialization phase and other agreements with new and or existing partners  announcements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products  market perception and or investor sentiment regarding nanotechnology as the next technological wave  announcements regarding developments in the nanotechnology field in general  the issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights  and quarterly variations in our operating results 
we will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price 
as a result  our stock price may be volatile and any extreme fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
the market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be very limited  and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global market  our securities are currently relatively thinly traded 
our current solvency concerns could serve to exacerbate the thin trading of our securities 
for example  mandatory sales of our common stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our common stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines as a result of the solvency concerns 
accordingly  it may be difficult to sell shares of common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock 
unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock  sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock 
moreover  our stock price has generally been declining for the last months 
although our common stock had a closing market price of as of december   our stock had a closing market value of less than at various points in october  which is in violation of nasdaq s standard continued listing requirements 
nasdaq has temporarily suspended the enforcement of rules requiring a minimum closing bid price  but this suspension is currently only in effect through january  given the volatility of our stock price  there is no guarantee that we will be in compliance with nasdaq s continued listing requirements when this suspension is lifted 
if our stock is trading below when the temporary suspension is lifted  nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against us 
if we were to be delisted  the market liquidity of our common stock would likely be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock would likely decrease 
such a delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in a loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
in addition  our stockholders ability to trade or obtain quotations on our shares could be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays 
these factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask price for our common stock 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business  or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock  our stock price and trading volume may decline 
the trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business 
we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or securities analysts 
investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive coverage from analysts 
if no industry or securities analysts commence coverage of our company  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
in the event we obtain industry or security analyst coverage  if one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fails to publish reports about our company regularly  our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of shares by our management or founding stockholders 
sales of our common stock by our officers  directors and founding stockholders could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of those securities 
additionally  the price of our common stock could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
furthermore  due to relatively low trading volume of our stock  should one or more large stockholders seek to sell a significant portion of its stock in a short period of time  the price of our stock may decline 
we may be the target of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we will not distribute cash to our stockholders until and unless we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan 
the time frame for that is inherently unpredictable  and you should not plan on it occurring in the near future  if at all 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  which may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
specifically  our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  currently has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock 
as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview unless otherwise noted  the term arrowhead refers to arrowhead research corporation  a delaware corporation formerly known as interactive group  inc  the terms the company  we  us  and our  refer to the ongoing business operations of arrowhead and its subsidiaries  whether conducted through arrowhead or a subsidiary of the company arrowhead the term arc refers to arrowhead research corporation  a privately held california corporation with which arrowhead consummated a stock exchange transaction in january  the term subsidiaries refers collectively to calando pharmaceuticals  inc  unidym  inc  agonn systems  inc 
and tego biosciences corporation and the term common stock refers to arrowhead research s common stock and the term stockholder s refers to the holders of common stock or securities exercisable for common stock 
arrowhead is a nanotechnology holding company striving to bring new products to market via its subsidiaries and investments in the healthcare  electronics  and clean energy industries 
our mission is to create shareholder value by building subsidiaries that may be monetized in three primary ways subsidiaries may be sold to other companies with proceeds flowing back to arrowhead  subsidiaries may execute an ipo  with proceeds flowing back to arrowhead and or providing arrowhead with tradable stock  and subsidiaries may become mature operating units with earnings consolidated with arrowhead 
in the near term  we are focused on maximizing the value of our most mature subsidiaries  calando pharmaceuticals  inc and unidym  inc  through internal development  partnership and license arrangements  as well as pursuing new sources of cash investments 
our longer term strategy for development and investment in existing subsidiaries and minority investments will be determined by cash availability and the strength of technology and market opportunity 
arrowhead is continually identifying and developing business opportunities for new areas of investment which may be engaged as capital resources allow 
cash resources as a development stage company  arrowhead has historically financed its operations through the sale of securities of arrowhead and its subsidiaries 
development of products at our subsidiaries  in particular calando and unidym  has required significant capital investment since the company s inception in and will continue to require significant cash investment in fiscal for the company to fund operations at historical levels 
at september   arrowhead had cash on hand of approximately million on a consolidated basis 
the company recognizes that if no additional cash resources are obtained  the company must scale back its cash consumption to remain a going concern 
the board has approved a strategy for the company to conserve cash resources and seek sources of new capital 
to execute on this strategy  the board will seek to accomplish one or more of the following on favorable terms out license of technology  sale of a subsidiary  sale of non core assets  funded joint development or partnership arrangements  and sale of securities 
the company is actively involved in discussions with third parties regarding many of these alternatives 
until such time as one or more of these goals is accomplished  the company will continue to implement streamlining and cash conservation measures begun in fiscal and defer major investment in new initiatives 
if no additional cash is obtained by mid second quarter  the company has a plan to make even deeper cuts in its development efforts at calando and unidym and reduce expenses at arrowhead to insure that the company has cash to fund operations in a limited manner through fiscal and into majority owned subsidiaries arrowhead is highly active in the operation of its subsidiaries  centralizing key management responsibilities at the arrowhead level 
each subsidiary is staffed with its own technical team that focuses on its specific technology and markets  while arrowhead provides initial management and services including operational support  business development and financing 
we believe this provides our subsidiaries with significant competitive advantages 
we previously retained management teams at calando and unidym to manage and grow their operations 
our board of directors determined that independent management teams at calando and unidym required significant cash and reduced the overall efficiency of the companies on a consolidated basis 
during fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal  calando and unidym terminated senior management to conserve cash and consolidate financial and strategic operations at arrowhead 
arrowhead currently has two majority owned subsidiaries  two wholly owned subsidiaries the subsidiaries  and has minority investments in two development stage nanotechnology companies 
the company s subsidiaries seek to commercialize a variety of nanotech products and applications  including anti cancer drugs  rnai therapeutics  carbon based electronics and fullerene anti oxidants 
the company s minority investments are focused on developing advanced nanomaterials for spinal cord injury and wound healing and drug delivery technology 
in fiscal  the company took significant steps to streamline operations at each of its majority owned subsidiaries and to consolidate management at the arrowhead level 
the company expects to continue this trend into fiscal at september   the company had two majority owned  operating subsidiaries  calando pharmaceuticals  inc calando and unidym  inc unidym  formerly nanopolaris  inc  and two wholly owned subsidiaries  tego biosciences corporation tego and agonn systems  inc agonn 
in fiscal  the company acquired minority interest in two other nanotechnology companies  nanotope  inc nanotope and leonardo biosystems  inc leonardo arrowhead s business plan includes adding to its portfolio through selective acquisition and formation of new companies 
as part of its model  the company expects to create or acquire subsidiaries to commercialize promising technologies  close a subsidiary based upon lack of technical or business progress or sell a subsidiary if an attractive offer is received 

table of contents calando in the second quarter of fiscal  the company merged two majority owned subsidiaries  insert therapeutics  inc and calando to bring both drug delivery platforms into the same company 
the merged company is operating under the name calando pharmaceuticals  inc at the same time  calando shifted focus from preclinical and pipeline development to emphasize its clinical program 
consequently  calando s operations were streamlined by reductions in executive and technical staff and the two facilities were consolidated 
in connection with the reduction in calando s executive management  arrowhead took over the management of calando 
these actions reduced the consumption of cash for salaries and facilities  however  significant cash was consumed in fiscal in preparations to enter a second clinical trial  clinical trial expenses for calando s phase i study  and the development of a second rnai therapeutic 
since the merger in april  arrowhead has made a series of cash advances totaling approximately million to fund calando s operations 
calando s cash consumption fluctuates from quarter to quarter depending on the progress of its projects  but in fiscal  it has ranged between million and million per quarter 
if calando is unsuccessful in attracting additional capital and arrowhead does not have sufficient cash resources to support calando s operations  some or all of calando s development projects would have to be scaled back  interrupted  or abandoned in order to manage cash so that calando limited operations through fiscal and into subsequent to september   calando raised million of additional funds through the sale of senior unsecured convertible promissory notes new notes of which million has been received  in which financing  arrowhead participated by buying  of the new notes and agreeing to subordinate principal and interest on arrowhead s million of demand notes to the new notes sold 
the new notes have a year maturity and bear interest compounded annually 
unpaid principal of the note and accrued but unpaid interest thereon is convertible into common stock of calando at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment  at any time in the sole discretion of the holder 
in the event of a defined sale event holders of new notes have other exchange and conversion options 
calando pharmaceuticals is arrowhead s most mature biopharmaceutical subsidiary 
based on technology developed at the california institute of technology  calando s proprietary linear cyclodextrin nanoparticle technology is designed to deliver small molecule drugs using calando s cyclosert tm system and rnai therapeutics using the rondel tm system 
using these platform systems  calando has developed two anti cancer drug candidates that are currently undergoing human clinical trials 
the company believes that calando is an attractive near term partnership candidate or acquisition target for several pharmaceutical and biotech companies that are active in the development of rnai therapeutics 
systemic delivery has posed a major hurdle to the clinical development of sirna therapeutics 
calando is in ongoing discussions with multiple potential partners and acquirers 
calando s rondel enabled sirna based therapeutic  calaa  is currently undergoing a phase i clinical trial in patients with solid tumors at the ucla jonsson cancer center in los angeles  california  and at south texas accelerated research therapeutics start in san antonio  texas 
calaa targets the expression of the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  a clinically validated cancer target 
to our knowledge  calando is the first and only company with a clinical stage systemic delivery system enabled sirna therapeutic 
further  we believe calaa is also the only clinical stage sirna therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cancer 
although this study has only recently begun  it has progressed without complications 
additionally  calando is performing preclinical studies on calaa  a second rondel enabled anti cancer sirna therapeutic candidate targeting expression of the hypoxia inducible factor alpha gene 
calando s other nano engineered polymer delivery system  cyclosert  is designed to deliver small molecule drugs and peptides 
it  calando s first clinical small molecule candidate  is a combination of cyclosert and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer therapeutic 
a phase i trial for it was completed in october all phase i trial endpoints were successfully achieved 
the drug was found to be well tolerated in both the phase ia and ib studies of the trial 
in addition  a high proportion of patients displayed stable disease following treatment 
based on these encouraging phase i results  calando has opened a phase ii trial for ovarian cancer 
we believe there is opportunity to derive additional value from the further development of cyclosert and rondel systems  as they have been demonstrated to enhance and enable the delivery of multiple pharmaceutical entities  including peptides and small molecules as well as other rna and dna based oligonucleotides 
calaa is being developed to demonstrate the fast track to the clinic that can be provided by the rondel system 
also  calando is applying its library of cyclosert linkers to develop new conjugate oncology therapeutics with the goal of improving the efficacy and side effect profile of generic and in licensed compounds 
ultimately  the company believes calando provides a platform opportunity that could enable the creation of multiple new drug candidates 
continuation of calando clinical and pipeline candidates could be limited by the capital resources available 
in order to fund continued development  subsequent to september   calando has signed agreements to issue million in new notes of which million has been received and is seeking an additional million 
if calando is unable to secure additional funding  and arrowhead has insufficient capital to loan or invest in calando  calando s development efforts could be slowed or interrupted 
arrowhead owns of the outstanding stock of calando 
if calando raises substantial outside capital to fund operations  arrowhead s ownership interest could be diluted 
calando s efforts on calaa  it and its other pipeline candidates are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 

there are numerous technical  regulatory and marketing challenges that must be overcome to successfully commercialize calando s products  including  but not limited to the following advancing calando s pipeline candidates requires extensive preclinical testing and approval by the fda is required before clinical testing can commence 
advancing calando s therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical testing is expensive and takes a long time 
complications may arise that would cause the clinical testing to be interrupted or stopped 
fda approval is required before calando s products could be sold 
even if fda approval is eventually obtained  there is no assurance that it will be accepted by the medical community 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of calando s development projects  the completion dates  or when or if revenue will commence 
unidym unidym raised a total of million of equity financing in fiscal in fiscal  unidym consumed large amounts of cash to scale up the manufacture of carbon nanotubes  scale up for the production and sale its first carbon nanotube based film product  acquire another nanotech company  expand its business development activities  and prepare for an initial public offering 
in the first and second quarters of fiscal  unidym expanded its executive  technical and administrative staff for these activities 
unidym s cash burn ramped from million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter  it was clear that unidym would be unable to meet its fund raising goals to support its cash needs 
moreover  technical development took longer than expected 
additionally  it became evident that dramatic change in the financial market would not allow an initial public offering 
starting in october  several general and administrative positions were eliminated 
approximately  half of its team in its houston  tx facility was put on unpaid leave to conserve cash 
further cuts to personnel and consolidation of facilities are planned to bring unidym s cash burn to of its high water mark in fourth quarter however  unidym will still need to obtain additional cash to fund its operations and obligations through fiscal subsequent to september   unidym raised million from the sale of series c preferred stock to tel ventures 
the sale of these securities was associated with unidym s entry into a security agreement granting tel a security interest in unidym s physical and intellectual property the collateral  which  however  excludes unidym s rights under the rice license and shares of ensysce biosciences  inc 
the subscription agreement provided tel with two put options 
tel may exercise the first put option if unidym fails to enter into a joint development agreement with tel by june  in that case  unidym must buy back tel s unidym shares for million before march tel may exercise the second option if unidym fails to meet certain cash requirements by june  those requirements would be met if unidym raises million through any combination of a sale of its equity  the sale or license of some or all of its assets and businesses including positions in ensysce biosciences  nexeon medsystems or nanocondution  or sales of products 
only if tel exercises this put option between june and july   shall unidym be obligated to repurchase the series c preferred stock for million within ten days notification of exercise 
in the event of a default under the security agreement  eg  inability to pay either of the put options  bankruptcy  admission of inability to pay its bills  tel can take possession of the collateral and keep net proceeds of any sale thereof 
a material portion of unidym s intellectual property portfolio is exclusively licensed from rice university 
if the sum of unidym s debts  liabilities and other obligations is greater than all of unidym s assets at fair valuation or if unidym is generally not paying its debts  liabilities and other obligations as they come due  the rice license would terminate 
unidym is the company s most mature nanomaterials company and provides an example of a company building strategy that arrowhead plans to replicate in other areas of nanotechnology 
through the acquisition of a foundational intellectual property portfolio in the manufacture and applications of carbon nanotubes cnts  unidym has developed a strong technology base in cnt technology that we believe can serve as a platform for innovation and new products 
unidym has already developed world leading high performance carbon nanotube materials manufactured by scalable processes 
unidym s product development efforts are focused on the electronics industry  where there is continuing demand for higher performance materials 
unidym s product development has been focused on thin  transparent film of carbon nanotubes on a flexible substrate 
unidym is also working with leading lcd companies  including a joint development agreement with samsung electronics  to incorporate cnt films into their display devices 
through its various collaborations  unidym has also fabricated prototype lcd and electrophoretic displays incorporating cnt based films 

table of contents the capital expenditures associated with cnt synthesis are kept low by both the scalability of unidym s cnt synthesis process and the fact that only trace amounts of cnts are required per unit area of film 
additionally  unidym can leverage the substantial excess capacity left in the coating industry by the decrease in demand for photographic film 
for its initial product offering to touch panel makers  unidym is currently evaluating the most favorable business model to pursue 
in one model  unidym would synthesize cnts  formulate those cnts into a coating ink  and outsource production of the films to a toll coater to produce the film 
unidym would pay for production of the films on a time and materials basis  and unidym would directly market and sell the films to touch panel makers 
under a second model that is less capital intensive  unidym would synthesize cnts and cnt inks  and then ship the inks to company that would manufacture and sell films to touch panel makers 
unidym s facilities in houston  texas have historically provided bulk cnt materials to customers primarily for research or early commercial prototyping processes 
this activity has provided modest revenues for unidym 
the lease on the houston facility has been terminated and unidym must vacate the premises in the near future 
unidym has decided not to occupy its new facility in houston and is currently evaluating whether to continue to sell bulk cnt materials 
the facility in houston also provides materials for unidym s cnt film product 
unidym is currently exploring more cost effective alternatives to produce cnts for its film product than operating its houston facility 
alternatives include moving its production capabilities to its sunnyvale facility or outsourcing cnt production to a third party 
if unidym decides to move its production capabilities for cnts sunnyvale  it will incur significant costs for the retrofit and the time required could result in a delay in bringing unidym s products to market and an interruption or cessation of unidym s revenues 
development  production and sale of unidym s products have required and is expected to continue to require significant investment and to take a long time 
there are a variety of technical  cost  and marketing barriers that must be overcome 
it is not possible at this time to predict the final cost of developing unidym s transparent conductive film or other cnt products  the final cost of scaling up the production process  when or if unidym will generate significant licensing revenue  or when or if unidym will become profitable 
in july  unidym acquired nanoconduction  inc  a sunnyvale  ca company developing nano based electronic cooling technology nanoconduction 
the merger provides unidym with access to nanoconduction s patent portfolio  which will supplement unidym s existing patent portfolio and provides unidym with additional opportunities to out license and leverage its technology 
in addition  through the merger  unidym will gain access to research facilities and equipment that will be used in unidym s ongoing research and development activities 
unidym accomplished the acquisition of nanoconduction through an equity exchange  as follows 
arrowhead invested  in unidym through a cashless investment by issuing  shares of unregistered common stock to the owners of nanocondution 
in exchange for this investment  the company received  additional shares of series c preferred stock of unidym 
as additional consideration  unidym agreed to assume and discharge nanoconduction s assets and liabilities 
assets included equipment and leasehold improvements with an estimated net book value of approximately million including intellectual property related to the use of carbon nanotubes for thermal management 
liabilities included approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and approximately million in capital equipment loans 
the equipment loans are guaranteed by unidym and secured by a lien on nanoconduction assets 
unidym entered into a new five year lease for the facilities currently occupied by nanoconduction in sunnyvale  california  with the intention of moving unidym s existing menlo park operations to the nanoconduction facility 
in march  unidym sub licensed certain of its intellectual property to ensysce biosciences inc ensysce whose focus is research into the medical therapeutic applications of carbon nanotubes 
from march to november  ensysce was both funded and effectively controlled by a related party to unidym who also serves as a director of unidym 
in november  unidym sold its percent interest in ensysce to the controlling shareholder for  and will recognize a gain on the sale during the first quarter of fiscal tego tego s primary asset is an intellectual property portfolio that includes key patents for the modification of fullerenes 
tego does not control the intellectual property relating to making fullerenes  however we believe that it does control key patents that are critical in making fullerenes into useable products 
we believe tego is in a position to monetize its proprietary compounds and enabling patents through a licensing and partnership model 
currently  tego has no employees or facilities and its technical and business development is handled at the arrowhead level 
tego is in discussions with other companies regarding potential partnerships and licenses which could enable arrowhead to capture value via near term revenue  as well as long term royalties 
tego s development and licensing activities are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of developing or licensing tego s technology  the completion date  or when or if revenue will commence 
agonn agonn systems corporation is arrowhead s newest subsidiary  formed in to develop and commercialize nanotechnology based energy storage devices for electric vehicles and other large format applications 
agonn is pursuing a strategy to acquire energy storage technologies based on nanoscale engineering from research institutions 
agonn has outsourced the development of prototype ultracapacitors based on carbon nanomaterials and other advanced materials 
we believe the markets for energy storage products are substantial  ranging from consumer electronics to vehicles to heavy industry and that emerging clean technology platforms offer significant market opportunities for new energy storage devices  in part because traditional batteries do not meet many of the key requirements for energy density  lifetime and efficiency 
agonn has no facilities or employees and is managed entirely by arrowhead 
at september   agonn was a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company expects that this ownership interest may be diluted in the future with the issuance of equity to strategic partners 
agonn s research and development activities are preliminary  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
it is not possible at this time to accurately determine the final cost of developing agonn s technology  the completion date  or when or if revenue will commence 
minority investments nanotope nanotope is a company in the field of regenerative medicine developing a suite of products customized to regenerate specific tissues  including neuronal  vascular  bone  myocardial  and cartilage 
its two lead candidates are focused on spinal cord regeneration and treatment of peripheral artery disease 

table of contents the company acquired its initial stake in nanotope from a nanotope shareholder in april and increased its position through a direct in investment of m in two tranches of million each in july and september at september   the company owned of nanotope s outstanding securities

aonex discontinued operation in  arrowhead determined that in order to monetize its investment in majority owned subsidiary aonex technologies  inc  it should seek to partner its technology with another company with greater financial resources and market reach 
in may  arrowhead sold its stake in aonex to new hampshire based amberwave systems  inc for upfront and milestone payments of up to million plus a royalty on solar products or licenses 
amberwave took over aonex s pasadena  california operations and is continuing to develop aonex s technology 
the losses incurred by aonex are segregated in the consolidated statement of operations as loss from discontinued operation aonex 
academic partnerships in prior years  arrowhead devoted significant capital resources to sponsored research 
as the subsidiaries have matured  the company has decreased its reliance on sponsored research for technology development and sponsored research expense has decreased 
as of september   arrowhead had one active sponsored research agreement at duke university through unidym 
depending on capital resources  arrowhead is likely to continue to invest in nanoscience research and development through sponsored research agreements at universities 
factors affecting further r d expenses the company expects that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as it adds personnel  expands its pre clinical research  begins clinical trial activities  and increases its regulatory compliance capabilities 
the amount of these increases is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing and extent of progress in the company s research programs 
as the company s research efforts mature  it will continue to review the direction of its research based on an assessment of the value of possible commercial applications emerging from these efforts 
in addition to these general factors  specific factors that will determine the eventual cost to complete the current projects at calando include the following the number  size and duration of clinical trials required to gain fda approval  the costs of producing supplies of the drug candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidate  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
it is possible that the completion of studies could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including difficulties in enrolling patients  delays in manufacturing  incomplete or inconsistent data from the pre clinical or clinical trials  and difficulties evaluating the trial results 
any delay in completion of a trial would increase the cost of that trial  which would harm the company s results of operations 
due to these uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the size  nature nor timing of the costs to complete  or the amount or timing of the net cash inflows from insert or calando s current activities 
until the company obtains further relevant pre clinical and clinical data  it will not be able to estimate its future expenses related to the subsidiaries programs or when  if ever  and to what extent  the company will receive cash inflows from resulting products

results of operations the company had a consolidated loss of approximately million for the year ended september   compared to a consolidated loss of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in the fiscal consolidated loss over fiscal and fiscal is the result of a number of factors 
first  there was a non recurring expense of  in for purchased in process research and development related to unidym s merger with cni 
secondly  there was a reduction of approximately million in calando s fiscal outside lab and contract services expense 
calando incurred major expenses during fiscal related to preclinical research  preparation for the filing of its investigational new drug application ind with the us food and drug administration  fda for calaa  obtaining sufficient drug inventories to be able to enter phase i clinical trials with calaa  and payment for preparation required to enter the trials 
with the initiation of the phase i trial for calaa  the need in to incur outside labs and contract service expenses was reduced 
salary expense continued to increase in fiscal as the company bolstered its management team at arrowhead and unidym 
unidym s rapid growth started in july of and accelerated with the merger with cni in april 
table of contents in and  staff increased at calando to accommodate the increase in development efforts of new products and of the ind to be filed by calando 
also in fiscal  legal expenses increased as the company completed the merger with cni  a private placement for calando and a private placement for arrowhead 
in fiscal  significant expense is expected to be incurred in the manufacture of the components for calaa  preparation for an ind for calaa and the continuation of calando s clinical trials 
continued clinical and preclinical development of calando s drug candidates will depend on the cash resources available to calando 
significant expense is expected to be incurred in the further development of unidym s products 
it is expected that an alternative source for carbon nanotubes will be identified or manufacture of carbon nanotubes will be consolidated with unidym s product development facility in california 
this is expected to result in reduced cash consumption in texas which would be partially offset by costs necessary to relocate the production capability in california 
the goal is to reduce development costs at unidym substantially and the pace of development will depend on the cash resources available to unidym 
it is expected that the trend to consolidate management of the subsidiaries at arrowhead will continue with the goal to reduce cash outlay throughout the company 
revenues the company generated revenues of   and  for the three years ended september   and  respectively 
the revenue for the year ended september  consists of  from grants to fund research for the development of carbon nanotube applications   from license fees from unidym technology  and  from the sale and delivery of carbon nanotubes to third parties 
the revenue for fiscal consists of  from grants to fund research for the development of carbon nanotube applications   from the sale and delivery of carbon nanotubes to third parties and  for in residual funded research 
the  of revenue in resulted from a commercial license fees when calando granted an exclusive worldwide license to benitec ltd 
asx blt for the combination of calando s polymeric rnai delivery technology with benitec s rnai based therapeutic for the hepatitis c virus 
the license was terminated by mutual agreement in july revenues in cannot be estimated as unidym is re evaluating its strategy with regard to the sale of bulk carbon nanotubes and it is not clear when unidym may have revenue from film sales 
operating expenses the analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the company within the major expense categories 
for purposes of comparison  the amounts for the three years ended september   and  are shown in the tables below 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the amounts for each period have been adjusted to include the adoption of sfas r and the sale of aonex and its inclusion in discontinued operations 
salary wage expenses arrowhead employs management  administrative and technical staff at the arrowhead corporate offices and the subsidiaries 
salary and wage expense consists of salary  benefits  and non cash charges related to equity based compensation in the form of stock options 
salary and benefits are allocated to two major categories general and administrative compensation related expense and research and development compensation related expense depending on the primary activities of each employee 
the following table details salary and related expenses for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in thousands year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category year ended september  of expense category g a compensation related stock based compensation r d compensation related total in reviewing comparative information from year to year  it is helpful to understand that since inception in may and hiring its first employee in mid  the company founded aonex april  nanopolaris april  calando february  nanotechnica september and closed in june  acquired insert june and unidym june and merged unidym with nanopolaris july and later merged unidym with carbon nanotechnologies  inc april unidym hired two senior technical employees from nanoconduction after the acquisition 
during fiscal  arrowhead also acquired the intellectual property of c sixty april that is held in tego biosciences corporation june which expanded its operations beginning in october the merger of unidym and cni added about employees to the payroll in april and unidym continued to expand its operations  research and management team throughout in anticipation of its becoming a self sustaining  independent operation 
in november  insert and calando reduced technical and administrative staff by ten employees in preparation for the merger between calando and insert that was completed in april 
table of contents salary and wage expenses fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative g a compensation expense increased compared to due to the hiring in order to fill several new positions 
positions hired included chief executive officers at arrowhead december  unidym june and calando november 
arrowhead has also added a vice president  medical technologies february  a chief patent officer april and a vice president  advanced materials may 
unidym hired the new employees in the positions of vice president of business development july  chief financial officer september  vice president of finance october  corporate controller april  vice president of marketing may and additional scientific and administrative staff 
tego hired the new position of vice president of finance december 
the increase in g a salaries also includes the impact of the annual pay increases for existing staff 
the company and its subsidiaries will continue to selectively hire additional executives and administrative staff consistent with its business strategies and operational needs 
in fiscal  the company accrued the cost of the severance approximately million to be paid to two arrowhead executives upon their departure from the company over periods ranging from one to three years 
this charge is non cash until paid but is included in g a compensation for fiscal in fiscal  the severance agreement with one executive was terminated and the executive and the company entered into an employment contract which expires in january subsequent to september   in response to the changes in capital markets and the world wide economy  unidym has reduced its rate of cash consumption by reducing administrative overhead 
the reductions included the ceo  cfo  vp of finance  corporate controller  vice president of sales and marketing and plant controller positions 
these responsibilities have been absorbed by remaining unidym employees or existing arrowhead administrative and finance personnel 
further reductions in unidym s staff are expected 
in february  prior to the april merger with calando  insert s ceo and executive vice president positions were eliminated 
severance and release agreements resulted in each executive receiving additional compensation totaling approximately  which was partially offset by the termination of the severance agreement with one arrowhead executive approximately 
stock based compensation is a non cash charge related to the issuance and vesting of stock options to new and existing employees 
this expense is recorded pursuant to the adoption of sfas r  which requires expensing of stock based compensation for all options vested 
stock options are awarded to new full time employees and to existing employees

if the company adds facilities  insurance expense will increase 
current projections for fiscal foresee a decrease in locations for unidym and no addition of facilities for other subsidiaries which could result in a decrease in insurance expense 
however  such decrease could be offset by additional clinical trial insurance required to cover potential liabilities resulting from calando s clinical activities 
the increase in communications and technology expense for the year compared to the prior year is primarily related to the addition of two unidym locations  the purchase of equipment for new employees  and configuration of data networks among menlo park  california  and pasadena  california  and houston  texas

the increase in unidym expenses is related to the scale up of the operations to develop the manufacturing processes for carbon nanotubes and thin film conductive materials 
development expenses for unidym are expected to decrease in as unidym develops a less costly source of cnt materials than operating the houston facility 
efforts were focused on the sale of unidym s carbon nanotube based inks rather than manufacture of film which is expected to be less expensive and a partner will be sought for the manufacture of unidym s film 
outside laboratory contract services expenses will continue to fluctuate depending upon where a particular project is in its development  approval or trial process 
licensing fees  milestones royalties consist primarily of amounts paid by calando for the license for sirna targets from alnylam and the milestone payments due with the submission of the inda

the use of consultants with diverse backgrounds enabled the company to accomplish various objectives without having to add full time staff and is expected to continue in fiscal leveraged technology and revenue strategy arrowhead continues to follow its strategy to leverage technology that is being or has been developed at universities 
by doing so  arrowhead benefits from work done at those universities and through majority owned subsidiaries  which can commercialize the most promising technologies developed from sponsored research and other sources 
the subsidiaries are likely to produce prototypes to advance their strategies 
the subsidiaries have three primary strategies to potentially generate product sales revenue license the products and processes to a third party for a royalty or other payment 
by licensing  the company would not be required to allocate resources to build a sales or a production infrastructure and could use those resources to develop additional products 
retain the rights to the products and processes  but contract with a third party for production 
the company would then market the finished products 
this approach would require either the establishment of a sales and distribution network or collaboration with a supplier who has an established sales and distribution network  but would not require investment in production equipment 
build production capability in order to produce and market the end products 
this last approach would likely require the most capital to build the production  sales and distribution infrastructure 
on a case by case basis  the company and each subsidiary will choose the strategy which  in the opinion of management  can be supported by available capital resources and is likely to generate the most favorable return 
on april   unidym and cni merged 
unidym then had the production capability to make carbon nanotubes that it uses internally for product development and sells externally to third parties 
prior to this merger  the only revenue generated by the company was through grants from public and private entities and through one licensing deal 
while the ultimate goal of the company is to generate revenue through the sale of products and or the licensing of technology  the company does record revenue from grants and from development fees 
revenue from grants and development fees are considered to be reimbursements for efforts performed on behalf of third parties and not part of the company s primary strategy to generate revenue 
unidym generated combined revenues from grants and sales of carbon nanotubes totaling approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal the remaining revenue of  was from a calando grant 

table of contents in fiscal  calando generated approximately  in revenue applicable to a license with benitec ltd 
for the combination of calando s polymeric rna interference rnai delivery technology with benitec s rnai based therapeutic for the hepatitis c virus hcv 
the license was signed in june and called for an upfront fee of  per year and reimbursement for development expenses that calando incurred on benitec s behalf 
the fee was paid in fiscal  at which time calando booked the revenue 
on july   the license agreement with benitec was terminated by mutual agreement 
also in fiscal  aonex recognized revenue of about  related to an sbir grant and other research fees 
during fiscal  arrowhead was told by the small business administration that it no longer qualified as a small business because it could not show that of its shareholders were us citizens or legal resident aliens 
therefore  the company does not expect to receive any small business funding in the future 
the company does not expect substantial product sales in fiscal therefore  losses can be expected to increase before any substantial revenue is generated 
to partially offset these losses  the company is pursuing other means of funding such as licenses  contracts and collaborations with third parties 
the award of such grants and contracts depends on numerous factors  many of which are not in the company s control and  therefore  it is difficult to predict if this strategy will be successful 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow position since inception in may  the company has incurred significant losses 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million at september  to million at september  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  us government obligations and high grade commercial paper

also in the first quarter of fiscal  unidym sold its equity interest in ensysce biosciences inc for  we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec covering the public sale by the company of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
if the company meets the market capital requirements in the future  it may seek to sell securities from this shelf registration statement to investors 
the board has approved a strategy for the company to conserve cash and seek sources of new capital 
to execute this strategy  the board will seek to accomplish one or more of the following on favorable terms the out license of technology  sale of a subsidiary  sale of non core assets  scaling down development efforts  funded joint development or partnership arrangements  and sale of securities 
the probability that any of these events will occur is uncertain  especially in light of the lack of liquidity in the current capital and credit markets 
until such time as one or more of these goals is accomplished  the company has scaled back the activities at its subsidiaries contractual obligations and commercial commitments unidym incurred various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in connection with the acquisition of nanoconduction 
in addition  our subsidiaries incurred contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of their businesses 
they consist of the following operating lease obligations in connection with its acquisition of nanoconduction  unidym guaranteed an equipment lease of  bearing interest at with a remaining principal balance of  as of september  the lease requires monthly payments of principal and interest of  each through july  the equipment lease is secured by research and development assets at nanoconduction 
patents and licenses our subsidiaries have entered into various licensing agreements requiring royalty payments of specified product sales 
some of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments in connection with conducting phase ia and ib trials  in the normal course of business  calando incurred purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for materials and supplies or for manufacture of therapeutic agents  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
calando is committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us
