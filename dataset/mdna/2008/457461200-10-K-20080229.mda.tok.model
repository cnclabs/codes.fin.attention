data in this section is presented in thousands  except per share data and square footage data 
this section provides the following an executive summary and our strategies and objectives  the critical accounting policies that impact the treatment  for financial statement purposes  of certain items such as how we value our investment properties  recognize rental income and depreciate our assets  a discussion of our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows and how the changes in balance sheet and cash flow items from year to year impact our liquidity and capital resources  and a discussion of our results of operations  including changes in funds from operations ffo from year to year and a discussion of the impact that inflation may have on our results 
we have qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ending december  so long as we qualify for treatment as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet the requirements of the tests imposed by the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
we are now permitted to participate in certain activities from which we were previously precluded in order to maintain our qualifications as a reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs under the code 
in  we formed a trs  inland venture corporation ivc  to be a partner in many of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
as such  we are subject to federal and state income taxes on the income we receive from the activities of ivc 
the provision for income tax relates to the taxable income of ivc and represents an effective federal and state income tax rate of 
executive summary we are an owner operator of neighborhood  community  power  lifestyle and single tenant retail centers 
we are a self administered reit incorporated under maryland law 
we also may construct or develop properties or render services in connection with such development or construction 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
essentially all of our revenues and cash flows are generated by collecting rental payments from our tenants 
our goal is to continue increasing our revenues by acquiring additional investment properties and re leasing those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at existing properties  at more favorable rental rates 
during the year ended december   we executed new and renewal leases  aggregating approximately  square feet 
the new leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expiring rate 
the renewal leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expiring rate 
during  there are leases expiring which comprise approximately  square feet and account for approximately of our annualized base rent 
we will attempt to renew or re leas e these spaces at more favorable rental rates to provide increased cash flows 
we believe we have significant acquisition opportunities due to our reputation and our concentration of properties in the chicago and minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan areas 
we will use cash provided by our dividend reinvestment plan  draws on our line of credit and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders to continue purchasing additional investment properties 
additionally  we believe we have the ability to obtain financing proceeds of at least  from currently unencumbered investment properties 
however  our outstanding debt may be limited under our keybank line of credit covenants  which may limit our ability to borrow funds 
our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties as well as the interest expense on our mortgages payable and other debt obligations 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
pursuant to the lease agreements  tenants of the property are required to reimburse us for some or all of the particular tenant s pro rata share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the property 
we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to that of other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit  an industry trade group  has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
addition ally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations  calculated in accordance with us gaap  excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization  and gains losses on non operating property 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it neither reflects the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor reflects trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we look at several factors to measure our operating performance to measure our operating results to those of other retail real estate owners operators in our area  we compare occupancy percentage  and our rental rates to the average rents charged by our competitors in similar centers 
to measure our operating results to those of other reits  we compare company wide growth in income or ffo  same store growth in income  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of investment in properties 
based on the above measures  we have historically performed comparably with those in our property sector peer group 
there are costs and issues associated with re leasing our properties  including length of time required to fill vacancies  possibly releasing at rental rates lower than current market rates  leasing costs associated with the new lease such as leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  and paying operating expenses without tenant reimbursements 
strategies and objectives our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our commitment to operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  management and leasing of our properties 
we focus on the following areas in order to achieve our objectives acquisitions we seek to selectively acquire well located open air retail centers 
we acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers 
we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
additionally  we are able to get existing retailers to lease more space at our current investment properties 
joint ventures we actively pursue new development opportunities through joint ventures with established local developers 
we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be re developed and vacant land to be developed 
we earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
we have formed a joint venture to acquire properties that will ultimately be sold through an offering of tenant in common interests in properties to investors 
we earn fees from the joint venture for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities 
we improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
we emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
we maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
we proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities 
development joint ventures for ground up developments  we are utilizing a disciplined partnership strategy that diversifies our risk 
we believe that our in place development joint ventures are a productive use of our capital  providing accretive stabilized returns on development cost 
we believe the joint ventures we have formed with five established development teams are capital efficient  provide attractive returns  and provide us with the option to acquire finished assets at a discount to the current market cap rate or sell them for a profit

wayne in savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il critical accounting policies general a critical accounting policy is one that  we believe  would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and allocation of investment properties  determining whether assets are held for sale  recognition of rental income and lease termination income  our cost capitalization and depreciation policies and consolidation equity accounting policies 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
us gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties that were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies and t he likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
valuation and allocation of investment properties 
on a quarterly basis  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we review impairment indicators and  if necessary  conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value 
we evaluate our investment properties to assess whether any impairment indicators are present  including recurring operating losses and significant adverse changes in legal factors or business climate 
if an investment property is considered impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an impairment loss of related to a  square foot single user retail center located in decatur  illinois 
no such losses were required or recorded in the accompanying financial statements a s of and for the years ended december  and in determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired  management considers several factors  such as projected rental and vacancy rates  property operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest rates 
the capitalization rate used to determine property valuation is based on the market in which the property is located  length of leases  tenant financial strength  the economy in general  demographics  environment  property location  visibility  age  physical condition and investor return requirements among others 
market capitalization rates fluctuate based on factors such as interest rates 
an increase in capitalization rates might result in a market valuation lower than our original purchase price 
additionally  we obtain an appraisal prepared by a third party at the time we purchase the investment property 
all of the aforementioned factors are considered by man agement in determining the value of any particular property 
the value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors  either individually or taken as a whole 
should the actual results differ from management s judgment  the valuation could be negatively or positively affected 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any financing assumed that is determined to be above or below market terms 
the allocation of the purchase price is an area that requires complex judgments and significant estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
we use the information contained in the third party appraisals as the primary basis for allocating the purchase price between land  building and improvements 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the value of the acquired above and below market leases is amortized over the life of the related lease s as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the average lease term as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 
the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
cost capitalization and depreciation policies 
we review all expenditures and capitalize any item that is deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement 
if we capitalize more expenditures  current depreciation expense would be higher  however  total current expenses would be lower 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method 
buildings and improvements are depreciated based upon estimated useful lives of years for buildings and improvements  years for site improvements and the remaining life of the related lease for tenant improvements 
assets held for sale 
in determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale  we consider whether i management has committed to a plan to sell the asset  ii the asset is available for immediate sale  in its present condition  iii we have initiated a program to locate a buyer  iv we believe that the sale of the asset is probable  v we have received a significant non refundable deposit for the purchase of the property  vi we are actively marketing the asset for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value  and vii actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan 
if all of the above criteria are met  we classify the asset as held for sale 
on the day that these criteria are met  we suspend depreciation on the assets held for sale  including depreciation for tenant improvements and additions  as well as on the amortization of acquired in place leases and customer relationship values 
the assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period 
additionally  the operations for the periods presented are classified on the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under us gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanyin g consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectibility of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we have reason to believe will be uncollectible  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculation by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 
as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
recognition of lease termination income 
we accrue lease termination income if there is a signed termination agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property 
consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are either the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or have substantial influence and control of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual returns 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate an entity  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a variable interest entity are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or we do not control the joint venture  we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture are not consolidated with our operations but instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
investment in securities 
we classify our investment in securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
investment in securities at december  and consists of preferred and common stock investments that are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
a decline in the market value of any avai lable for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary  results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or sfas no 
and eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  for an impaired security we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of the investee 
liquidity and capital resources this section describes our balance sheet and discusses our liquidity and capital commitments 
our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents which consists of cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during  and we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance covera ge 
we believe that the risk is not significant  as we do not anticipate the financial institutions non performance 
income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities under our dividend reinvestment plan drp  our draws on the line of credit with keybank na  which may be limited due to covenant compliance requirements  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders 
our line of credit with keybank na matures on april  this line of credit has a one year extension option 
as of december   we had approximately  available under our  line of credit 
if necessary  such as for new acquisitions  we believe we can generate cash flow by entering into financing arrangements or joint venture agreements with institutional investors 
during the year ended december   we issued  aggregate principal amount of convert ible notes due in net proceeds from the convertible notes were used to pay down our line of credit with keybank na by  and we also repurchased  shares of our common stock at a price equal to per share approximately  in the aggregate 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating expenses at our investment properties  for purchasing additional investment properties  joint venture commitments and to repay draws on the line of credit 
certain joint venture commitments require us to invest cash in non operating property under development and in properties that do not necessarily meet our investment criteria but which are offered for syndication through our joint venture with inland real estate exchange corporation 
capital could be committed for periods longer than expected if development timelines are longer or syndication velocity is slower than anticipated 
we invest in marketable securities of other reits as well as non reit entities 
we had investments in securities of  at december   consisting of preferred and common stock investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss of  related to these securities 
realized gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities are specifically identified and determined 
during the year ended december  and  we realized gains on sale of and  respectively 
additionally  during the year ended december   the company realized a loss of related to a decline in value of certain investment securities which were determined to be other than temporary 
the overall stock market and reit stocks have declined over the last few months and although these investment have generated both current income and gain on sale during the year ended december   there is no assurance that existing or future investments will generate any income or gains due to economic uncertainties that may occur in the future and they may generate a loss 
declines in the value of our investment securities may also impact our ability to borrow on margin in the future 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
of the investment properties owned  are currently unencumbered by any indebtedness 
these investment properties are wholly owned by us and are consolidated 
we generally limit our secured indebtedness to approximately of the original purchase price  or current market value if higher  of the investment properties in the aggregate 
these unencumbered investment properties were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  and we believe they would yield at least  in additional cash from financing  using this standard  assuming we are able to borrow using these properties as collateral and with acceptable terms and conditions 
however  our outstanding debt may be limited under our keybank line of credit covenants  which may limit our ability to borrow funds 
in the aggreg ate  all of our investment properties are currently generating sufficient cash flow to pay our operating expenses  debt service requirements and distributions equal to per share on an annual basis 
as of december   the required future principal payments  monthly principal amortization and maturities  on our mortgages payable  line of credit and convertible notes over the next five years and thereafter are as follows a b c thereafter total a included in the debt maturing during is our line of credit with keybank na this line of credit requires compliance with certain covenants  such as debt service ratios  minimum net worth requirements  distribution limitations and investment restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
b approximately  of the company s mortgages payable mature during the company intends to replace these loans with new debt at market terms 
c included in the debt maturing in is our convertible notes issued during  which mature in they are included in because that is the earliest date these notes can be redeemed 
the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities statements of cash flows compared to net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  increased  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in cash was from operations generated by properties acquired during and  subsequent to their acquisitions 
this increase is offset by the payment of larger common area maintenance expenses on our investment properties due primarily to increased snow removal costs incurred during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities increased  as we acquired ten investment properties  of which nine were for our joint venture with irex  during the year ended december  at a cost of  and completed  in additions to our investment properties  as compared to the acquisition of six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  and the completion of  in additions to our investment properties 
additionally  we increased our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures by  primarily for the purchase of vacant land through our development joint ventures and paid approximately  for the purchase of computers and software 
certain payments for computers and software were made to affiliates of the inland group  inc for development and implementation support 
offsetting this increase in cash used is proceeds received during for the sale of our interest in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures  the sale of vacant land parcels through other unconsolidated joint ventures and additional distributions from our unconsolidated joint venture activities 
additionally  we received  from the sale of tenant in common tic interests of properties owned through our joint venture with irex 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  increased  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to net loan proceeds of  and net proceeds from our line of credit of  as compared to net loan proceeds of  and a repayment on our line of credit of  during the year ended december  additionally  we received  more in proceeds from our drp during the year ended december  this increase is offset by proceeds received in for the issuance of our convertible notes

results of operations this section describes and compares our results of operations for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had ownership interests in single user properties  neighborhood centers  community centers  power centers and lifestyle center

offsetting this increase in interest expense is a decrease in interest on our mortgages payable and line of credit due to lower balances outstanding during each year 
interest expense increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due in most part to interest paid on our line of credit with keybank na during the year ended december  this is the result of higher balances maintained throughout the year as well as a higher rate charged on the outstanding balances

the following table presents pertinent information related to these interest rate swap contracts 
notional amount maturity date company s pro rata share total realized loss total unrealized loss february  march  march  non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to ce rtain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
the following table reflects our ffo for the periods presented  reconciled to net income available to common stockholders for these periods for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders gain on sale of investment properties  net of minority interest a equity in depreciation of unconsolidated joint ventures amortization on in place lease intangibles amortization on leasing commissions depreciation  net of minority interest funds from operations net income available to common stockholders per weighted average common share  basic and diluted funds from operations  per weighted average common share  basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted a gains on sale of non operating property are excluded from this adjustment 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization  and gain loss on non operating property 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of c apital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  except for share based payment transactions under sfas r 
we are required to apply the guidance of sfas beginning january  however  in november the effective date of sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinanial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis was deferred for one year

 sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas allows entities to voluntarily choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain non financial instruments that are similar to financial instruments at fair value 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument shall be reported in earnings

apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement the proposed fsp that would require  if ratified  separate accounting for the debt and equity components of convertible instruments 
the proposed fsp would require that the value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value of a similar bond without the conversion feature  which would result in the debt being recorded at a discount 
the debt would subsequently be accreted to its par value over its expected life with a rate of interest being reflected in earnings that reflects the market rate at issuance

sfas is effective for periods beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas inflation our long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   and we had no material derivative instruments 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument will reduce that exposure 
gains or losses related to the derivative financial instrument would be deferred and amortized over the terms of the hedged instrument 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
we will only enter into derivative transactions that satisfy the aforementioned criteria 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans that are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing and or extension due to consideration given to current interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate the table above does not reflect indebtedness incurred after december  our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness  fixed rate debt that matures and needs to be refinanced and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the fair value of debt is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
the fair value of our debt is estimated to be  for debt which bears interest at variable rates and  for debt which bear interest at fixed rates 
we estimate the fair value of our debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by our lenders 
at december   approximately  or  of our debt has variable interest rates averaging 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on debt containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately for the year ended december
