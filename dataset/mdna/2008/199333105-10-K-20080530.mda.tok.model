the solutions segment s gross profit margins increased in fiscal as a result of timing of one large order on an international tire shredder system sale  offsetting losses at our european material handling systems business 
the european systems business losses were the result of performance issues and cost overruns on certain projects  declining sales volumes and an unfavorable mix of projects with regards to resale versus proprietary product componentry

s statutory rates in fiscal a valuation allowance of million existed at march  due to the uncertainty of whether our us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols  deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards might ultimately be realized 
we utilized million of the us federal nols in fiscal reducing the valuation allowance by million 
as a result of our improved operating performance during fiscal  we re evaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining us federal nols and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
as a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that nearly all of the remaining deferred tax assets would be realized  million of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of march  the us nols were fully utilized in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   an increase of million from the march  balance of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal million and improved working capital components million 
changes in net working capital include favorable changes of in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues downsizing of our european material handling systems business and in accounts payable resulting from timing of disbursements and increased volume of business offset by an unfavorable change of million in inventory resulting from support for increase in new product launches and new market penetration and an unfavorable change of million in accrued and non current liabilities funding of pension liabilities 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal million offset by increased working capital components million

these were offset by a favorable change of million on accounts receivables and unbilled revenues as a result of improved collections 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal change in cash used by investing activities is the result of increased capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities offset by proceeds from the sale of properties and assets

the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment  respectively 
we also paid million of financing costs in fiscal to effect the capital transaction previously described 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon a steady economy and successful execution of our current business plan which includes cash generation for debt repayment 
the business plan focuses on continued implementation of lean manufacturing  improving working capital utilization  including inventory management  and new market and new product development 
in march  we entered into a revolving credit facility  which provides availability up to million 
provided there is no default  the company may request an increase in the availability of the revolving credit facility by an amount not exceeding million  subject to lender approval 
the revolving credit facility matures february at march   the revolving credit facility was not drawn and the available amount  net of outstanding letters of credit of million  totaled million 
interest is payable at a eurodollar rate or a prime rate plus an applicable margin determined by our leverage ratio 
at our current leverage ratio  we qualify for the lowest applicable margin level  which amounts to basis points for eurodollar borrowings and zero basis points for prime rate based borrowings 
the revolving credit facility is secured by all us inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the corresponding credit agreement associated with the revolving credit facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including certain financial requirements and a limitation on dividend payments  with which we were in compliance as of march  the senior subordinated notes notes issued on september  amounted to million at march  and are due november  provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
until november   we may redeem up to of the outstanding notes at a redemption price of with the proceeds of equity offerings  subject to certain restrictions 
on or after november   the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from to on and after november  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future us subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
in november  we registered an additional  shares of our common stock which were sold at per share 
the number of shares offered by us was  and  were offered by a selling shareholder 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholder 
this secondary stock offering increased our weighted average common stock outstanding by million shares for the year ended march  unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short term working capital needs for certain of our subsidiaries operating outside of the us the lines of credit are available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction 
as of march   significant credit lines totaled approximately million  of which million was drawn 
in addition to the above facilities  our foreign subsidiaries have certain fixed term bank loans 
as of march   significant secured term loans totaled million 
there were no significant unsecured loans outstanding at march  contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due fiscal fiscal fiscal more than total fiscal fiscal five years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations uncertain tax positions other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e total a as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  improve productivity and customer responsiveness  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
higher capital expenditures in fiscal and were the result of new product development and productivity enhancing equipment along with normal maintenance items 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note has been recorded at its estimated net realizable value of principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly  million of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal  net of tax 
all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of   and as of march   and  respectively  are based on long term bond rates 
the increase in the discount rates for fiscal and resulted in an and decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of march  and  respectively 
the decrease in discount rate for fiscal resulted in a million increase in the projected benefit obligation as of march  the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of for each of the years ended march   and is based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the actual assets realized gains of and million in fiscal and our under funded status as of march  and was million and million  or and of the projected benefit obligation  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately and million  respectively 
the under funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate million  which is down from the fiscal amount of million due to an increase in the return on the higher asset value and lower amortization of unrecognized losses 
the factors outlined above may result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is continued market appreciation in the asset values 
pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to decrease by approximately million compared to fiscal which included approximately million in discretionary contributions above the minimum amounts required by erisa 
the discretionary funding decision reflects an acceleration to comply with the pension protection act of the compensation increase assumption of as of march  and and as of march  is based on historical trends 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal  and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes  we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets as well as goodwill are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we consider market value declines to be other than temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   we had million of gross deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  accrued vacation and incentive costs and also to asset valuation reserves such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves 
the deferred tax assets include million related to various state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider recent earnings projections  allowable tax carryforward periods  tax planning strategies and historical earnings performance to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
changes in these factors could cause us to adjust our valuation allowance  which would impact our income tax expense when we determine that these factors have changed 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer  except for long term construction type contracts 
for long term construction type contracts  we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on an uncompleted contract  a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time it is determined 
billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned  and such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues  respectively 
customers do not routinely return product 
however  sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product 
we have established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends 
effects of new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas to define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no

   and r sfas 
among other items  sfas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity s defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements and requires recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in other comprehensive income 
we adopted all of the currently required provisions of sfas in fiscal this statement also requires an entity to measure a defined benefit postretirement plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year 
this requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this requirement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas 
sfas allows the irrevocable election of fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities and other items on an instrument by instrument basis 
changes in fair value would be reflected in earnings as they occur 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after november  the company believes that the adoption of sfas no

in december  the fasb issued sfas no

consequently such forward looking statements should be regarded as our current plans  estimates and beliefs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  denmark  the united kingdom  france  hungary and germany and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese yuan 
for example  when the us dollar weakens against the euro  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in euros increases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  respectively 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately and million  respectively 
like many industrial manufacturers  we are involved in asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos related liability  we review  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  our recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against us  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions  and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  we have estimated our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
we will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
based on actuarial information  we have estimated our asbestos related aggregate liability through march  and march  to range between million and million using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of to years 
our estimation of our asbestos related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles approximates million which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of march  the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation 
this liability may fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims  which may be influenced by a number of factors  including the outcome of the ongoing broad based settlement negotiations  defensive strategies  and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad based settlement program 
of this amount  management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately million over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on our financial condition or our liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period
