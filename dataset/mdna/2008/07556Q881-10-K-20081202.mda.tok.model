item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview throughout fiscal and  the homebuilding environment continued to deteriorate as consumer confidence declined  the availability of home mortgage credit tightened significantly and the economy continued to slow down 
specifically  the credit markets and the mortgage industry have been experiencing a period of unparalleled turmoil and disruption characterized by bankruptcy  financial institution failure  consolidation and an unprecedented level of intervention by the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  it has made it more difficult for homebuyers to obtain acceptable financing 
in addition  the supply of new and resale homes in the marketplace remained excessive for the levels of consumer demand  further challenged by an increased number of foreclosed homes offered at substantially reduced prices 
these pressures in the marketplace resulted in the use of increased sales incentives and price reductions in an effort to generate sales and reduce inventory levels 
we have responded to this challenging environment with a disciplined approach to the business with continued reductions in direct costs  overhead expenses and land spending 
we have limited our supply of unsold homes under construction and have focused on the generation of cash from our existing inventory supply as we strive to align our land supply and inventory levels to current expectations for home closings 
we have also completed a comprehensive review of each of our markets in order to refine our overall investment strategy and to optimize capital and resource allocations in an effort to enhance our financial position and to increase shareholder value 
this review  which was concluded during the first quarter of fiscal  entailed an evaluation of both external market factors and our position in each market and has resulted in the decision formalized and announced on february   to discontinue homebuilding operations in charlotte  nc  
table of contents cincinnati dayton  oh  columbia  sc  columbus  oh and lexington  ky 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced our decision to discontinue homebuilding operations in colorado and fresno  ca 
we are actively completing an orderly exit from each of these markets and remain committed to our remaining customer care responsibilities 
we have committed to complete all homes under construction in these markets and are in the process of marketing the remaining land positions for sale 
while the underlying basis for exiting each market was different  in each instance we concluded we could better serve shareholder interests by re allocating the capital employed in these markets 
as of september   these markets represented approximately of the company s total assets 
in addition  as disclosed in our form k  the independent investigation  initiated in april by the audit committee of the board of directors the investigation and concluded in may  identified accounting and financial reporting errors and irregularities which resulted in the restatement of certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements 
we have implemented additional internal controls over the selection  application and monitoring of appropriate accounting policies 
see item a controls and procedures for additional information 
the investigation also found evidence that employees of the company s beazer mortgage corporation beazer mortgage subsidiary violated certain federal and or state regulations  including us department of housing and urban development hud regulations 
areas of concern uncovered by the investigation included our former practices in the areas of down payment assistance program  the charging of discount points  the closure of certain hud licenses  closing accommodations  and the payment of a number of realtor bonuses and decorator allowances in certain federal housing administration fha insured loans and non fha conventional loans originated by beazer mortgage dating back to at least the investigation also uncovered limited improper practices in relation to the issuance of a number of non fha stated income loans 
we reviewed the loan documents and supporting documentation and determined that the assets were effectively isolated from the seller and its creditors even in the event of bankruptcy 
based on that information  management continues to believe that sale accounting at the time of the transfer of the loans to third parties was appropriate 
we intend to attempt to negotiate a settlement with prosecutors and regulatory authorities that would allow us to quantify our exposure associated with reimbursement of losses and payment of regulatory and or criminal fines  if they are imposed 
see item legal proceedings for additional discussion of this matter 
at this time  we believe that although it is probable that a liability exists related to this exposure  it is not reasonably estimable and would be inappropriate to record a liability as of september  the housing and economic recovery act of hera was enacted into law on july  among other things  hera provides for a temporary first time home buyer tax credit for purchases made through july   reforms of fannie mae and freddie mac  including adjustments to the conforming loan limits  modernization and expansion of the fha  including an increase to in the minimum down payment required for fha loans  and the elimination of seller funded down payment assistance programs for fha loans approved after september  overall  hera is intended to help stabilize and add consumer confidence to the housing industry 
however  certain of the changes  such as the elimination of the down payment assistance programs and the increase in minimum down payments  may adversely impact the ability of potential homebuyers to afford to purchase a new home or obtain financing 
the down payment assistance programs were utilized for a number of our home closings in fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact hera will have on our business and future results of operations 
the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted into law on october  eesa authorizes up to billion in new spending authority for the united states secretary of the treasury the secretary to purchase  manage and ultimately dispose of troubled assets 
the provisions of this law include an expansion of the hope for homeowners program 
this program allows the secretary to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements so that loans can be modified to prevent foreclosures 
also  the secretary can consent to term extensions  rate reductions and principal write downs 
federal agencies that own mortgage loans are directed to seek modifications prior to foreclosures 
while we expect the impact of this legislation will generally be favorable to the economy  the impact on our operations is not yet determinable 

table of contents outlook we expect that fiscal will pose significant challenges for us 
like many other homebuilders  we have experienced a material reduction in revenues and margins and we incurred significant net losses in fiscal and these net losses were driven primarily by asset impairment and lot option abandonment charges incurred in both fiscal and this has resulted in a decrease in our stockholders equity from billion at september  to million at september  we believe that the homebuilding market will remain challenging throughout fiscal and  as a result  it is likely that we will also incur net losses in  which will further reduce our stockholders equity 
certain of our property specific secured notes payable agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain minimum levels of stockholders equity or some variation  such as tangible net worth or maximum levels of debt to stockholders equity 
although the specific covenants and related definitions vary among the agreements  further reductions in our stockholders equity  absent the receipt of waivers  may cause breaches of some or all of these covenants 
breaches of certain of these covenants  to the extent they lead to an acceleration  may result in cross defaults under our senior notes 
the dollar value of property specific secured notes payable agreements containing stockholders equity related covenants totaled million at september  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any future waivers or amendments that may become necessary without significant additional cost or at all 
in each instance  however  a covenant default can be cured by repayment of the indebtedness 
in addition  the size of our secured revolving credit facility  which has recently been reduced to million  is subject to further reduction to million if our consolidated tangible net worth defined in the agreement as stockholders equity less intangible assets falls below million 
at september  our consolidated tangible net worth for purposes of this covenant was million 
if our consolidated tangible net worth falls below million  we would be in default of the secured revolving credit facility 
under such circumstances  the lenders could terminate the facility  accelerate our obligations thereunder or require us to post cash collateral to support our existing letters of credit 
at september   we had letters of credit outstanding of million under the secured revolving credit facility 
an acceleration of this facility may also result in cross defaults under our senior notes 
decreased levels of stockholders equity may also trigger our obligations to consummate offers to purchase of our non convertible senior notes at par if our consolidated tangible net worth is less than million at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
if triggered and fully subscribed  this could result in our having to purchase million of notes  based on amounts outstanding at september  further  several of our joint ventures are in default under their debt agreements at september  or are at risk of defaulting 
although neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries is the borrower of any of this joint venture debt  we have issued guarantees of various types with respect to many of these joint ventures 
to the extent that we are unable to reach satisfactory resolutions  we may be called upon to perform under our applicable guarantees 
the total dollar value of our repayment and loan to value maintenance guarantees was million at september  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as noted above in item legal proceedings  we are under criminal and civil investigations by the united states attorney s office in the western district of north carolina and other federal and state agencies 
the investigations could result in  among other consequences  the payment of substantial criminal or civil fines or penalties 
as of september   we are not able to estimate the potential magnitude of such potential fines or penalties 
our cash balance at september  was million 
although we expect to incur a net loss during fiscal  we expect to receive a cash tax refund during fiscal of approximately million which  we believe together with our cash as of september   cash generated from our operations during fiscal and availability  if any  under our secured revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal additionally  we may be able to reduce our investment in land and homes to generate further liquidity 
however  if we are required to fund all of the potential obligations associated with lower levels of stockholders equity and joint venture defaults  we would have cash requirements  not including any fines or penalties associated 
table of contents with the government investigations  totaling approximately million which would significantly reduce our overall liquidity 
as a result of these issues  in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
in order to accomplish this goal  we will likely need to issue new common or preferred equity 
any new issuance may take the form of public or private offerings for cash  equity issued to consummate acquisitions of assets or equity issued in exchange for a portion of our outstanding debt 
in addition  we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity or other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms or at all 
we currently intend to attempt to resolve our issues with regulatory authorities before pursuing any specific changes in the capital structure 
critical accounting policies some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
inventory valuation held for development our homebuilding inventories that are accounted for as held for development include land and home construction assets grouped together as communities 
land held for future development is stated at cost 
homebuilding inventories held for development are stated at cost including direct construction costs  capitalized indirect costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes unless facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we assess these assets no less than quarterly for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon the commencement of land development activities  it may take three to five years depending on  among other things  the size of the community and its sales pace to fully develop  sell  construct and close all the homes in a typical community 
the impact of the downturn in our business has significantly lengthened the estimated life of many communities 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated are expected to be less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge should be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
we conduct a review of the recoverability of our homebuilding inventories held for development at the community level as factors indicate that an impairment may exist 
events and circumstances that might indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  adverse trends in new orders  higher than anticipated cancellations  declining margins  which might result from the need to offer incentives to new homebuyers to drive sales or price reductions to respond to actions taken by our competitors  economic factors specific to the markets in which we operate  including fluctuations in employment levels  population growth  or levels of new and resale homes for sale in the marketplace and a decline in the availability of credit across all industries 
as a result  we evaluate  among other things  the following information for each community actual net contribution margin defined as homebuilding revenues less homebuilding costs and direct selling expenses for homes closed in the current fiscal quarter  fiscal year to date and prior two fiscal quarters 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs  
table of contents projected net contribution margin for homes in backlog  actual and trending new orders and cancellation rates  actual and trending base home sales prices and sales incentives for home sales that occurred in the prior two fiscal quarters that remain in backlog at the end of the fiscal quarter and expected future homes sales prices and sales incentives and absorption over the expected remaining life of the community  a comparison of our community to our competition to include  among other things  an analysis of various product offerings including  the size and style of the homes currently offered for sale  community amenity levels  availability of lots in our community and our competition s  desirability and uniqueness of our community and other market factors  and other events that may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of a community that we have evaluated as requiring a test for impairment  significant quantitative and qualitative assumptions are made relative to the future home sales prices  sales incentives  direct and indirect costs of home construction and land development and the pace of new home orders 
in addition  these assumptions are dependent upon the specific market conditions and competitive factors for each specific community and may differ greatly between communities within the same market and communities in different markets 
our estimates are made using information available at the date of the recoverability test  however  as facts and circumstances may change in future reporting periods  our estimates of recoverability are subject to change 
for assets in communities for which the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the carrying value of that community is written down to its then estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows 
the carrying value of assets in communities that were previously impaired and continue to be classified as held for development is not written up for future estimates of increases in fair value in future reporting periods 
market deterioration that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges on previously impaired homebuilding assets in addition to homebuilding assets not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if the market continues to deteriorate 
the fair value of the homebuilding inventory held for development is estimated using the present value of the estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying community assets 
the discount rate used may be different for each community 
the factors considered when determining an appropriate discount rate for a community include  among others community specific factors such as the number of lots in the community  the status of land development in the community  the competitive factors influencing the sales performance of the community and overall market factors such as employment levels  consumer confidence and the existing supply of new and used homes for sale 
the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow models are specific to each community tested for impairment and typically do not include market improvements except in limited circumstances in the latter years of long lived communities 
for the fiscal year ended september   we used discount rates of to in our estimated discounted cash flow impairment calculations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairments of our inventory of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for land under development and homes under construction 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to projected home sales prices and absorption rates  the timing and amount of the estimated future cash flows and discount rates  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and absorption rates require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of inventory held for development that were evaluated for impairment based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management relative to future results 
because our projected cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in market conditions  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ materially from our estimates and result in additional impairments 

table of contents asset valuation land held for sale we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell in accordance with sfas the following criteria are used to determine if land is held for sale management has the authority and commits to a plan to sell the land  the land is available for immediate sale in its present condition  there is an active program to locate a buyer and the plan to sell the property has been initiated  the sale of the land is probable within one year  the property is being actively marketed at a reasonable sale price relative to its current fair value  and it is unlikely that the plan to sell will be withdrawn or that significant changes to the plan will be made 
additionally  in certain circumstances  management will re evaluate the best use of an asset that is currently being accounted for as held for development 
in such instances  management will review  among other things  the current and projected competitive circumstances of the community  including the level of supply of new and used inventory  the level of sales absorptions by us and our competition  the level of sales incentives required and the number of owned lots remaining in the community 
if  based on this review and the foregoing criteria have been met at the end of the applicable reporting period  we believe that the best use of the asset is the sale of all or a portion of the asset in its current condition  then all or portions of the community are accounted for as held for sale 
in determining the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  we considered factors including current sales prices for comparable assets in the area  recent market analysis studies  appraisals  any recent legitimate offers  and listing prices of similar properties 
if the estimated fair value less cost to sell of an asset is less than its current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
during fiscal and  we recorded inventory impairments on land held for sale of approximately million and million  respectively 
no land held for sale inventory impairments were recorded in fiscal due to uncertainties in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in our historical analyses 
our assumptions about land sales prices require significant judgment because the current market is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
we calculated the estimated fair values of land held for sale based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results and may result in additional impairments if market conditions continue to deteriorate 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually as of april or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
each of our operating divisions is considered a reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on expected discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
if goodwill is considered impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds implied fair value of that goodwill 
inherent in our fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including projections of future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
a change in these underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests  which could cause the fair value of one or more reporting units to be less than their respective carrying amounts 
in addition  to the extent that there are significant changes in market conditions or overall economic conditions or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our goodwill has been assigned to reporting units in different geographic locations 
therefore  potential goodwill impairment charges resulting from changes in local market and or local economic conditions or changes in our strategic plans may be isolated to one or a few of our reporting units 
however  our business is concentrated in the 
table of contents homebuilding industry and  as such  a widespread decline in the homebuilding industry or a significant deterioration of economic conditions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of a larger number of our reporting units 
the housing market continued to deteriorate during fiscal and this deterioration has resulted in an oversupply of inventory  reduced levels of demand  increased cancellation rates  aggressive price competition and increased incentives for homes sales 
based on our impairment tests and consideration of the current and expected future market conditions  we determined that goodwill for our reporting units in arizona  colorado  new jersey  southern california and virginia was impaired and recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges totaling million in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our florida  nevada  northern california  north carolina and south carolina reporting units 
while we believe that no additional goodwill impairment existed as of september   future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases  poor performance in either the national economy or individual local economies  or our ability to meet our projections could result in a revised analysis of fair value in the future and lead to impairment of goodwill related to reporting units which are not currently impaired 
as of september   remaining goodwill totaled million 
homebuilding revenues and costs revenue from the sale of a home is generally recognized when the closing has occurred and the risk of ownership is transferred to the buyer 
as appropriate  revenue for condominiums under construction is recognized based on the percentage of completion method in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  when certain criteria are met 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs based upon an allocation of such costs  including costs to complete the development  or specific lot costs  home construction costs including an estimate of costs  if any  to complete home construction  previously capitalized indirect costs principally for construction supervision  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
sales commissions are included in selling  general and administrative expense when the closing has occurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
warranty reserves we currently provide a limited warranty ranging from one to two years covering workmanship and materials per our defined performance quality standards 
in addition  we provide a limited warranty generally ranging from a minimum of five years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose covering only certain defined construction defects 
we also provide a defined structural element warranty with single family homes and townhomes in certain states 
since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors who generally provide us with an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work  claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of our subcontractors 
warranty reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record reserves covering our anticipated warranty expense for each home closed 
management reviews the adequacy of warranty reserves each reporting period  based on historical experience and management s estimate of the costs to remediate the claims  and adjusts these provisions accordingly 
our review includes a quarterly analysis of the historical data and trends in warranty expense by operating segment 
an analysis by operating segment allows us to consider market specific factors such as our warranty experience  the number of home closings  the prices of homes  product mix and other data in estimating our warranty reserves 
in addition  our analysis also contemplates the existence of any non recurring or community specific warranty related matters that might not be contemplated in our historical data and trends 
as a result of our analyses  we adjust our estimated warranty liabilities 
based on historical results  we believe that our existing estimation process is accurate and do not anticipate the process to materially change in the future 
our estimation process for such accruals is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that our warranty reserves at september  are adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs or that future developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we periodically enter into joint ventures with unrelated developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
we have determined that our interest in these joint ventures should be accounted for under the equity method as prescribed by sop  accounting for investments in real estate ventures 
we recognize our share of profits and losses from the sale of lots to other buyers 
our share of profits from lots purchased by beazer homes from the joint ventures are deferred and treated as a reduction of the cost of the land purchased from the joint venture 
such profits are subsequently recognized at the time the home closes and title passes to the homebuyer 
we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other than temporary 
the amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
our assumptions of the joint venture s estimated fair value is dependent on market conditions 
inventory in the joint venture is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities in accordance with sfas if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity in accordance with sfas  our proportionate share of it is reflected in our equity in income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities 
the operating results of the unconsolidated joint ventures are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry  which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates  credit availability  unemployment levels and consumer sentiment 
changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities 
because of these changes in economic conditions  actual results could differ materially from management s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future 
during fiscal and  we wrote down our investment in certain of our joint ventures reflecting million and million  respectively  of impairments of inventory held within those ventures 
these charges are included in equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying statement of operations for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
while we believe that no additional impairment of our joint venture investments existed as of september   market deterioration that exceeds our estimates may lead us to incur additional impairment charges 
as of september   our remaining investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaled million 
income taxes valuation allowance judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we periodically assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the sfas more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  the section limitation on our ability to carryforward pre ownership change net operating losses and recognized built in losses or deductions  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for the valuation of deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible 
table of contents there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance a company may place on projections of future taxable income to support recovery of such deferred tax assets 
in making the determination of whether we are in a cumulative loss position under sfas  we use a measurement period which corresponds to the historical four year business cycle of the homebuilding industry and which mirrors our expected building and profitability cycles 
the homebuilding industry has recently suffered from several temporary factors that have negatively impacted our profitability such as the excess supply of new and used homes for sale and the lack of available credit 
as these factors are resolved it would be expected for the industry to recover to normal profit levels 
however  as we are in a cumulative loss position  as analyzed under sfas  and based on the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  during fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance of million for substantially all of our deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances in the future 
our estimates of the recoverability of deferred tax assets are dependent upon future taxable income which requires significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods carryforward period assumptions  it is reasonably possible that we may be required to record additional valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and such amounts could be material 
in addition  as a result of our ownership change for purposes of section  as of december  our ability to use certain of our pre ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and recognize certain built in losses or deductions is limited by section to a maximum amount of approximately million annually 
based on the resulting limitation  a significant portion of our pre ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and any future recognized built in losses or deductions could expire before we would be able to use them 
our inability to utilize our pre ownership change net operating loss carryforwards or certain built in losses or deductions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
seasonal and quarterly variability our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects escalating new order activity in the second and third fiscal quarters and increased closings in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
however  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal and  we continued to experience challenging conditions in most of our markets which contributed to decreased revenues and closings as compared to prior periods including prior quarters  thereby reducing typical seasonal variations

the continued deterioration of the housing industry contributed to a decrease in revenues from fiscal compared to fiscal homes closed decreased by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as excessive levels of new and resale home supplies  tightening of mortgage credit availability and other economic factors impacted consumer homebuyers 
this decline was especially pronounced in our california  nevada  arizona  new jersey  south carolina and florida markets 
the average sales price of homes closed decreased by to  from  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
average sales price decreased most significantly in our florida  nevada and california markets  due primarily to increased price competition and subsequent price discounting and increasing sales incentives related to the challenging market conditions  including the increased number of foreclosed homes on the market at below average sales prices 
in addition  we had million and million of land sales for the fiscal years ended september  and respectively 
the increase in land sales in fiscal primarily resulted from our sale of two condominium projects in virginia to third parties for approximately million 
gross profit loss 
gross margin for fiscal was compared to a gross margin of for fiscal driven by continued market weakness resulting in lower revenues 
gross margins for both periods were significantly impacted by non cash pre tax inventory impairments and option contract abandonments of million in fiscal compared to million recognized in fiscal gross margins for fiscal continued to be 
table of contents negatively impacted by both higher levels of price discounting and sales incentives as compared to the same period a year ago 
in response to these market conditions and based on our internal analyses and business decisions  we incurred non cash  pretax charges of million for inventory impairments and million for the abandonment of certain land option contracts during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million of inventory impairments and million for the abandonment of land option contracts 
gross profit also includes a reduction in the accrual and costs related to the trinity class action litigation settlement of million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to redeploy assets to more profitable endeavors  we executed several land sales during the past two fiscal years 
we realized a gain on land sales of million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expense during the periods presented is primarily related to cost reductions realized as a result of our comprehensive review and realignment of our overhead structure in light of our reduced volume expectations and lower sales commissions related to decreased revenues  offset by increased costs related to investigation related costs and severance costs 
fiscal and sg a expense included million and million in severance costs related to employees who had been severed as of september of the respective year 
in addition  fiscal and sg a expense included million and million  respectively of investigation related costs an additional million was incurred in fiscal related to and is recorded in our discontinued operations 
as of september   we had reduced our overall number of employees by  or as compared to september   or a cumulative reduction of since september  as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses were in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs and in fiscal excluding the investigation related costs 
the increase in sg a costs as a percentage of total revenue is primarily related to the aforementioned investigative and severance costs and the impact of fixed overhead expenses on reduced revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization d a totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in d a during the periods presented is primarily related to reduced spending on model furnishings and sales office improvements as a result of our strategic review of our communities 
goodwill impairment charges 
in light of continuing market weakness  significantly reduced new orders  additional pricing pressures and additional incentives provided to homebuyers  our reforecasting of expected future results of operations and increasing inventory charges  and in connection with goodwill impairment tests in accordance with sfas  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million in fiscal related to our reporting units in arizona  colorado  new jersey  southern california and virginia 
in fiscal  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to our reporting units in nevada  northern california  florida and certain of our reporting units in south carolina and north carolina 
the goodwill impairment charges were based on estimates of the fair value of the underlying assets of the reporting units 
these charges are reported in corporate and unallocated and are not allocated to our homebuilding segments 
to the extent that there is further deterioration in market conditions or overall economic conditions or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding fair value of reporting units which are currently not impaired could change  which could result in future goodwill impairments that have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
joint venture impairment charges 
as of september   we participated in land development joint ventures in which we had less than a controlling interest 
our joint ventures are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
as a result of the deterioration of the housing market in fiscal  we wrote down our investment in certain of our joint ventures reflecting million of impairments of inventory held within those joint ventures 
joint venture impairments of million and million of contractual obligation abandonments were recorded in fiscal if these adverse market conditions continue or worsen  we may have to take further writedowns of our investments in these joint ventures that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations

our effective tax rate for continuing operations was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rates for fiscal and  respectively  were impacted by million and million of non cash goodwill impairment charges discussed above 
the decrease in our effective tax rate between years is primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal as we are in a cumulative loss position  as analyzed under sfas  and based on the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  during fiscal  we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million for substantially all of our deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we recorded tax benefits related to certain discrete items totaling million in fiscal the principal difference between our effective rate and the us federal statutory rate in fiscal is due to our valuation allowance  state income taxes incurred and certain non deductible goodwill impairment charges million of the million was non tax deductible

the table below summarizes homebuilding revenues and the average selling prices of our homes by reportable segment in thousands homebuilding revenues average selling price change change west east southeast other total homebuilding revenues decreased for the fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal due to decreased closings in the majority of our markets  related to reduced demand  a continued high rate of cancellations  excess capacity in both new and resale markets including increased foreclosures available at lower prices and the mortgage credit tightening as investors continued to divest of prior home purchases and potential homebuyers have difficulty selling their homes and or obtaining financing 
specifically  homebuilding revenues in the west segment decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal due to reduced average sales prices and reduced demand in the majority of the markets in this segment due to deteriorating market conditions and excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets 
in addition  credit tightening in the mortgage markets and a decline in consumer confidence in all of our markets further compounded the market deterioration in our nevada  california  texas and arizona markets in our west segment 
for the fiscal year ended september   our east segment homebuilding revenues decreased by driven by a decline in closings and a decline in average sales prices 
these declines reflect the impact of excess capacity in the resale markets and competitive pricing pressures 
our southeast segment continued to be challenged by significant declines in demand  high cancellations and excess capacity in both the new home and resale markets  driving decreases in homebuilding revenues of for fiscal as compared to fiscal home closings in the southeast segment decreased by from the prior year due to deteriorating market conditions and competitive pressures 
the decrease in closings was driven by higher cancellations  lower demand  higher available supply or new and resale inventory  increased competition and the tightening of credit requirements and decreased availability of mortgage options for potential homebuyers 
homebuilding revenues in our other homebuilding markets decreased in fiscal due to decreased closings of as a result of our strategic decision to exit these markets and optimize our capital and resource allocation in markets better suited to enhance our long term financial position 
as of september   we had homes in backlog related to these communities and  lots held for sale

the increase in corporate and unallocated costs relates primarily to a reduction in capitalized inventory costs due to lower inventories and costs incurred 
corporate and unallocated costs for fiscal include increased amortization of capitalized interest and indirect costs due to a lower capitalizable inventory base and the impairment of capitalized interest and indirect costs in connection with our impairment of inventory held for development

the inventory held for development that was impaired during fiscal represented  lots in communities with an estimated fair value of million 
the impairments recorded on our held for development inventory  for all segments  primarily resulted from the continued significant decline in the homebuilding environment that negatively impacted the sales prices of homes and increased the sales incentives offered to potential homebuyers in our efforts to increase home sales absorptions 
in fiscal  our west and east segments experienced the most significant amount of inventory impairments as compared to our other homebuilding segments due to the fact that the number of owned land and lots in the west and east segments comprise approximately and  respectively  of our total land and lots owned 
table of contents as of september  and approximately and  respectively  of the dollar value of our held for development inventory as of september  in addition  the homebuilding markets that comprise our west segment consist of markets that once experienced the most significant home price appreciation in the nation during the through periods which was driven in large part by speculative purchases and the availability of mortgage credit during those time periods which are significantly less available in the marketplace 
the decline in the availability of mortgage loan products and the exit of speculators from the market  among other factors  contributed to the significant increase in the supply of new and used homes on the market for sale 
the impairments recorded in our other homebuilding segment are primarily as a result of our decision to exit these markets and relate to closing out certain communities and selling off remaining land positions 
we have also recorded million and million of impairments on land during fiscal and  respectively that we have determined does not fit within our homebuilding needs in the current environment and have thus classified as held for sale 
the impairments recorded on our land held for sale  for all segments  primarily resulted from the continued significant decline in the homebuilding environment as discussed above 
the inventory classified as held for sale is primarily located in our west and other segments 
in addition  based on the significant decline in the homebuilding market  we have determined the proper course of action with respect to a number of communities within each homebuilding segment was to abandon the remaining lots under option and to write off the deposits securing the option takedowns  as well as preacquisition costs 
the total abandonments recorded for fiscal were million representing communities  with the southeast and other homebuilding segments representing and  respectively  of fiscal abandonments as we made decisions to abandon certain option contracts that no longer fit in our long term strategic plan and also related to our decision to exit our colorado  charlotte  north carolina  columbia  south carolina  fresno  california and kentucky markets 
fiscal abandonments were million  representing communities and were concentrated in our west and southeast segments  generally among markets with the highest levels of new and resale home supply

table of contents reduced demand compared to the number of new orders received in fiscal for fiscal  we experienced cancellation rates of compared to for fiscal these cancellation rates in both fiscal and reflect the continued challenging market environment which includes the inability of many potential homebuyers to sell their existing homes and obtain affordable financing 
in addition  on july   we completed the sale of two large condominium projects in virginia  which resulted in the cancellation of orders for fiscal  and the significant increase in the cancellation rate for our east segment 
the increase in cancellation rates in our other homebuilding segment primarily relates to our decision to exit all of the markets in this segment and our related decision to curtail production in certain communities and cease production in others 
backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which the company has entered into a sales contract with a customer but has not yet delivered the home 
the aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog at september  of million decreased from million at september   related to a decrease in the number of homes in backlog from  units at september  to  units at september  the decrease in the number of homes in backlog across all of our markets is driven primarily by the aforementioned market weakness and lower new orders 
backlog at september  change west east southeast other total backlog has declined in all of our homebuilding segments due primarily to the significant downturn in our industry  the reduction in the availability of mortgage credit for our potential homebuyers and our decision to sell certain large projects and exit certain markets 
as the availability of mortgage loans declines and the inventory of new and used homes remains at elevated levels  buyers of homes in backlog may have difficulty selling their homes  which generally results in slower new sales absorptions and high cancellation rates 
each cancellation results in a reduction of backlog 
as a result  increased cancellation rates result in reductions to backlog 
continued reduced levels of backlog will produce less revenue in the future which could also result in additional asset impairment charges and lower levels of liquidity 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues 
revenues decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal homes closed decreased by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal driven by the continued deterioration in the majority of our housing markets 
this decline was especially pronounced in our california  nevada  arizona  new jersey  virginia and florida markets 
the average sales price of homes closed decreased by to  from  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
average sales price decreased most significantly in our florida  virginia and southern california markets  due primarily to increased price competition and subsequent price discounting and increasing sales incentives related to the challenging market conditions 
in addition  we had million and million of land sales for the fiscal years ended september  and respectively 
the increase in land sales in fiscal primarily resulted from our continued review of opportunities to minimize underperforming investments and exit a number of less profitable positions  reallocating funds to investments intended to optimize overall returns in the future 
gross profit loss 
gross margin for fiscal was compared to a gross margin of for fiscal  with the decline driven by continued market weakness and non cash pre tax inventory impairments and option contract abandonments of million recognized in fiscal gross margins for fiscal continued to be negatively impacted by both higher levels of price discounting and sales incentives as compared to the same period a year ago 
in response to these market conditions and based on our internal analyses and business decisions  we 
table of contents incurred non cash  pretax charges of million for inventory impairments and million for the abandonment of certain land option contracts during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million of inventory impairments and million for the abandonment of land option contracts 
gross profit also includes a reduction in the accrual and costs related to the trinity class action litigation settlement of million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in an effort to redeploy assets to more profitable endeavors  we executed several land sales during fiscal and we realized a gain of million on land sales in fiscal and a loss of million on land sales in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expense during the periods presented is primarily related to cost reductions realized as a result of our comprehensive review and realignment of our overhead structure in light of our reduced volume expectations and lower sales commissions related to decreased revenues  offset slightly by increased marketing costs related to promotional campaigns 
as of september   we had reduced our overall number of employees by  or as compared to september  fiscal and sg a expense included million and million in severance costs related to employees who had been severed as of september of the respective year 
in addition  fiscal sg a expense included million of investigation related expenses an additional million was related to beazer mortgage and is recorded in our discontinued operations

goodwill impairment charges 
in light of continuing market weakness  impacted by both recent higher levels of price discounting and reduced revenue volume  and in connection with goodwill impairment tests in accordance with sfas  we recorded pretax  non cash goodwill impairment charges of million during the quarter ended june  related to our reporting units in nevada  northern california and tampa  florida 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded additional goodwill impairment charges of million related to certain of our reporting units in south carolina  florida  and north carolina 
the goodwill impairment charges are reported in corporate and unallocated and are not allocated to our homebuilding segments 
to the extent that there is further deterioration in market conditions or overall economic conditions or our strategic plans change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding fair value of reporting units which are currently not impaired could change  which could result in future goodwill impairments that have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
joint venture impairment charges 
as of september   we participated in land development joint ventures in which we had less than a controlling interest 
our joint ventures are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
as a result of the deterioration of the housing market in fiscal  we wrote down our investment in certain of our joint ventures reflecting million of impairments of inventory held within those joint ventures and million of contractual obligation abandonments 
if these adverse market conditions continue or worsen  we may have to take further writedowns of our investments in these joint ventures 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate for was impacted by the million non cash goodwill impairment charge discussed above 
the decrease in our effective tax rate between years is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charges million of which is non tax deductible  changes in income concentrations in the various states  the timing of certain state tax initiatives and the expiration of statute of limitations for certain tax contingencies 
as a result  we recorded tax benefits related to certain discrete items totaling million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we recognized a million tax benefit related to new provisions under the

in addition  credit tightening in the mortgage markets and a decline in consumer confidence in all of our markets further compounded the market deterioration in our nevada  california and arizona markets 
the year over year change in homebuilding revenues in the east segment reflects the impact of decreased closings driven by excess capacity in the resale markets as investors continued to divest of prior home purchases and potential homebuyers continue to experience difficulty selling their existing homes 
the decrease in closings was offset slightly by an increased average selling price related to a change in product mix and closing concentrations across our eastern markets

table of contents home sales absorptions 
the west segment experienced the most significant amount of inventory impairments as compared to our other homebuilding segments due to the fact that the number of owned land and lots in the west segment comprises approximately of our total land and lots owned as of september  and the value of the inventory held for development in the west segment represents approximately of the dollar value our land held for development inventory as of september  in addition  our homebuilding markets that comprise our west segment consist of markets that once experienced the most significant home price appreciation in the nation during the through periods which was driven in large part by speculative purchases and the availability of mortgage credit during those time periods which are no longer present in the marketplace 
the decline in the availability of mortgage loan products and the exit of speculators from the market  among other factors  contributed to the significant increase in the supply of new and used homes on the market for sale 
the impairments recorded in our other homebuilding segments are primarily as a result of continued price competition brought on by the significant increase in new and resale home inventory during fiscal that has resulted in increased sales incentives and home sales price declines as we attempt to increase new orders and generate cash to the company 
we have also recorded million in impairments on land inventory during fiscal that we have determined does not fit within our homebuilding needs in the current environment and have thus classified as held for sale 
the impairments recorded on our land held for sale  for all segments  primarily resulted from the continued significant decline in the homebuilding environment as discussed above 
the inventory classified as land held for sale as of september  is primarily located in our west segment representing nine communities and approximately lots 
in addition  we have also completed a strategic review of all of the markets within our homebuilding segments and the communities within each of those markets with an initial focus on the communities for which land has been secured with option purchase contracts 
as a result of this review  we have determined the proper course of action with respect to a number of communities within each homebuilding segment was to abandon the remaining lots under option and to write off the deposits securing the option takedowns  as well as preacquisition costs 
the total abandonments recorded for fiscal were million which represented communities

new orders  net of cancellations  decreased to  or during fiscal compared to  during fiscal as new orders decreased across most of our markets 
the decrease was due primarily to lower levels of demand for new homes  an increase in resale home inventory  a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers and significant increases in cancellation rates due partially to a decline in homebuyer confidence in the homebuilding market 
specifically  cancellation rates increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this higher cancellation rate in fiscal also reflects the challenging market environment including the inability of many potential homebuyers to sell their existing homes  the increased price competition and incentives offered and the tightening of credit markets 
the number of homes in backlog decreased from september  to september  driving a decrease in the aggregate dollar value of homes in backlog from billion at september  to million at september  the decrease in aggregate dollar value also reflects a decline in the average price of homes in backlog from  at september  to  at september  this decrease in average sale price was most pronounced in the markets in our west and southeast segments

we generated million in cash during fiscal through a combination of our homebuilding operational activities  the sale of non core assets in all of our markets  including the markets which we are exiting  and from a significant reduction in fixed costs  land acquisition and land development spending 
in addition  we paid off million of our secured notes payable during fiscal our liquidity position consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents as of september  our increase in cash as of september  as compared to cash of million at september   was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities of million relating primarily to the significant

based on the applicable year s closings  as of september   our land bank includes a year supply of owned and optioned land lots for current and future development 
the years supply in land bank declined as of september  when compared to september  primarily due to the decrease in the number of lots in the ending land bank as of september  as compared to september  as the homebuilding market declined  we were successful in significantly reducing our land bank through the abandonment of lot option contracts  the sale of land assets not required in our homebuilding program and through the sale of new homes with only years of owned land and lots as of september  the decrease in the number of owned lots in our land bank from september  to september  related to our decision to eliminate non strategic positions to align our land supply with our expectations for future home closings 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for the comparable period of fiscal  as we invested less in unconsolidated joint ventures and capital expenditures for model and sales office improvements as part of our strategic efforts to control spending in light of the current market conditions

in response to the reduced size of our homebuilding operations  which resulted from the deterioration in the homebuilding market  our projected future liquidity requirements and anticipated covenant breaches  we agreed to reduce our secured revolving credit facility during fiscal from million at september  to a maximum of million  subject to additional reductions as more fully described below 
our facility is collateralized with real estate assets used in our homebuilding operations and is subject to a borrowing base calculation which limits the availability under the facility 
as the homebuilding markets have contracted  we have continued to decrease the size of our business through a reduction in personnel and additional non core markets  such as colorado and fresno  california during fiscal we have continued our focus on cash generation and preservation to ensure we have the required liquidity to fund our operations as we build availability under our secured revolving credit facility 
we fulfill our short term cash requirements with cash generated from our operations and funds available from our secured revolving credit facility 
there were no amounts outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility at september  or september   however  we had million and million of letters of credit outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility at september  and september   respectively 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents at september  of million  the receipt of our income tax refund of approximately million  which we expect to receive in the first half of fiscal  cash generated from our operations and availability  if any  under our secured revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during fiscal however  if we are required to fund all of the potential obligations associated with lower levels of stockholders equity and joint venture defaults  as more fully discussed below  we would have cash requirements  not including any fines or penalties associated with the government investigations  totaling approximately million which would significantly reduce our overall liquidity 
as a result of these issues  in addition to our continued focus on generation and preservation of cash  we are also focused on increasing our stockholders equity and reducing our leverage 
in order to accomplish this goal  we will likely need to issue new common or preferred equity 
any new issuance may take the form of public or private offerings for cash  equity issued to consummate acquisitions of assets or equity issued in exchange for a portion of our outstanding debt 
we may also from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity or other debt securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in addition  any material variance from our projected operating results or land investments  or investments in or acquisitions of businesses  payment of regulatory and or criminal fines or our 
table of contents inability to increase our availability under our secured revolving credit facility  as described in more detail below  could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
any such equity transactions or debt financing may be on terms less favorable or at higher costs than our current financing sources  depending on future market conditions and other factors including any possible downgrades in our credit ratings or adverse commentaries issued by rating agencies in the future 
also  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any of these transactions on favorable terms or at all

further  the facility size is subject to reduction to million if our interest coverage ratio for the quarter ending june  is less than x 
we expect that fiscal will pose significant challenges for us 
like many other homebuilders  we have experienced a material reduction in revenues and margins and we incurred significant net losses in fiscal and these net losses were driven primarily by asset impairment and lot option abandonment charges incurred in both fiscal and this has resulted in a decrease in our stockholders equity from billion at september  to million at september  we believe that the homebuilding market will remain challenging throughout fiscal and  as a result  it is likely that we will also incur net losses in  which will further reduce our stockholders equity and consolidated tangible net worth 
if our consolidated tangible net worth falls below million  we would be in default of the secured revolving credit facility 
under such circumstances  the lenders could terminate the facility  accelerate our obligations thereunder or require us to post cash collateral to support our existing letters of credit 
at september   we had letters of credit outstanding of million under the secured revolving credit facility 
availability under the facility continues to be subject to satisfaction of a secured borrowing base 
the amendment provided that the book value of the assets securing the facility must exceed x the outstanding loans and letters of credit 
such coverage level increases to x and x to the extent the facility size is reduced to million or million  respectively 
as of september   and prior to the submittal of fiscal financial reports  we were in compliance with the collateral coverage requirements  but had no additional availability 
concurrent with the filing of our fiscal financial reports  our facility size will decrease to million and our collateral coverage level will increase to x the amount of outstanding loans and letters of credit 
as a result of the increase in collateral coverage to x we will be required to provide a total of million in cash to fully collateralize our outstanding letters of credit 
we intend to add approximately million of additional real estate assets to the borrowing base over the next twelve months  which will provide up to million in additional borrowing base availability after providing for the return of the million in restricted cash 
assets in the borrowing base  and therefore any further availability  are subject to required appraisals and other bank review procedures 
the availability under our facility is not impacted by any actions of the respective credit rating agencies 
the value of the real estate assets securing our borrowing base could decline should the downturn in our industry worsen 
any reduction in value could result in a reduction in available borrowing capacity under the secured revolving credit facility 
the interest margins under the secured revolving credit facility were increased and are now based on the facility size 
following the amendment  the eurodollar margin under the facility was set at 
to the extent the facility size is reduced to million or million  the eurodollar margin will increase to and  respectively 
as a result of the reduction in facility size to million  the current eurodollar margin is now 
the financial maintenance covenants pertaining to the leverage ratio  interest coverage ratio and land inventory were eliminated as part of the august amendment 
the remaining financial maintenance covenants are a minimum tangible net worth covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant 
the minimum liquidity covenant  which is applicable for so long as our interest coverage ratio is less than x  requires us to maintain either a million of unrestricted cash and borrowing base availability or b a ratio the adjusted coverage ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations defined as cash flow from operations plus interest incurred to interest incurred of at least

the following table sets forth our financial covenant requirements under our secured revolving credit facility and our compliance with such covenants as of september  financial covenant covenant requirement actual consolidated tangible net worth million million minimum liquidity million of unrestricted cash and borrowing base availability or adjusted coverage ratio x million of unrestricted cash and borrowing base availability and adjusted coverage ratio of x we believe that the elimination and relaxation of the financial maintenance covenants will permit us to comply with the amended covenants for the foreseeable future 
however  further deteriorations in the housing market generally  or in our business particularly  could result in additional inventory impairments or operational losses which could also result in our having to seek additional amendments or waivers under the secured revolving credit facility 
to the extent that we default under any of these covenants and we are unable to obtain waivers  the lenders under the secured revolving credit facility could accelerate our obligations thereunder 
any such acceleration may result in an event of default under our senior notes described below and would permit the holders thereof to accelerate our obligations under the senior notes 
senior notes the senior notes are unsecured obligations ranking pari passu with all other existing and future senior indebtedness 
substantially all of our significant subsidiaries are full and unconditional guarantors of the senior notes and are jointly and severally liable for obligations under the senior notes and the secured revolving credit facility 
each guarantor subsidiary is a owned subsidiary of beazer homes 
the indentures under which the senior notes were issued contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on payment of dividends 
at september   under the most restrictive covenants of each indenture  no portion of our retained earnings was available for cash dividends or for share repurchases 
the indentures provide that  in the event of defined changes in control or if our consolidated tangible net worth falls below a specified level or in certain circumstances upon a sale of assets  we are required to offer to repurchase certain specified amounts of outstanding senior notes 
specifically  each indenture other than the indenture governing the convertible senior notes requires us to offer to purchase of each series of senior notes at par if our consolidated tangible net worth defined as stockholders equity less intangible assets is less than million at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters 
if triggered and fully subscribed  this could result in our having to purchase million of notes  based on amounts outstanding at september  in march  we voluntarily repurchased million of our outstanding senior notes and million of our outstanding senior notes on the open market 
the aggregate purchase price was million  or an average of of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
the repurchase of the notes resulted in a  pretax loss during the second quarter of fiscal on march   we repurchased an additional million of our outstanding senior notes which were cash settled on april  at a purchase price of million  or an average of of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the purchase date 
the repurchase of the notes resulted in a  pre tax gain during the third quarter of fiscal gains losses from notes repurchased are included in other expense income  net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations 
senior notes purchased by the company were cancelled 
on october   we obtained consents from holders of our senior notes to approve amendments of the indentures under which the senior notes were issued 
these amendments restrict our ability to secure additional debt in excess of million until certain conditions are met and enable us to invest up to million in joint ventures 
the consents also provided us with a waiver of any and all defaults under the senior notes that may have occurred on or prior to may  relating to filing or delivering annual and quarterly financial statements 
fees and expenses related to obtaining these consents totaled approximately million 
the recording of such fees and expenses has been deferred and will be amortized as an adjustment to interest expense in accordance with eitf debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 

table of contents junior subordinated notes on june   we completed a private placement of million of unsecured junior subordinated notes which mature on july  and are redeemable at par on or after july  and pay a fixed rate of for the first ten years ending july  thereafter  the securities have a floating interest rate equal to three month libor plus per annum  resetting quarterly 
these notes were issued to beazer capital trust i  which simultaneously issued  in a private transaction  trust preferred securities and common securities with an aggregate value of million to fund its purchase of these notes 
the transaction is treated as debt in accordance with gaap 
the obligations relating to these notes and the related securities are subordinated to the secured revolving credit facility and the senior notes 
on april   we received a default notice from the bank of new york trust company  national association  the trustee under the indenture governing these junior subordinated notes 
the notice alleged that we were in default under the indenture because we had not yet furnished certain required information including our annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements 
the notice further alleged that this default would become an event of default under the indenture if not remedied within days 
the company subsequently delivered the information that was subject to the default notice thereby curing any alleged default that may have occurred 
other secured notes payable we periodically acquire land through the issuance of notes payable 
as of september  and september   we had outstanding notes payable of million and million  respectively  primarily related to land acquisitions 
these notes payable expire at various times through and had fixed and variable rates ranging from to at september  these notes are secured by the real estate to which they relate 
during fiscal  we repaid million of these secured notes payable 
in connection with the sale of our interest in two joint ventures to our joint venture partner  we also acquired that partner s interest in two separate joint ventures 
in connection with the acquisition of one of these ventures  we assumed the joint venture s debt of approximately million which is included in other secured notes payable as of september  the agreements governing these secured notes payable contain various affirmative and negative covenants 
certain of these secured notes payable agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain minimum levels of stockholders equity or some variation  such as tangible net worth or maximum levels of debt to stockholders equity 
although the specific covenants and related definitions vary among the agreements  further reductions in our stockholders equity  absent the receipt of waivers  may cause breaches of some or all of these covenants 
breaches of certain of these covenants  to the extent they lead to an acceleration  may result in cross defaults under our senior notes 
the dollar value of these secured notes payable agreements containing stockholders equity related covenants totaled million at september  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any future waivers or amendments that may become necessary without significant additional cost or at all 
in each instance  however  a covenant default can be cured by repayment of the indebtedness 
model home financing obligations due to a continuing interest in certain model home sale leaseback transactions  we have recorded million and million of debt as of september  and september   respectively  related to these financing transactions in accordance with sfas as amended  accounting for leases 
these model home transactions incur interest at a variable rate of one month libor plus basis points  as of september   and expire at various times through stock repurchases and dividends paid on november   as part of an acceleration of beazer homes comprehensive plan to enhance stockholder value  our board of directors authorized an increase in our stock repurchase plan to ten million shares of our common stock 
the plan provides that shares may be purchased for cash in the open market  on the nyse  or in privately negotiated transactions 
we did not repurchase any shares in the open market during fiscal and at september   there are approximately million additional shares available for purchase pursuant to the plan 
however  in december  we suspended our repurchase program and any resumption of such program will be at the discretion of the board of directors and as allowed by our debt covenants and is unlikely in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on share repurchases and the payment of dividends 
at september   under the most restrictive covenants of each indenture  none of our retained earnings was available for cash dividends or share repurchases 

table of contents for fiscal  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per common share  or a total of approximately million 
for fiscal  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per common share  or a total of approximately million 
on november   our board of directors suspended our dividend payments 
the board concluded that suspending dividends  which will allow us to conserve approximately million of cash annually  was a prudent effort in light of the continued deterioration of the housing market 
we did not pay any dividends in fiscal in addition  during fiscal  and fiscal   shares   shares and  shares  respectively  were surrendered to us by employees in payment of minimum tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units under our stock incentive plans 
we valued the stock at the market price on the date of surrender  for an aggregate value of approximately  or approximately per share for fiscal   or approximately per share  for fiscal and million  or approximately per share  for fiscal off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual commitments 
at september   we controlled  lots a year supply based on fiscal closings 
we owned  or  lots  and  lots   were under option contracts which generally require the payment of cash or the posting of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a certain price 
we historically have attempted to control a portion of our land supply through options 
as a result of the flexibility that these options provide us  upon a change in market conditions we may renegotiate the terms of the options prior to exercise or terminate the agreement 
under option contracts  both with and without specific performance provisions  purchase of the properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers 
our obligation with respect to options with specific performance provisions is included in our consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities 
under option contracts without specific performance obligations  our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the non refundable deposits  letters of credit and other non refundable amounts incurred  which aggregated approximately million at september  this amount includes non refundable letters of credit of approximately million 
the total remaining purchase price  net of cash deposits  committed under all options was million as of september  only million of the total remaining purchase price contains specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations 
we expect to exercise substantially all of our remaining option contracts with specific performance obligations and  subject to market conditions  most of our option contracts without specific performance obligations 
various factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as market conditions  weather conditions and the timing of the completion of development activities  will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether land options will be exercised 
we have historically funded the exercise of land options through a combination of operating cash flows and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect these sources to continue to be adequate to fund anticipated future option exercises 
therefore  we do not anticipate that the exercise of our land options will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
certain of our option contracts are with sellers who are deemed to be variable interest entities vies under fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts 
our risk is generally limited to the option deposits that we pay  and creditors of the sellers generally have no recourse to the general credit of the company 
although we do not have legal title to the optioned land  for those option contracts for which we are the primary beneficiary  we are required to consolidate the land under option at fair value 
we believe that the exercise prices of our option contracts approximate their fair value 
our consolidated balance sheets at september  and reflect consolidated inventory not owned of million and million  respectively 
we consolidated million and million of lot option agreements as consolidated inventory not owned pursuant to fin r as of september  and september   respectively 
in addition  as of september  and september   we recorded million and million  respectively  of land under the caption consolidated inventory not owned related to lot option agreements in accordance with sfas  product financing arrangements 
obligations related to consolidated inventory not owned totaled million at september  and million at september  the difference between the balances of consolidated inventory not owned and obligations related to consolidated inventory not owned represents cash deposits paid under the option agreements 

table of contents we participate in a number of land development joint ventures in which we have less than a controlling interest 
we enter into joint ventures in order to acquire attractive land positions  to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base 
our joint ventures are typically entered into with developers  other homebuilders and financial partners to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture s members and other third parties 
we account for our interest in these joint ventures under the equity method 
our consolidated balance sheets include investments in joint ventures totaling million and million at september  and  respectively 
our joint ventures typically obtain secured acquisition and development financing

generally  we and our joint venture partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
at september   we had repayment guarantees of million and loan to value maintenance guarantees of million of debt of unconsolidated joint ventures 
several of our joint ventures are in default under their debt agreements at september  or are at risk of defaulting 
to the extent that we are unable to reach satisfactory resolutions  we may be called upon to perform under our applicable guarantees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that our exposure in this area is material to cash flows or earnings 
as of september   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
based on our fiscal average outstanding borrowings under our variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would negatively impact our annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at september  was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion  due primarily to increases in our estimated discount rates for similar financial instruments 
in addition  the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in our estimated discount rates would increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from billion to billion at september
