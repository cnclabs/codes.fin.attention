table of contents all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  legal  environmental  and upkeep costs associated with non operating facilities  other peripheral businesses  and the change in market valuation related to ineffective commodity hedges 
foreign operations 
trinity s foreign operations are primarily located in mexico 
continuing operations included sales to foreign customers  primarily in mexico  which represented   and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december    and  we had approximately   and of our long lived assets not held for sale located outside the united states 
we manufacture railcars  propane tank containers  tank heads  structural wind towers  and other parts at our mexico facilities for export to the united states and other countries 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and its agencies or on exports imposed by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations  and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of these factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was approximately billion  approximately million for inland barge products  and approximately million for structural wind towers 
included in the railcar backlog was approximately  million of railcars to be sold to our leasing group of which have lease agreements for these railcars with external customers 
a majority of our backlog is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  in  the inland barge group entered into a multi year sales agreement for dry cargo barges with deliveries beginning in deliveries for are included in the backlog at this time  deliveries beyond are not included in the backlog as specific production quantities for future years have not been determined 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was approximately billion  million for inland barge products  and million for structural wind towers 
included in the railcar backlog was  million of railcars to be sold to our leasing group 
marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in the following states and foreign countries arkansas  california  connecticut  florida  georgia  illinois  kentucky  louisiana  minnesota  missouri  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  south dakota  tennessee  texas  utah  washington  canada  mexico  and sweden 
we also use independent sales representatives to a limited extent 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar specialty components and steel 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel  as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  axles  side frames  bolsters  and bearings 
specialty components and steel purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least two suppliers continue to produce most components 
however  any unanticipated interruption in the supply chain of specialty components would have an impact on both our margins and production schedules 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel we purchased increased at a much lower rate than in prior years and general price increases announced by the steel producers were mitigated through contract purchases 
steel prices have been and may be volatile as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel production facilities 
supply was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
the prices for component parts purchased in increased over base prices paid in we used escalation clauses and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of these cost increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 

table of contents in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe the existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the united states  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
cement 
cement required for the concrete aggregates business is received primarily from texas and overseas 
in  the supply of cement was sufficient in our markets to meet demand 
we have not experienced difficulties supplying concrete to our customers 
employees 
the following table presents the approximate breakdown of employees by business group december  business group rail group construction products group inland barge group energy equipment group railcar leasing and management services group all other corporate as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the united states and approximately  employees were employed in mexico 
acquisitions and divestitures

environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  and other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any non compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 

table of contents in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill  or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill  or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation 
railcar industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the united states department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the united states department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars and railcar parts  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether any future changes in these rules and regulations could cause added compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
inland barge industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the united states coast guard  the united states national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents  and recommend safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
highway products 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of our highway products business are the united states department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found not to be in compliance with these standards and specifications we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
we believe that our highway products are in substantial compliance with all applicable standards and specifications 
we cannot predict whether future changes in these standards and specifications  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations 
our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and our operations may be adversely affected by the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 

table of contents other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

risk factors 
there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements  and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial but that which may become material in the future also may impair our business operations 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein 
we undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could result in lower sales volumes  lower prices  and or a loss of profits 
the railcar  barge  and wind energy industries have previously experienced deep down cycles and operated with a minimal backlog 
if a down cycle were to return in one or more of these cyclical businesses  we could experience losses and close plants  suspend production  and incur related costs 
litigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we and our subsidiaries are currently  and may from time to time be  involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims could result in significant monetary damages against us that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
while we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability and liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries  our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of claims or lawsuits or any future claims or lawsuits arising from our businesses for which we are judged liable  and any such claims or lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
increases in the price and demand for steel and other component parts could lower our margins and profitability 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel we purchased increased at a much lower rate than in prior years and general price increases announced by the steel producers were partially mitigated through contract purchases 
steel prices have been and may be volatile as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel production facilities 
supply was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
the prices for component parts purchased in increased over base prices paid in we used escalation clauses and other arrangements with our customers to reduce the impact of these cost increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have developed will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 

table of contents we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with air quality and the handling and disposal of waste products  fuel products  and hazardous substances 
in particular  we may incur investigation  remediation  and related expenses related to property conditions that we inherited after acquiring older manufacturing facilities that were constructed and operated before the adoption of current environmental laws 
further  some of the products we manufacture are used to transport hazardous materials 
although we conduct due diligence inquiries and analysis with respect to environmental matters in connection with acquisitions  we may be unable to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
environmental liabilities incurred by us  if not covered by adequate insurance or indemnification  will increase our respective costs and have a negative impact on our profitability 
we operate in highly competitive industries  which may impact our financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
as a result  competition on pricing is often intense 
the effect of this competition could reduce our revenues  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 
if our railcar leasing subsidiary is unable to obtain acceptable long term financing of its railcar lease fleet  our lenders may foreclose on the portion of our lease fleet that secures our warehouse facility 
tilc  our wholly owned captive leasing subsidiary  uses borrowings under a warehouse facility to initially finance the railcars it purchases from our rail manufacturing business 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are secured by the specific railcars financed by such borrowings and the underlying leases 
the warehouse facility is non recourse to us and to our subsidiaries other than trinity rail leasing trust ii trl ii a qualified subsidiary of tilc that is the borrower under the warehouse facility 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are available through august  and unless renewed would be payable in three equal installments in february  august  and february a decline in the value of the railcars securing borrowings under the warehouse facility or in the creditworthiness of the lessees under the associated leases could reduce trl ii s ability to obtain long term financing for such railcars 
additionally  fluctuations in interest rates from the time trl ii purchases railcars with short term borrowings under the warehouse facility and the time trl ii obtains permanent financing for such railcars could decrease our profitability on the leasing of the railcars and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if trl ii is unable to obtain long term financing to replace borrowings under the warehouse facility  trinity may decide to satisfy trl ii s indebtedness under the warehouse facility or the lenders under the warehouse facility may foreclose on the portion of trl ii s lease fleet pledged to secure this facility 
as of december   there was million of indebtedness outstanding and million was available under the warehouse facility 
in february  this facility was increased to million with the availability period of the facility remaining through august we may be unable to re market leased railcars on favorable terms  which could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms 
our ability to re lease or sell leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for newer or specific use models  the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  the degree of obsolescence of leased railcars  the prevailing market and economic conditions  including interest and inflation rates  the need for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  and the volume of railcar traffic 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re market risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms  requiring us to re market 
table of contents leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
tilc s reserve for credit losses may prove inadequate 
our reserve for possible credit losses is maintained based upon management s judgment of losses  history  and risks inherent in the railcar lease portfolio 
we periodically review our reserve for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends  and collateral values  car type concentration risk including our ability to re market railcars  utilization levels of the lease fleet  market conditions of various industries  credit quality indicators  including external credit reports  past charge off experiences and levels of past due receivables 
we cannot be certain that our reserve for credit losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries or markets 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates  our reserves may be inadequate to cover credit losses  and any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
fluctuations in the supply of component parts used in the production of our railcar related and structural wind tower products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
a significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  side frames  bolsters  bearings  and flanges at competitive prices 
we depend on third party suppliers for a significant portion of our component part needs 
specialty components comprise a significant portion of the production cost of each railcar we manufacture 
due to consolidations and challenging industry conditions  the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  though generally a minimum of two suppliers continue to produce each type of component we use in our products 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  a significant decrease in the availability of specialty components could materially increase our cost of goods sold or prevent us from manufacturing our products on a timely basis 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs 
we use natural gas at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment 
over the past three years  prices for natural gas have fluctuated significantly 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power and  in particular  a prolonged armed conflict in the middle east  could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general 
hurricanes or other natural disasters could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
our manufacturer s warranties expose us to potentially significant claims 
depending on the product  we warrant against manufacturing defects due to our workmanship and certain materials pursuant to express limited contractual warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our mass production process or claims for which the cost of repairing or replacing the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs  and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage  and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous  toxic or volatile materials 
we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims within our self insured retention increases  we could suffer costs in excess of our reserves 
an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass 
table of contents production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the united states could decrease our profitability 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade  or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar design and railcar component part design  performance  and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences  and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and agencies  or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies  could affect our ability to export products that we manufacture in mexico 
because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have employment agreements with us 
although we have historically been successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may not be able to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts  and other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials or component parts 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs 
violations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the united states environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the united states department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the united states department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and the further adoption of occupational 
table of contents health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation  investigations  or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation  investigations  or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
we may be required to reduce our inventory carrying values  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
to support our production line continuity  we ended with a higher level of railcars in our finished goods inventory than in  due to our decision to build railcars in anticipation of demand from tilc and external customers  including trip 
we expect to sell this inventory in the normal course of business 
we are required to record all our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments in respect to demand requirements and compare those with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have historically recorded reductions in inventory carrying values when product lines are discontinued or market conditions change as a result of changes in demand requirements 
we may be required to reduce inventory carrying values in the future due to a severe decline in market conditions  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would weaken our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate for potential impairment the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced commensurate with the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we seek to minimize these risks  when considered appropriate  through the use of currency and interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures may not be implemented or effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us

at the time a derivative contract is entered into  and at least quarterly thereafter  the company assesses whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows 
any change in fair value resulting in ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  is recognized in current period earnings 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl as a separate component of stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings

see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  insurance  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory we state all our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires the inventory to be analyzed at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and to record any required adjustments 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced by the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
goodwill we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue related to products covered by warranties assumed 
we base our estimates on historical warranty claims 
we also provide for specifically identified warranty obligations 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
insurance we are effectively self insured for workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator processes all such claims 
we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies 
to the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates  our liability may change 

table of contents contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note commitments and contingencies  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or judgment costs for the resolution of certain of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
environmental we are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings  taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification 
however  estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us

forward looking statements this annual report on form k or statements otherwise made by the company or on the company s behalf from time to time in other reports  filings with the sec  news releases  conferences  world wide web postings or otherwise contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of any statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  future financial performances  estimates  projections  goals  and forecasts 
trinity uses the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  forecasts  may  will  should  and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements 
potential factors  which could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  include among others market conditions and demand for our products  the cyclical nature of both the railcar and barge industries  continued expansion of the structural wind towers business  variations in weather in areas where construction products are sold and used  disruption of manufacturing capacity due to weather related events  the timing of introduction of new products  the timing of customer orders  product pricing changes  changes in mix of products sold  the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  availability and costs of component parts  supplies  and raw materials  competition and other competitive factors  changing technologies  steel prices

trinity undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings could be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of our total debt as of december  if interest rates average one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during  and our debt level remained constant  our interest expense would increase by million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if interest rates averaged one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the year ended december   our interest expense would increase by million 
a one percentage point change in the interest rate would increase decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates and scheduled principal payments on our variable rate debt obligations as of december  and trinity uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of increases in natural gas  diesel fuel prices  and zinc 
existing hedge transactions as of december  are based on the new york mercantile exchange for natural gas and heating oil 
hedge transactions are settled with the counterparty in cash 
at december  we had recorded in the consolidated balance sheet an asset of million  and at december  we had recorded in the consolidated balance sheet a liability of million 
the effect on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  was income of million  and for the year ended december  was expense of million 
the following table is an estimate of the impact to earnings that could result from hypothetical price changes during the year ending december  and the balance sheet impact from the hypothetical price change  both based on hedge positions at december  sensitivity analysis hedge commodity price change annual pre tax impact balance sheet impact in millions percent increase increase in income increase in asset percent decrease decrease in income decrease in asset in addition  we are subject to market risk related to our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries as of december  is million 
the impact of such market risk exposures as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been material to us
