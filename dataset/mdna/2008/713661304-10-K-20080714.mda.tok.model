item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe the company s financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and hepatitis c virus hcv infection 
we are advancing three separate clinical programs with our first in class compounds bavituximab and cotara that employ our two platform technologies anti phosphatidylserine anti ps therapeutics and tumor necrosis therapy tnt 
our lead anti ps product  bavituximab  is being evaluated under two separate clinical programs for the treatment of solid cancers and hepatitis c virus hcv infection 
under our tnt technology platform  our lead candidate cotara  is advancing through two clinical studies for the treatment of patients with brain cancer 
we are organized into two reportable operating segments i peregrine  the parent company  is engaged in the research and development of monoclonal antibody products for the treatment of cancer and viral infections and ii avid bioservices  inc  avid a wholly owned subsidiary  is engaged in providing contract manufacturing services for peregrine and outside customers on a fee for services basis 
going concern the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
at april   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on i the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and ii funding the operations of our wholly owned subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue in fiscal year therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
we will need additional capital to support the costs of our clinical and pre clinical programs through one or more methods including either equity or debt financing 
as of april   we had an aggregate of approximately  shares available under our existing effective form s registration statements for possible future registered transactions 
in addition  we filed a separate shelf registration statement on form s  file number  under which we may issue  from time to time  in one or more offerings  shares of our common stock for remaining gross proceeds of up to  we may also raise additional capital though negotiating licensing or collaboration agreements for our technology platforms 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiary avid bioservices  inc  represents an additional asset in our portfolio and we are actively pursuing strategic initiatives for avid as a means of raising additional capital 
although we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements or from a potential strategic transaction related to our subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which includes projected revenues from existing customers of avid bioservices  inc  combined with the projected revenues from our government contract  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers and from our government contract to meet our obligations as they become due through at least fiscal year there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of contracts and technical challenges  which would reduce or delay our future projected cash inflows 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change in thousands in thousands revenues contract manufacturing license revenue total revenues cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total cost and expenses loss from operations other income expense recovery of note receivable interest and other income interest and other expense net loss total revenues year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in revenues of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  offset by a  decrease in license revenue 
the increase in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to an increase in services provided to unrelated entities on a fee for service basis associated with an increase in product development services including an increase in the number of completed manufacturing runs compared to the prior year 
we expect to continue to generate contract manufacturing revenue during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of in process customer related projects and the anticipated demand for avid s services under signed contracts and outstanding proposals 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in revenues of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  combined with an increase in license revenue of  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue was primarily due to the increase in services provided to unrelated entities on a fee for service basis combined with the collection of disputed services in the amount of  during fiscal year associated with manufacturing services performed during the year ended april  since collectibility of the receivable was not reasonably assured  in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition  we did not recognize revenue in prior years and the related work in process inventory was written off and included in cost of contract manufacturing during the year ended april  cost of contract manufacturing year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in cost of contract manufacturing of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was directly related to the current year increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenues improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was primarily due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenues combined with improved efficiencies in costs associated with manufacturing runs 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenues improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year in fiscal year  we reported an increase in cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the write off of unusable work in process inventory generated for an unrelated entity combined with an estimated contract loss provision for the same entity during fiscal year research and development expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab tnt cotara vta and anti angiogenesis agents vea total r d expenses o anti phosphatidylserine anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab the increase in anti ps immunotherapeutics program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in clinical trial and manufacturing expenses to support the advancement of four clinical trials using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors and one clinical trial for the treatment of hcv patients co infected with hiv 
during fiscal year  we submitted two separate phase ii clinical protocols in india  one to treat patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc and one to treat patients with breast cancer  both of which received initial protocol approval in january in addition  we initiated and completed patient enrollment in the first part of our two stage phase ii study in the republic of georgia and treated patients with breast cancer using our product bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy 
these expenses were further supplemented by increases in pre clinical development expenses to support the possible expansion of bavituximab to treat other viral infections 
the foregoing increases in anti ps immunotherapeutics were offset by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense associated with shares of common stock earned by employees in the prior fiscal year under a stock bonus plan  which expired in fiscal year o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara tnt program expenses remained in line with the prior year and increased slightly by  as we continued our efforts to support the advancement of our two ongoing cotara clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer in the us and india 
o vascular targeting agents vtas and anti angiogenesis agents the increase in vta and anti angiogenesis agents program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in manufacturing expenses as we developed a manufacturing process at a  liter scale for our anti angiogensis product 
these increases in manufacturing expense were offset by decreases in pre clinical program expenses associated with our vta program 
although vta and anti angiogenesis program expenses increased overall compared to the prior year  we have significantly curtailed these research efforts and are currently seeking partners to further advance these technologies 
o vasopermeation enhancements agents veas vea program expenses remained in line with the prior year and decreased slightly by  as we have initiated efforts to significantly curtail our development expenses associated with this program and are focusing our efforts on seeking partners to further advance this technology 
based on our current projections  which includes estimated clinical trial enrollment rates that are always uncertain  we expect research and development expenses in fiscal year to remain in line with fiscal year during fiscal year  we expect to direct the majority of our research and development expenses on our bavituximab and cotara clinical programs 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab tnt cotara vta and anti angiogenesis agents vea total r d expenses o anti phosphatidylserine anti ps immunotherapeutics bavituximab the increase in anti ps immunotherapeutics program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily from continuing efforts to support the development and clinical development of our first anti ps immunotherapeutics agent  bavituximab 
during fiscal year  clinical trial expenses increased as we advanced the development of two separate phase i clinical programs using bavituximab for the treatment of advanced solid cancers and chronic hepatitis c virus infection hcv  including the initiation and completion of a phase ib study in india during fiscal year using bavituximab for the treatment of advanced solid cancers in combination with chemotherapy 
these increases in clinical trial expenses were further supplemented with increases in payroll and related expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  and non cash expenses associated with shares of common stock earned by employees under our february stock bonus plan 
these amounts were offset by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expenses associated with non employee consultants 
these increases in anti ps immunotherapeutics program expenses were further offset by decreases in i manufacturing expenses incurred in fiscal year regarding manufacturing commercial scale up efforts to support our clinical trials  ii outside antibody development fees related to a humanized antibody in development  and iii technology access fees primarily associated with clinical milestones achieved during fiscal year in accordance with third party licensing agreements 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara the increase in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses to support the cotara dose confirmation and dosimetry clinical trial for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm and the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial in india for patients with gbm at first relapse 
these increases in clinical trial expenses were further supplemented with increases in payroll and related expenses to support our cotara clinical studies and in house tnt research and development efforts combined with an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  o vascular targeting agents vtas and anti angiogenesis agents the increase in vta and anti angiogenesis agents program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses  manufacturing expenses and outside research studies associated with increased efforts to advance the pre clinical development of our vta and anti angiogenesis agents programs 
these increases were further supplemented by an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  o vasopermeation enhancements agents veas the increase in vea program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses  laboratory materials and outside antibody development studies associated with increased efforts to advance the pre clinical development of our vea program 
these increases were further supplemented by an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  the above vea increases were offset with a decrease in technology license fees incurred in fiscal year associated with an annual license fee due under a former license agreement 
looking beyond the next twelve months  it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with pre clinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our studies to move forward from phase i clinical studies to phase ii and phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of future costs associated with our pre clinical candidates  including vascular targeting agents  anti angiogensis agents  and vasopermeation enhancement agents  which costs are dependent on the success of pre clinical development 
we are not certain whether these product candidates will be successful or whether we will incur any additional costs beyond pre clinical development given our above stated intent to find partners to move these programs forward  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  and the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs 
we or our potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  pre clinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting  and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the united states food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  legal and accounting fees  stock based compensation expense  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses  corporate legal fees  and travel and related expenses 
payroll and related expenses increased  from  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in headcount to support increased operations combined with an increase in consulting fees primarily associated with the expansion of our business development activities 
corporate legal fees increased  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily related to legal fees associated with the lawsuit described in this annual report on form k under part i  item  legal proceedings  combined with legal fees associated with other corporate matters 
travel and related expenses increased  from  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year primarily due to increased business development efforts in the us  europe and asia and increased participation in corporate and investor relation activities 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset with a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r and non cash expenses associated with shares of common stock earned by employees in the prior year under a stock bonus plan  which expired in fiscal year year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to decreases in corporate legal fees  investor and public relation fees  and payroll and related expenses 
corporate legal fees decreased  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to corporate legal fees incurred in fiscal year associated with a legal settlement related to certain technology agreements with a university that was reached in march investor and public relation fees decreased  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to consolidating the outsourcing of our investor and public relation activities 
payroll and related expenses remained in line with fiscal year and decreased slightly from  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset with an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year due to the adoption of sfas no 
r on may  and the issuance of non cash stock bonuses during fiscal year associated with the achievement of pre determined milestones as set forth in the company s february stock bonus plan  which were offset by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expenses associated with non employee consultants 
in addition  we incurred incremental increases in other general corporate related expenses primarily associated with facility related expenses and directors and officers insurance fees 
recovery of note receivable year ended april  compared to the year ended april  and april  during fiscal year  we recovered a previously fully reserved note receivable in the amount of  which amount did not occur in either fiscal year or fiscal year as further discussed in note  recovery of note receivable to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is due to a  decrease in other income primarily associated with the sale of a trademark name in the prior year combined with a  decrease in interest income primarily resulting from lower prevailing interest rates 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is due to a  increase in interest income as a result of a higher average cash balance on hand and higher prevailing interest rates during fiscal year compared to fiscal year offset with a net decrease in other income of  the net decrease in other income is primarily due to  of other income recorded during fiscal year in connection with a legal settlement related to certain technology agreements with a university  which amount was offset by the sale of a trademark name during fiscal year in the amount of  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenues we recognize revenues pursuant to the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we comply with financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
revenues associated with licensing agreements primarily consist of nonrefundable up front license fees and milestone payments 
revenues under licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
nonrefundable up front license fees received under license agreements  whereby continued performance or future obligations are considered inconsequential to the relevant licensed technology  are generally recognized as revenue upon delivery of the technology 
nonrefundable up front license fees  whereby we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligations  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the term of the performance obligation or relevant agreement 
milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon completion of the milestone assuming there are no other continuing obligations 
under some license agreements  the obligation period may not be contractually defined 
under these circumstances  we must exercise judgment in estimating the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided to enable the licensee to practice the license 
contract manufacturing revenues are generally recognized once the service has been provided and or upon shipment of the product to the customer 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf released issue eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
eitf summarized the eitf s views on when revenue should be recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services  or the net amount retained the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a supplier because it has earned a fee or commission 
in addition  the eitf released issue eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  and issue eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf summarized the eitf s views on how the seller of goods should classify in the income statement amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling and the costs associated with shipping and handling 
eitf summarized the eitf s views on when the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue or as a reduction of expenses incurred 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with eitf  eitf and eitf whereby we record revenue for the gross amount billed to customers the cost of raw materials  supplies  and shipping  plus the related handling mark up fee and we record the cost of the amounts billed as cost of sales as we act as a principal in these transactions 
stock based compensation expense we currently maintain four equity compensation plans which provide for the granting of options to purchase shares of our common stock at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
the granting of options are share based payments and are subject to the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including grants of employee stock options 
on may   we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and  accordingly  stock based compensation cost recognized beginning may  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective method results for fiscal year have not been restated 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model and are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period typically two to four years 
use of a valuation model requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility is based on daily historical volatility of our stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options granted prior to november  was based on the expected time to exercise using the simplified method allowable under the security and exchange commission s sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 

effective november   the expected term reflects actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options and will be applied to all option grants subsequent to october  the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our losses from operations for fiscal years ended april  and included stock based compensation expenses of  and  respectively 
as of april   the total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options was  this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continually monitor our allowance for doubtful accounts for all receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables and we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on these factors at that point in time 
as of april   based on our analysis of our accounts receivable balances and based on historical collectibility of receivables from our current customers we determined no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents compared to  at april  we have expended substantial funds on i the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and ii funding the operations of our wholly owned subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue in fiscal year therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
we will need additional capital to support the costs of our clinical and pre clinical programs through one or more methods including either equity or debt financing 
as of april   we had an aggregate of approximately  shares available under our existing effective form s registration statements for possible future registered transactions 
in addition  we filed a separate shelf registration statement on form s  file number  under which we may issue  from time to time  in one or more offerings  shares of our common stock for remaining gross proceeds of up to  we may also raise additional capital though negotiating licensing or collaboration agreements for our technology platforms 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiary avid bioservices  inc  represents an additional asset in our portfolio and we are actively pursuing strategic initiatives for avid as a means of raising additional capital 
we have not classified the related assets as held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as the partnering or sale of such assets are not currently probable under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements or from a potential strategic transaction related to our subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which includes projected revenues from existing customers of avid bioservices  inc  combined with the projected revenues from our government contract  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers and from our government contract to meet our obligations as they become due through at least fiscal year there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of contracts and technical challenges  which would reduce or delay our future projected cash inflows 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by changes in our net loss 
however  cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported net loss as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during the year ended april   cash used in operating activities increased  to  compared to  for the year ended april  the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss reported during fiscal year after taking into consideration non cash operating expenses of  this amount was offset by a net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount of  the increase in our fiscal year net loss was primarily due to current period increases in cost of contract manufacturing  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  which were offset by an increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
the changes in operating activities as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities are as follows year ended april  net loss  as reported less non cash operating expenses depreciation and amortization stock based compensation and common stock issued under stock bonus plan amortization of expenses paid in shares of common stock loss gain on sale of property net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities net change in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during the same prior year period 
this increase in net cash used in investing activities of  was primarily due to a  increase in property acquisitions to support our current operations combined with a  increase in other assets 
these increases in net cash used in investing activities were offset by the receipt of  in net security deposits from ge capital corporation during the current fiscal year upon the payment in full of various note payable amounts 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash provided of  for the same prior year period 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was primarily due to proceeds received under a security purchase agreement whereby we sold and issued a total of  shares of our common stock in exchange for net proceeds of  which was supplemented with net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock under a security purchase agreement in the amount of  supplemented with net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of april   aggregated by type payments due by period in thousands total year years years after years operating leases  net capital lease obligation other long term liabilities minimum license obligations total contractual obligations represents our i facility operating lease in tustin  california under a non cancelable lease agreement  ii facility operating lease in houston  texas  which has a three year lease term under a first amendment to lease agreement dated march   and iii various office equipment leases  which generally have five year lease terms 
represents capital lease agreements to finance certain office and laboratory equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents licensing agreements we periodically enter into with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future milestone payments based on product development success 
we do not anticipate making any milestone payments under any of our licensing agreements for at least the next fiscal year 
in addition  milestone payments beyond fiscal year cannot be predicted due to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results and development milestones and therefore  cannot be reasonably predicted or estimated at the present time
