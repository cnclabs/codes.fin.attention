in may  we announced new marketing and sales initiatives designed to accelerate growth and expand our leadership position in the compensation and employee performance management markets 
over the next two years  we plan to re invest up to million in marketing and hire up to sales people to support new product offerings 
we expect to fund these initiatives with our operating cash flow 
given our current cash  accounts receivable and available borrowings under our credit facility  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our business and meet our contractual obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in the future in the event that we pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies or experience operating losses that exceed our expectations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
in the event that additional financing is required  we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms or at all 
during the last three fiscal years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following table discloses our contractual payment obligations as of march  as of march   we did not have any material purchase obligations  capital leases  or other material long term commitments reflected on our balance sheet 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases contractual commitments total the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment  complexity and effect on materiality 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenues from subscription agreements for our on demand software and related services when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
our subscription agreements generally contain multiple service elements and deliverables 
these elements include access to our software and often specify initial services including implementation and training 
except under limited circumstances  our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  issued by the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  in may  we define all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements as a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  recognize all associated revenue over the subscription period  which is typically one to five years in length 
in the event professional services relating to implementation are required  we generally do not recognize revenue until such implementation is complete 
in applying the guidance in eitf  we determined that we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription to our on demand software after delivery of specified initial services 
we therefore account for our subscription arrangements and our related service fees as a single unit 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted 
table of contents tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
as of march   we have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold and measurement requirements a tax position must meet before recognized a benefit in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting for interim periods and disclosures for uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of fin on april  did not result in the recognition of a tax liability for any previously unrecognized tax benefits and did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations as we have a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets

we capitalize certain internal software development costs under the provisions of statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be charged to operations as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and the post implementation stages are expensed as incurred 
certain qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized as property  equipment and software 
these costs generally consist of internal labor during configuration  coding  and testing activities 
capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete  management with the relevant authority authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project  and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended 
these costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  generally three years 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to pay us 
the provision is based on our historical experience and for specific customers that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these customers  we perform ongoing reviews of all customers that have breached their payment terms  as well as those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
in addition  we have experienced significant growth in the number of our customers  and we have less payment history to rely upon with these customers 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new customers and evaluate these customers over time 
to the extent that our future collections differ from our assumptions based on historical experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
stock based compensation 
we follow the provisions of fas r  which requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements over the vesting period and that such expense be measured at the fair value of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
beginning in fiscal year  we have used the black scholes option pricing model to value our option grants and determine the related compensation expense 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had adopted sfas  but in accordance with sfas  we had elected not to apply fair value based accounting for awards under our employee stock incentive plan through march  
table of contents instead  we measured compensation expense for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations and provided pro forma disclosures as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas we estimate our expected volatility based on that of our publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data from our traded share price 
management believes that the historical volatility of our stock price does not best represent the expected volatility of the stock price 
until february  we were a private company and therefore lack sufficient company specific historical and implied volatility information 
we intend to continue to consistently use the same group of publicly traded peer companies to determine volatility in the future until such time that sufficient information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available or that the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is equal to the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
the expected term of the options granted was determined based upon review of the period that our share based awards are expected to be outstanding and is estimated based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual term of the awards  vesting schedules  employee turnover and expectations of employee exercise behavior 
the stock price volatility and expected terms utilized in the calculation of fair values involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the vesting period of the option 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
therefore  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options with the adoption of sfas r 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience  our growing employee base and the historical limited liquidity of our common stock 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we recognized stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r in the amount of   and  in years ended march   and  respectively 
as of march   we had million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based compensation awards granted under our equity plans 
the unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we follow the guidance of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets or sfas in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and certain intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset is greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historically or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  significant adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a decline in our credit rating  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the estimation of the fair values of goodwill and the reporting units to which it pertains requires the use of discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
these estimates will be determined by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
determining the fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas  as issued  are effective for the fiscal years beginning after november  however  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp that amended sfas to delay the effective date for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of fsp we adopted the required provisions of sfas as of april  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  although we adopted sfas as of april   we have not yet elected the fair value option for any items permitted under sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the guidance will become effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year beginning after december  sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning april  sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependant upon acquisitions at that time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in any material respect 
interest rate sensitivity 
interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
however  based on the nature and current level of our investments  which are primarily cash and debt obligations  we believe that there is no material risk of exposure
