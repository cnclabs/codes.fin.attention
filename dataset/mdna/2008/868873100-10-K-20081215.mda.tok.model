item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
any discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview surmodics is a leading provider of drug delivery and surface modification technologies to the healthcare industry 
in november  we announced that we were changing our organizational structure so that we will now be organized into four clinically and market focused business units cardiovascular  ophthalmology  in vitro technologies  and brookwood pharmaceuticals 
we believe that this structure will improve the visibility  marketing and adoption of the company s broad array of technologies within specific markets and help its customers in the medical device  pharmaceutical and life science industries solve unmet clinical needs 
in addition  a new centralized research and development function has been formed to serve the needs of the company s clinically and market focused business units 
brookwood pharmaceuticals research and development operations will remain unchanged 
because this change occurred in fiscal and is not useful in explaining our fiscal results  we will primarily describe our business below as it operated in fiscal until november  the company was organized into three operating segments composed of seven technology centered and industry focused business units 
the drug delivery operating segment contains the drug delivery business unit  which was responsible for technologies dedicated to site specific delivery of drugs  the ophthalmology business unit  which was dedicated to the advancement of treatments for eye diseases  such as age related macular degeneration amd and diabetic macular edema dme  two of the leading causes of blindness  and the brookwood pharmaceuticals unit  which provides proprietary polymer based 
table of contents technologies to companies developing improved pharmaceutical products 
the hydrophilic and other operating segment consisted of three business units the hydrophilic technologies business unit  which focused on enhancing medical devices with advanced lubricious coatings that facilitate their placement and maneuverability in the body  the regenerative technologies business unit  which developed platforms intended to augment or replace tissue organ function eg  cell encapsulation applications  or to modify medical devices to facilitate tissue organ recovery through natural repair mechanisms eg  hemo biocompatible or prohealing coatings  and the orthopedics business unit  which was committed to innovative solutions for orthopedics patients using proven surmodics technologies  and creating new technology solutions to existing patient care gaps in the orthopedics field 
the in vitro operating segment contains the in vitro technologies business unit  which includes our microarray slide products  our stabilization products  antigens and substrates for immunoassay diagnostic tests  our in vitro diagnostic format technology and our synthetic ecm cell culture products 
revenue in each of our operating segments in fiscal is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our patented drug delivery and surface modification technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the vast majority typically in excess of of revenue in the royalties and license fees category is in the form of royalties  the sale of polymers and reagent chemicals  stabilization products  antigens and substrates and microarray slides to the diagnostics and biomedical research industry  and research and development fees generated on customer projects 
revenue should be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of coated products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and activity level associated with customer development projects  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to licensees  and the timing of future acquisitions we complete  if any 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we have treated our three operating segments as one reportable segment 
we made this determination because a significant percentage of our employees provide support services including research and development to each operating segment  technology and products from each operating segment are marketed to the same or similar customers  each operating segment uses the same sales and marketing resources  and each operating segment operates in the same regulatory environment 
we will be reviewing our segment reporting for fiscal as a result of the changes to our organizational structure in november in june  we signed a collaborative research and license agreement with merck co  inc merck to pursue the joint development and commercialization of the i vation sustained drug delivery system with triamcinolone acetonide and other products that combine merck proprietary drug compounds with the i vation system for the treatment of serious retinal diseases 
under the terms of our agreement with merck  we received an up front license fee of million and had the potential to receive up to an additional million in fees and development milestones associated with the successful product development and attainment of appropriate us and eu regulatory approvals for these new combination products 
in september  merck gave notice that it was terminating the collaborative research and license agreement  as well as the supply agreement entered into in june  following a strategic review of merck s business and product development portfolio 
the termination is expected to be effective december  we anticipate that the revenue deferred under the accounting treatment required by emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  totaling million as of september   will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we anticipate recognizing a million milestone payment from merck associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 
this program terminated days following the notice given in september in july  we acquired brookwood pharmaceuticals  inc brookwood by paying cash to southern research institute  which owned the capital stock of brookwood 
brookwood is a drug delivery company based in birmingham  alabama that provides its proprietary polymer based technologies to companies developing improved pharmaceutical products 
brookwood is a wholly owned subsidiary of surmodics and is reported as part of our drug delivery operating segment 
our consolidated financial statements have included the operating results of brookwood since the date of the acquisition 

table of contents in august  we acquired all of the assets of biofx laboratories  inc biofx by paying cash to biofx stockholders 
based in owings mills  maryland  biofx is a leading provider of innovative reagents and substrates for the biomedical research and medical diagnostic markets 
biofx is a wholly owned subsidiary of surmodics and is reported as part of our in vitro operating segment 
our consolidated financial statements have included the operating results of biofx since the date of the acquisition 
in november  we acquired a portfolio of intellectual property and collaborative drug delivery projects from pr pharmaceuticals  inc  a drug delivery company specializing in injectable  biodegradable sustained release formulations 
the proprietary technologies we acquired complement and enhance the existing portfolio of drug delivery capabilities available from surmodics and brookwood by providing a broader toolkit for protein delivery and the ability to use smaller gauge needles for microparticle injections 
in addition  the multiple customer development programs we assumed complemented the diversified portfolio of customer projects at brookwood and we believe will further leverage the investment we are making in cgmp manufacturing facilities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements is based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following are critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or delivery has occurred if the terms specify destination  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
however  when there are additional performance requirements  revenue is recognized when such requirements have been satisfied 
royalty revenue is generated when a licensed customer sells products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with a quarterly report 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon achievement of the milestone and meeting specific revenue recognition criteria 
we recognize initial license fees over the term of the related agreement 
minimum royalty fees are recognized in the period earned 
product sales to third parties are recognized at the time of shipment  provided that an order has been received  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and returns can be reasonably estimated 
our sales terms provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty policy 
payment terms are generally set at days 
generally  revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
when we have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we comply with eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and recognize each element as it is earned 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized except for services related to the merck agreement  which are recognized as incurred 
customer advances are accounted for as a liability until all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value were less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment charge 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the fair value assigned to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed in connection with the company s acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under certain situations  interim 
table of contents impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
surmodics has determined that its reporting units are its brookwood business unit  a component of the drug delivery operating segment  and the in vitro operating segment 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and did not record an impairment charge 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step one of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used a valuation technique based on multiples of revenue and book value for comparable companies since the technique is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
the comparison companies selected have operations comparable to each of the surmodics reporting units for which indefinite lived assets were being evaluated 
investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities and are classified as available for sale or held to maturity at september  our investment policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
available for sale investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
our evaluation of the available for sale investments resulted in loss recognition of million related to our investment in octoplus nv included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet in fiscal  as we determined the loss to be an other than temporary impairment based on a significant decline in the stock price 
the impairment of the octoplus nv investment has resulted in a new cost basis 
investments which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
if there is an other than temporary impairment in the fair value of any individual security classified as held to maturity  the company will write down the security to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to other income loss 
interest on debt securities  including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  is included in other income loss 
realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities  which are included in other income loss  are determined using the specific identification method 
income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
when preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in the results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we had total deferred tax assets in excess of total deferred tax liabilities of million as of september  and million as of september   including valuation allowances of million as of september  and million as 
table of contents of september  the valuation allowances related to impairment losses on investments and were recorded because the company does not currently foresee future capital gains within the allowable carry forward and carry back periods to offset these capital losses when they are recognized 
as such  no tax benefit has been recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on october  the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of september  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
million of these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of september   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
fiscal years  and remain subject to examination by federal tax authorities 
tax returns for state and local jurisdictions for fiscal years through remain subject to examination by state and local tax authorities 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or local jurisdiction  all years remain subject to examination by the tax authorities 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
within the next months  we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of adopting this new standard as well as changes in unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal results of operations years ended september  and fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands increase change revenue drug delivery hydrophilic and other in vitro total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million or from fiscal we experienced growth in all three operating segments  as detailed in the table above and further explained in the narrative below 
drug delivery 
revenue in the drug delivery segment increased to million in fiscal the increase in total revenue reflects a significant increase in research and development fees  which was partially offset by an decrease in royalties and license fees related to drug delivery and ophthalmology projects 
brookwood contributed million and million in revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal results included brookwood for only two months  as the acquisition closed on july  drug delivery derives a substantial portion of its revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
the decrease in drug delivery royalties and license fees principally reflects a decrease in royalty revenue from cordis as a result of lower cypher sales  partially offset by an increase in royalties and license fees from ophthalmology customers  as well as an increase in research and development fees from drug delivery and ophthalmology customers 
we received million in license fees from merck in association with the collaborative 
table of contents research and license agreement we signed in fiscal however  we recognized as revenue only a small portion of these fees  as well as the initial million license fee from merck paid in fiscal  as we are amortizing these amounts over the estimated economic life of the technology we licensed to merck 
fiscal sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices to cordis decreased significantly compared with the prior year 
the cypher stent  from which we derive a substantial amount of our drug delivery revenue  faces continuing competition from drug eluting stents manufactured by boston scientific  medtronic and abbott 
these stents compete directly with the cypher stent both domestically and internationally 
the company also receives a royalty on the medtronic endeavor drug eluting stent  but the associated royalty revenue is reflected in the hydrophilic and other segment 
in addition to competition among the various players  the total size of the drug eluting stent market has decreased significantly in the past two years as a result of concerns about product safety  mostly related to potential clotting associated with stents 
therefore  future royalty and reagent sales revenue could decrease due to lower cypher stent sales as a result of the overall market contraction and the ongoing and expected future competition 
we anticipate that quarterly royalty revenue from the cypher stent may be volatile throughout fiscal and beyond as the various marketers of drug eluting stents continue competing in the marketplace and as others enter the marketplace 
the inclusion of brookwood  which contributed to drug delivery revenue for only two months in fiscal  impacted the overall revenue and revenue mix in fiscal  as a substantial majority of brookwood s revenue is comprised of research and development fees 
our research and development revenue increased to million in fiscal and it constituted a majority of total drug delivery revenue 
in september  following a strategic review of its business and product development portfolio  merck gave notice that it was terminating the collaborative research and license agreement as well as the supply agreement entered into in june the termination is expected to be effective december  we anticipate that the revenue deferred under the accounting treatment required by emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  totaling million as of september   will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we anticipate recognizing a million milestone payment from merck associated with the termination of the triamcinolone acetonide development program 
this program terminated days following the notice given in september hydrophilic and other 
hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  primarily as a result of growth in royalties and license fees and growth in research and development fees 
in contrast to our drug delivery segment  where a significant percentage of revenue is attributable to cordis  there are several dozen licensees and an even larger number of coated products generating royalties in our hydrophilic and other segment 
the growth in royalties principally reflects increased sales of coated products already on the market  and to a lesser extent newly introduced licensed products 
in vitro 
revenue in the in vitro segment increased to million 
the increase was mainly attributable to increased product sales  principally as a result of the addition of million of biofx products sold during the year as compared with biofx product sales of million in fiscal operating results of biofx have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since august  the product sales increase was substantially offset by a decrease in royalties and license fees 
royalties and license fees likely will decrease in fiscal in vitro derives a significant percentage of its revenue from ge healthcare and abbott laboratories 
royalty revenue generated under our diagnostic format patent license agreement with abbott laboratories the abbott agreement is expected to cease following the expiration of the licensed patents in december consistent with our revenue recognition practices  royalty revenue is recognized as licensees report it to us  which typically occurs one quarter following the sales of the licensee s products 
accordingly  we expect royalties generated under the abbott agreement to extend into the second quarter of fiscal royalty revenue from ge healthcare decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of the transition to a non exclusive license in january we re acquired the codelink microarray slide product line from ge healthcare in september this will eliminate future royalty revenue from this customer for these products 
product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with reported last year 
the slight decrease in product margins 
table of contents reflects the mix of products sold in the period in particular  some of our microarray slides and brookwood polymer products carry lower margins than our reagent and stabilization products 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of brookwood and biofx to our operations  which together incurred total r d expenses of million in fiscal compared with million for fiscal fiscal amounts include brookwood and biofx from their respective acquisition dates through september  in addition compensation expenses have increased as we have added personnel to support customer and internal development projects 
as of september   our r d headcount has increased by or  growing from employees to  compared with september  we have also incurred higher costs related to our internal development projects  and million of out of pocket expenses were incurred in connection with our merck projects  for which we are reimbursed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of brookwood and biofx to our operations  which together incurred total sg a expenses of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal fiscal amounts include brookwood and biofx from their respective acquisition dates through september  our sg a stock based compensation costs were million higher in fiscal principally associated with second quarter transitions on our board of directors 
other income loss  net 
other loss was million in fiscal  compared with income of million in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a million impairment loss on our investment in octoplus nv  which we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on a significant decline in the stock price 
income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower investment balances and lower yields generated from our investment portfolio as interest rates declined over the past twelve months  as well as the early repayment of a note receivable associated with the fiscal sale of our contract manufacturing facility located in bloomington  minnesota 
income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was 
excluding the impact of the million impairment loss in fiscal since the company does not currently foresee offsetting capital gains that could offset this capital loss  no tax benefit has been recorded  the effective tax rate was 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was 
excluding the impact of the non tax deductible purchased in process research and development charges  the fiscal effective rate was 
the increase in the effective tax rate  adjusted for the one time items noted  reflects an increase in state tax contingency reserves in fiscal and a release of federal tax reserves in fiscal years ended september  and fiscal fiscal increase dollars in thousands decrease change revenue drug delivery hydrophilic and other in vitro total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million or from fiscal a decrease in drug delivery operating segment revenue was more than offset by growth in the hydrophilic and other and in vitro operating segments  as detailed in the table above and further explained in the narrative below 
drug delivery 
revenue in the drug delivery segment decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in total revenue reflects a significant decrease in royalties and license fees  which was partially offset by an increase in research and development revenue related to drug delivery and ophthalmology projects and the addition of million in revenue from brookwood 

table of contents drug delivery derives a substantial portion of its revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the decrease in drug delivery royalties and license fees principally reflects decreased royalty revenue from cordis as a result of lower cypher sales 
partially offsetting the decrease attributable to cypher was an increase in royalties and license fees from ophthalmology customers  as well as an increase in research and development fees from drug delivery and ophthalmology customers 
we received a million license fee from merck in association with the collaborative research and license agreement that we signed in fiscal however we recognized as revenue only a small portion of this fee  and are amortizing the remaining amounts over the estimated economic life of the technology we licensed to merck 
as a result of merck s september notice of termination  we anticipate recognizing these amounts in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices to cordis decreased slightly when compared with the prior year 
hydrophilic and other 
hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  primarily as a result of growth in royalties and license fees and growth in reagent sales  partially offset by a decrease in research and development revenue 
in contrast to our drug delivery segment  where a significant percentage of revenue is attributable to cordis  there are several dozen licensees and an even larger number of coated products generating royalties in our hydrophilic and other segment 
the growth in royalties principally reflects increased sales of coated products already on the market  and to a lesser extent newly introduced licensed products 
in vitro 
revenue in the in vitro segment increased to million 
over of the increase was attributable to increased royalties and license fees 
the balance of the growth resulted from growth in sales of our stabilization products  antigens and substrates used by diagnostic kit manufacturers in immunoassay diagnostic tests 
we began selling recombinant autoimmune antigens in the first quarter of fiscal  and sales of biofx products following the acquisition of biofx in august contributed million of product sales to our results 
product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with reported in fiscal the decrease in product margins reflects the mix of products sold in the period in particular  some of our stabilization and antigen products  genomics slides and brookwood polymer products carry lower margins than our reagent products and higher depreciation costs on the manufacturing space at our eden prairie facility 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of brookwood and biofx to our operations  higher compensation expenses as we have added personnel to support customer projects and internal development projects  increased incentive and stock based compensation  and higher costs related to our internal development projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of brookwood and biofx to our operations  higher compensation expenses  and increased incentive and stock based compensation 
purchased in process research and development 
in july  we acquired all of the assets of brookwood 
results in the fourth quarter of fiscal include an in process research and development charge of million related to the brookwood acquisition 
the fair value of the in process research and development was determined by management 
other income loss  net 
other income was million in fiscal  compared with a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a million impairment loss on our investment in novocell  which we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase reflects higher yields generated from our investment portfolio 
income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was 
excluding the impact of the non tax deductible purchased in process research and development charges  the fiscal effective rate was 
excluding the impact of the million impairment loss in fiscal since the company does not currently foresee offsetting 
table of contents capital gains that could offset this capital loss  no tax benefit has been recorded  the effective tax rate was in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had working capital of million  of which million consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
working capital increased million from the september  level driven principally by lower accrued income taxes payable 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments totaled million at september   a slight increase from million at september  the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
the company s policy requires that no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
the primary investment objective of the portfolio is to provide for the safety of principal and appropriate liquidity while meeting or exceeding a benchmark merrill lynch year government corporate index total rate of return 
management plans to continue to direct its investment advisors to manage the company s investments primarily for the safety of principal for the foreseeable future as it assesses other investment opportunities and uses of its investments 
the company had positive cash flows from operating activities of approximately million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the following table depicts our cash flows from operations for each of fiscal and for the years ended september  dollars in thousands net income depreciation and amortization stock based compensation purchased in process research and development impairment loss on investment net other operating activities net change in deferred revenue net change in other operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities while net income in fiscal increased compared with fiscal  there was a reduction of cash provided by operating activities 
license fees and milestone payments received from merck in fiscal totaled million while in fiscal we received a million up front license fee from merck 
the decline in cash flow from merck as well as lower cypher stent royalties contributed significantly to the decline in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal we conduct a significant majority of our operations at our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters and at our brookwood subsidiary located in birmingham  alabama 
in addition to our eden prairie and birmingham locations  we lease approximately  square feet of commercial office space in irvine  california  where our ophthalmology business unit conducts a portion of its operations  and approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in eden prairie 
in november  we announced the consolidation of all of our eden prairie personnel into our owned facility as part of our reorganization efforts 
we estimate this consolidation will be substantially complete by the end of december in april we purchased a building for million which has approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space and is located near our present location in birmingham  alabama 
the warehouse portion of this building is being renovated to support the development and cgmp manufacturing needs of our customers 

table of contents in september  we made a commitment to purchase for million certain additional sublicense rights and the accompanying future royalty revenue streams under certain sublicenses through an amendment to our diagnostic format patent license with abbott laboratories 
prior to such amendment  we were receiving only a portion of the royalties under such sublicenses 
the first million installment was paid in november we made an additional million installment payment in june and the remaining million installment was paid in june in january  we made an equity investment of approximately million in octoplus nv  a company based in the netherlands active in the development of pharmaceutical formulations incorporating novel biodegradable polymers 
in may  we made an additional investment of approximately  in october  we made an additional investment of million  bringing our total investment to million  representing an ownership interest of less than 
also in october  octoplus nv common stock began trading on an international exchange following an initial public offering of its common stock 
with a readily determinable fair market value  the company treats the investment in octoplus nv as an available for sale investment rather than a cost method investment 
in fiscal we incurred an impairment loss of million on our investment in octoplus nv based on the decline in fair value of the common stock 
our new cost basis in the investment is million 
in january  we entered into a merger agreement whereby surmodics acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying approximately million in cash and issuing  shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders  and agreeing to issue up to an additional  shares if certain development and commercial milestones are met 
as of september   we issued  shares of surmodics common stock to the shareholders of innorx upon the successful completion of two milestones 
upon the successful completion of the remaining development and commercial milestones involving innorx technology acquired in the transaction  we will be required to issue up to approximately  additional shares of our common stock to the stockholders of innorx 
in july  we made equity investments in paragon intellectual properties  llc paragon and apollo therapeutics  llc apollo  a paragon subsidiary 
the paragon and apollo investments totaled million 
surmodics made an additional equity investment totaling million  based upon successful completion of specified development milestones  in the third quarter of fiscal our investment in paragon represents an ownership interest of approximately and the investment in apollo represents an ownership interest of 
we account for our investments in paragon and apollo under the equity method 
in october  paragon announced that it had restructured  moving from a limited liability company with seven subsidiaries to a single c corporation named nexeon medsystems  inc we will continue to account for our investment in paragon and apollo under the equity method in the first quarter of fiscal  as both entities report results to us on a one quarter lag 
commencing with the second quarter of fiscal we expect to account for our investment in nexeon under the cost method as our ownership is less than 
in july  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with southern research institute whereby we acquired of the capital stock of brookwood pharmaceuticals  inc brookwood for million in cash on the closing date  and up to an additional million in cash upon the successful achievement of specified milestones 
in the second quarter of fiscal  a milestone was achieved and million of additional purchase price was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
based in birmingham  alabama  brookwood specializes in proprietary injectable microparticles and implants to provide sustained delivery of drugs being developed by leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device clients as well as emerging companies 
this acquisition has helped us broaden our technology offerings to our customers  diversify the range of markets in which we participate  expand our customer base  and enhance our pipeline of potential revenue generating opportunities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in august  we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire of the capital stock of biofx laboratories  inc biofx for million in cash on the closing date  and up to an additional million in cash upon the successful achievement of specified milestones 
in the first quarter of fiscal  a milestone was achieved and million of additional purchase price was recorded as an increase to goodwill

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale and held to maturity securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
