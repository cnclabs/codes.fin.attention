the company s long term growth will depend on the development and implementation of newer retail concepts such as janie and jack  gymboree outlet  and crazy  as well as continued investment in its core retail brand  gymboree 
as such  the company expects to continue to devote time and effort to evaluating  developing  and testing new concepts when it perceives opportunities in the marketplace 
such efforts inevitably require significant management attention at all phases of the process and  for those concepts that the company determines to launch  significant capital expenditures and losses during the early years of operation 
fiscal results include an operating loss of per diluted share related to the company s new crazy concept 
such losses are expected to continue in fiscal during  the company plans to open approximately new stores  including gymboree stores  gymboree outlet stores  janie and jack shops  and crazy stores

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
share based compensation 
in fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based compensation sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and began accounting for share based compensation using a fair valued based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and expensed over the requisite service period of the award 
the company recognizes share based compensation expense on a straight line basis for options and awards with time based service conditions  and on an accelerated basis for awards with performance conditions see note 
determining the appropriate fair value model  calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date and amortizing the fair value over the requisite service period requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected term and forfeiture rates 
the company develops its estimates based on historical data and market information  which can change significantly over time 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to value options and shares issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
restricted stock units and shares are valued based on the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the company estimates stock price volatility based on an average historical volatility of its stock 
expected term and forfeiture rate assumptions are also derived from historical data  giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior 
had the company used alternative valuation methodologies or assumptions  the amount expensed for share based awards could be significantly different 
inventory valuation 
the company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and reduces prices to sell that merchandise 
the company takes a physical count of inventories in all stores once a year  and in some stores twice a year 
the company performs cycle counts of inventory for its retail distribution center and online stores throughout the year 
the company records an inventory shrink adjustment upon physical counts and also provides for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date 
our inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends 
asset impairment 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets at retail stores are reviewed for impairment once the related store has been open for a minimum of to months  depending on the brand 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed that are under long term leases  the company records a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between its rent and the rate at which it expects to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
the company s estimate of future cash flows is based on experience and occasionally third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors that are difficult to predict such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions 

table of contents workers compensation 
the company is partially self insured for workers compensation insurance 
the company records a liability based on claims filed and an actuarially determined amount of claims incurred  but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning the company s liability is subject to a high degree of variability due to external factors  including future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if the actual amount of claims filed exceeds estimates  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
co branded credit card 
the company has co branded credit card agreements the agreements with a third party bank the bank and visa usa inc for the issuance of a visa credit card bearing the gymboree brand and administration of an associated incentive program for cardholders 
the program offers incentives to cardholders  including a discount on purchases from gymboree using the gymboree visa card and rewards in the form of a gymboree gift card equal to of total non gymboree purchases 
the bank is the sole owner of the accounts issued under the program and absorbs all losses associated with non payment by the cardholder and any fraudulent usage of the accounts by third parties 
the company is responsible for redeeming the incentives  including the issuance of any gift cards 
the bank pays fees to the company based on the number of credit card accounts opened and card usage and makes certain guaranteed minimum annual payments 
visa usa inc also pays fees to the company based on card usage 
cardholder incentives are funded from the fees paid by the bank to the company 
the company recognizes revenues related to the agreements as follows new account fees are recognized as retail revenues on a straight line basis over the average estimated life of the credit card relationship  currently estimated to be three years 
credit card usage fees are recognized as retail revenues as actual credit card usage occurs 
minimum guaranteed annual payments  which exceed amounts earned based on the number of accounts opened and card usage  are recognized as retail revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the credit card relationship  currently estimated to be three years 
rewards earned are recorded as gift card liabilities and recognized as retail revenues when the gift cards are redeemed 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized at the point of sale in retail stores 
online revenue is recorded when the company estimates merchandise is delivered to the customer 
customers generally receive merchandise within a few days of shipment 
shipping fees received from customers are included in net sales and the associated shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
the company also sells gift cards in its retail store locations and through its online stores 
revenue is recognized in the period that the gift card is redeemed 
the company recognizes unredeemed gift card balances over three years old as other income 
customers may earn gymbucks and redeem them for merchandise at a discount during the redemption period 
one half of the gymbucks coupon value is earned by customers when the minimum purchase requirement is met during the earning period  and the other half is earned when the additional purchase requirement is met during the redemption period 
a liability is recorded for all gymbucks earned  but not redeemed  within an accounting period 
sales are presented net of a sales return reserve  which is estimated based on historical return trends 
if actual returns or gymbucks redemptions exceed or fall short of estimates  adjustments to sales returns and markdowns may be recorded in the future 
income taxes 
the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the company is subject to periodic 
table of contents audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years
