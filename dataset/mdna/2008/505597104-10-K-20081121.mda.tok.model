item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the laclede group  inc 
introduction this management s discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the laclede group  inc laclede group or the company and its subsidiaries 
it includes management s view of factors that affect its business  explanations of past financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior year periods  and their effects on overall financial condition and liquidity 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
results of operations laclede group s earnings are primarily derived from the regulated activities of its largest subsidiary  laclede gas company laclede gas or the utility  missouri s largest natural gas distribution company 
laclede gas is regulated by the missouri public service commission mopsc or commission and serves the city of st 
louis and parts of ten other counties in eastern missouri 
laclede gas delivers natural gas to retail customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the mopsc 
the utility s earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy 
the utility s innovative weather mitigation rate design lessens the impact of weather volatility on laclede gas customers during cold winters and stabilizes the utility s earnings by recovering fixed costs more evenly during the heating season 
due to the seasonal nature of the business of laclede gas  laclede group s earnings are seasonal in nature and are typically concentrated in the november through april period  which generally corresponds with the heating season 
on march   the company completed the sale of of its interest in its wholly owned subsidiary sm p utility resources  inc sm p to stripe acquisition  inc an affiliate of kohlberg management vi  llc for million in cash  subject to certain closing and post closing adjustments 
sm p is an underground facilities locating and marking business that formerly comprised laclede group s non regulated services operating segment 
the sales agreement included representations  warranties  and indemnification provisions customary for such transactions and was filed as an exhibit to the march  form q 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the results of operations for sm p are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and its associated assets and liabilities are classified separately in the consolidated balance sheets 
laclede energy resources  inc ler is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non regulated basis 
ler markets natural gas to both on system utility transportation customers and customers outside of laclede gas traditional service territory  including large retail and wholesale customers 
as such  ler s operations and customer base are subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
other subsidiaries provide less than of consolidated revenues 
laclede group s strategy continues to include efforts to stabilize and improve the performance of its core utility  while developing non regulated businesses and taking a measured approach in the pursuit of additional growth opportunities that complement the utility business 

table of contents as for the utility  mitigating the impact of weather fluctuations on laclede gas customers while improving the ability to recover its authorized distribution costs and return continues to be a fundamental component of laclede group s strategy 
the utility s distribution costs are the essential  primarily fixed expenditures it must incur to operate and maintain a more than  mile natural gas distribution system and related storage facilities 
with regard to the storage facilities owned by laclede gas  management is currently undertaking an evaluation of the utility s natural gas storage field  which was developed more than years ago  to assess the field s current and future capabilities 
in addition  laclede gas is working to continually improve its ability to provide reliable natural gas service at a reasonable cost  while maintaining and building a secure and dependable infrastructure 
the settlement of the utility s rate case resulted in enhancements to the utility s weather mitigation rate design that better ensure the recovery of its fixed costs and margins despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather and other factors that affect customer usage 
the utility s income from off system sales remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
in conjunction with the settlement of the rate case  effective october   the utility retained all pre tax income from off system sales and capacity release revenues up to million annually 
pre tax amounts in excess of million were shared with customers  with the utility retaining of amounts exceeding that threshold 
the stipulation agreement approved by the mopsc in the utility s rate case increases the portion of pre tax income from off system sales and capacity release revenues that is shared with customers 
effective october   the utility is allowed to retain to of the first million in annual income earned depending on the level of income earned and of income exceeding million annually 
some of the factors impacting the level of off system sales include the availability and cost of the utility s natural gas supply  the weather in its service area  and the weather in other markets 
when laclede gas service area experiences warmer than normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints  some of the utility s natural gas supply is available for off system sales and there may be a demand for such supply in other markets 
laclede gas continues to work actively to reduce the impact of higher costs associated with wholesale natural gas prices by strategically structuring its natural gas supply portfolio and through the use of financial instruments 
nevertheless  the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
the utility s purchased gas adjustment pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including costs  cost reductions  and related carrying costs associated with the use of financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas  as well as gas inventory carrying costs 
the utility believes it will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply 
the generally higher price levels  relative to historical levels  may continue to affect sales volumes due to the conservation efforts of customers and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers 
laclede group continues to develop its other subsidiaries 
ler continues to focus on growing its markets on a long term and sustainable basis by providing both on system utility transportation customers and customers outside of laclede gas traditional service area with another choice in non regulated natural gas suppliers 
ler is working to assemble the team  technology  and resources necessary to expand its geographic service area and the range of services that it now provides 
nevertheless  income from ler s operations is subject to fluctuations in market conditions 
ler reported record earnings during fiscal year as a result of higher margins  caused by gulf coast market volatility  as well as higher wholesale sales volumes 
during fiscal  ler reported new record earnings  exceeding fiscal  primarily due to improved margins on sales of natural gas and higher wholesale sales volumes

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowances for doubtful accounts estimates of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable are based on historical trends  age of receivables  economic conditions  credit risk of specific customers  and other factors 
the utility s provision for uncollectible accounts is dependent on the regulatory treatment provided for such costs 
as approved by the mopsc  the utility was allowed to defer for future recovery uncollectible expenses associated with amendments to the cold weather rule for fiscal years and employee benefits and postretirement obligations pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events  such as discount rates  returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and mortality rates 
for the utility  the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs  as discussed further below 
certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims  portions of which are self insured and or contain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit exposure  are established based on historical trends

see note  pension plans and other postretirement benefits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the regulatory treatment of these costs 

table of contents regulated operations laclede gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
the provisions of sfas no 
require  among other things  that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators  where appropriate 
these actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non regulated enterprises 
when this occurs  costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet regulatory assets and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates 
also  regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of sfas no 
and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process 
management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of sfas no 
the utility s pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including the costs  cost reductions  and related carrying costs associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas 
the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the pga are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period 
the pga clause also authorizes the utility to recover costs it incurs to finance its investment in gas supplies that are purchased during the storage injection season for sale during the heating season 
the pga clause also permits the application of carrying costs to all over or under recoveries of gas costs  including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of financial instruments 
effective october   the pga clause also provides for a portion of income from off system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers 
the company records deferred tax liabilities and assets measured by enacted tax rates for the net tax effect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
changes in enacted tax rates  if any  and certain property basis differences will be reflected by entries to regulatory asset or regulatory liability accounts for regulated companies  and will be reflected as income or loss for non regulated companies 
pursuant to the direction of the mopsc  laclede gas provision for income tax expense for financial reporting purposes reflects an open ended method of tax depreciation 
laclede gas provision for income tax expense also records the income tax effect associated with the difference between overheads capitalized to construction for financial reporting purposes and those recognized for tax purposes without recording an offsetting deferred income tax expense 
these two methods are consistent with the regulatory treatment prescribed by the mopsc 
asset retirement obligations are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations are calculated using various assumptions related to the timing  method of settlement  inflation  and profit margins that third parties would demand to settle the future obligations 
these assumptions require the use of judgment and estimates and may change in future periods as circumstances dictate 
as authorized by the mopsc  laclede gas accrues future removal costs associated with its property  plant and equipment through its depreciation rates  even if a legal obligation does not exist as defined by sfas no 
and fin the difference between removal costs recognized in depreciation rates and the accretion expense and depreciation expense recognizable under sfas no 
and fin is a timing difference between the recovery of these costs in rates and their recognition for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  consistent with sfas no 
 these differences are deferred as regulatory liabilities 

table of contents the amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost recognized in the financial statements related to the utility s qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances  as approved by the mopsc  which have been established in the rate making process for the recovery of these costs from customers 
the differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans  but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost  be reflected in other comprehensive income 
for the utility s qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
for further discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included on page regulatory matters there have been several significant regulatory developments affecting laclede gas 
during fiscal  the mopsc approved permanent modifications to the cold weather rule affecting the disconnection and reconnection practices of utilities during the winter heating season 
those modifications included provisions to allow the utility to obtain accounting authorizations and defer for future recovery certain costs incurred with the modifications 
during fiscal  the utility deferred for future recovery million of costs associated with the fiscal heating season 
on october   the utility filed for determination and subsequent recovery of the deferred amount 
on november   the mopsc directed the mopsc staff and the missouri office of public counsel public counsel to submit their positions regarding the utility s filing by february  on february   the utility and the mopsc staff filed a non unanimous stipulation agreement in which these parties agreed to a recovery of million of costs 
the non unanimous stipulation agreement was opposed by public counsel  and a hearing in this matter was held before the commission on march  on april   the commission issued its report and order approving the million cost recovery recommended by the utility and the mopsc staff 
consistent with the approved amount  the utility recorded a reduction in its deferral totaling million during the quarter ended march  on may   public counsel appealed the mopsc s april order to the cole county  missouri circuit court 
laclede gas believes that public counsel s appeal is without merit and is vigorously opposing the appeal 
on november   the utility made an isrs filing with the commission designed to increase revenues by million annually 
on january   the commission approved implementation of the surcharge to be effective january  on april   the utility made an isrs filing with the commission designed to increase revenues by million annually 
on june   the commission approved implementation of the surcharge in the full amount requested  effective june  on december   the mopsc staff proposed a disallowance of million related to laclede gas recovery of its purchased gas costs applicable to fiscal on september   the staff withdrew its pursuit of million of the disallowance it had originally proposed 
laclede gas believes that the remaining million of the mopsc staff s proposed disallowance lacks merit and is vigorously opposing the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc 
on december   the mopsc staff proposed a disallowance of million related to laclede gas recovery of its purchased gas costs applicable to fiscal laclede gas believes that the mopsc staff s position lacks merit and is vigorously opposing the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc 
in addition  the mopsc s staff raised questions regarding whether certain sales and capacity release transactions  subject to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc s oversight  were consistent with the ferc s regulations and policies regarding capacity release 
the company commenced an internal review of the questions raised by the mopsc staff and notified the ferc staff that it took this action 
subsequently  as a result of the internal review  the company has provided the ferc staff with a report regarding compliance of sales and capacity release activities with the ferc s regulations and policies 
on july   the ferc staff requested additional information  which the company provided on august  and september  
table of contents on july   laclede gas made a tariff filing with the mopsc that would make the payment provisions for the restoration of gas service under the utility s cold weather rule available to customers in the summer of and enable the utility to increase or decrease its pga rates to correct for any shortfall or surplus created by the difference between the gas cost portion of the utility s actual net bad debt write offs and the amount of such cost that is embedded in its existing rates 
the mopsc suspended the tariff on august  and established a procedural schedule to consider the utility s filing 
hearings are scheduled for december  as a result  the cold weather rule portion of the filing is now moot  but the remainder of the filing is pending before the mopsc 
accounting pronouncements the company has evaluated or is in the process of evaluating the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on the company s financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
for disclosures related to the adoption of new accounting standards  see the new accounting standards section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions  regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business of laclede gas  the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant 
rate regulation  to which laclede gas is subject  allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation 
while no plans exist to undertake replacements of plant in service other than normal replacements and those under existing replacement programs  laclede gas believes that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities would be recovered through the normal regulatory process 
credit ratings current credit ratings for laclede group and laclede gas issues are as follows type of facility s p moody s fitch laclede group issuer rating a a laclede gas first mortgage bonds a a a laclede gas commercial paper a p f the company has investment grade ratings and believes that it will have adequate access to the financial markets to meet its capital requirements 
these ratings remain subject to review and change by the rating agencies 
cash flows the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when laclede gas borrows money to cover the lag between when it purchases its natural gas and when its customers pay for that gas 
changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas including cash payments for margin deposits associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments  variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the utility s pga clause  and the utilization of storage gas inventories cause short term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year  and can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal year was million 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal year the year to year variations are primarily attributable to the timing of the utility s cash receipts and payments related to accounts payable  accounts receivable  deferred purchased gas cost including variations in cash payments for margin deposits associated with the use of natural gas financial instruments  and the cost of natural gas storage inventories  all of which were impacted by year to year changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal year net cash used in investing activities for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year is primarily attributable to the proceeds from the sale of sm p  partially offset by capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years and primarily reflected capital expenditures and an acquisition by sm p in fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year the variation in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily attributable to the redemption of the company s long term debt to an unconsolidated affiliate trust and the maturity of long term debt  partially offset by the issuance of additional long term debt 
the company used a portion of the proceeds from the aforementioned sale of sm p to fund the redemption of the long term debt to the unconsolidated affiliate trust 
the variation in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year compared with net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the level of short term debt required in each year as a result of fluctuations in cash provided by operating activities associated with the effect of changes in natural gas prices described previously 
liquidity and capital resources short term debt as indicated above  the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during the colder months 
these short term cash requirements have traditionally been met through the sale of commercial paper supported by lines of credit with banks 
laclede gas has a line of credit in place of million from banks  with the largest portion provided by a single bank being 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the expiration of this line was extended one year to december from december in november  the utility established a seasonal line of credit of million  which expired in march subsequent to the end of fiscal year  laclede gas established a seasonal line of credit of million  which will expire in march including both lines of credit  the largest portion provided by a single bank is 
due to unfavorable terms in the commercial paper markets near the end of fiscal year  laclede gas utilized its line of credit as a more economical source of short term financing 
short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million  while outstanding bank line advances were million 
the weighted average interest rate on these short term borrowings was per annum at september  based on total short term borrowings at september   a change in interest rate of basis points would increase or decrease pre tax earnings and cash flows of laclede group by approximately million on an annual basis 
portions of such increases or decreases may be offset through the application of pga carrying costs 
in addition  laclede gas had borrowings from laclede group totaling million at september  the utility had short term borrowings including borrowings from laclede group aggregating to a maximum of million at any one time during the fiscal year 
excluding borrowings from laclede group  the utility s maximum borrowings for the year were million 
laclede gas lines of credit include covenants limiting total debt  including short term debt  to no more than of total capitalization and requiring earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to be at least times interest expense 
on september   total debt was of total capitalization 
for the fiscal year ended september   ebitda was times interest expense 
short term cash requirements outside of laclede gas have generally been met with internally generated funds 
however  laclede group has million in working capital lines of credit  million of which expires in august and million of which expires in october  to meet short term liquidity needs of its subsidiaries 
these lines of credit have covenants limiting the total debt of the consolidated laclede group to no more than of the company s total capitalization 
this ratio stood at on september  these lines were previously used to provide letters of credit on behalf of sm p  and have been used to provide for seasonal funding needs of various other subsidiaries from time to time 
just prior to the sm p sale  the letters of credit provided on behalf of sm p totaled million 
such letters have been released and extinguished 
there were no borrowings under laclede group s lines during the fiscal year

while these long term debt issues are fixed rate  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
however  increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if laclede gas were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity
