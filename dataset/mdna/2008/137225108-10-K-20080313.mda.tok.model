item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
qualifying statement with respect to forward looking information and risks the following information contains forward looking information 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements above and forward looking statements below 
our activities and investments in our common stock involve a high degree of risk 
each of the risks in item a risk factors may have a significant impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 
general we are an independent energy company engaged in operations located primarily in countries comprising the former soviet union involving the acquisition  exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
our principal means of growth has been through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing oil and gas properties by means of entering into production sharing arrangements and licence arrangements with governmental or local oil companies 
as a result of our historical exploration and acquisition activities  we believe that we have a substantial inventory of exploitation and development opportunities  the successful completion of which is critical to the maintenance and growth of our current production levels 
we have incurred net losses in the last five years  and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the following factors which most significantly affect our results of operations the sales prices of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  
table of contents the level of total sales volumes of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  the availability of  and our ability to raise additional  capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
reserves and production volumes year end gross total proved oil reserves at the ninotsminda field were mmbbl down from s mmbbl 
over the same period  gross total proved natural gas reserves from the ninotsminda field in georgia were bcf down from s bcf 
the reduction in our proved oil reserves was primarily the result of our unsuccessful completion of the work over of the n well in the eastern part of the ninotisminda field and our failure to implement other planned operations during the year 
this resulted in a reduction in total proved undeveloped reserves of  bbls 
the remaining proved undeveloped reserves of  bbls could face further impairment if the n well we have budgeted in is unsuccessful or in the event we are unable to fund those expenditures 
because our proved reserves will decline as crude oil and natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced  unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation and development projects 
exploitation and development activity ninotsminda following the rehabilitation and development work undertaken on the ninotsminda field  we realised that the performance of wells was being negatively impacted by being drilled over balanced with conventional drilling methods and we decided to employ under balanced drilling technology in order to maximise productivity and recoverability from the field 
it was planned that future horizontal wells on the field should be drilled using this technology 
in june  we signed a contract with weus holding inc  a subsidiary of weatherford international ltd weatherford  for the supply of under balanced coiled tubing drilling ubctd services to our projects in georgia 
under the terms of the contract  weatherford were to supply and operate an ubctd unit to be used on a program of up to horizontal well bores on our ninotsminda and samgori fields we were party to the samgori psc at this time 
elsewhere in the oil industry  the use of under balanced drilling techniques has been shown to result in significantly less formation damage  resulting in higher sustained production rates and ultimate recovery 
at the same time  utilisation of coiled tubing drilling gives greater flexibility in the drilling process and in the control of the horizontal section 
it was considered that these combined drilling technologies would provide the best way to develop and produce both the ninotsminda and samgori fields 
we planned to drill at least five under balanced horizontal sidetracks on the ninotsminda field and ubctd operations started on the first well in the program  the nh well  in december  but due to technical problems with the equipment the under balanced drilling was not completed until late february and then only with a much shorter than planned section being drilled  and the well not achieving its objective  despite flowing gas at reported high rates through the gas cap section 
subsequent operations by weatherford on both nh and nh wells also proved unsuccessful  with weatherford failing to drill any horizontal section in these wells 
progress was hampered by multiple failures of the downhole motors  other equipment malfunctions and the loss of bottom hole assemblies in the wells 
following the failure of weatherford to successfully complete any horizontal sidetrack development wells on the ninotsminda field using ubctd technology  weatherford demobilized its equipment and left georgia in july despite this lack of success  which we attribute mainly to multiple equipment failures  we still believe that under balanced technology is an appropriate technology for the development of this type of reservoir 
however  as we withdrew from the samgori psc in february  it would be prohibitively expensive to mobilise an ubctd unit to georgia solely for a drilling campaign on the ninotsminda field and we are considering other ways in which to most efficiently produce the remaining reserves of the field 
in the meantime  we have continued with our jointed pipe drilling operations using our own rigs and equipment and the directional drilling services of baker hughes international to drill horizontal sidetrack wells on the ninotsminda field 
in october we completed the nh sidetrack which tested at a rate of up to mmcf mcm of gas per day plus barrels of condensate per day a total of  barrels oil 
table of contents equivalent on a inch mm choke with a flowing tubing head pressure fthp of atmospheres  psig 
the well is currently producing at a steady rate of approximately mmcf mcm of gas per day and barrels of oil per day bopd 
the latest horizontal sidetrack well to be drilled on the field was the nh well which we completed in march it targeted oil volumes un drained from previous offset area wells and was put on production test following the installation of a slotted liner over a  feet metres interval furthest from the heel of the well 
the well produced initially with a high water cut  approximately  and an oil rate which peaked at barrels of oil per day bopd before declining 
subsequent pressure surveys run with downhole gauges suggested that the nh well was in communication with the offset nh well 
the most likely assumed scenario was then some of the fracture sets encountered at the end of the nh well were drained by the nh well and were hence water filled 
once a very high permeability connection is established with the aquifer  water will flow in preference to any oil filled fractures or matrix of lower permeability 
on the basis of the test data and due to the fact that the nh well is approximately feet metres structurally higher than the nh well which is still producing oil  we decided to attempt to conduct remedial water isolation 
the slotted liner deployed in the horizontal section limited mechanical options for shutting off the toe end of the horizontal section 
previous experience in the field has shown that pulling a liner once set has a very low chance of success due to formation collapse around the liner 
also  a traditional cement isolation was considered to have a low chance of success in a horizontal section  so we opted for a coiled tubing deployed chemical shut off 
water isolation operations have been performed but subsequent production testing showed that the treatment was not successful 
we plan to set a cement retainer in the solid liner section of the nh well in order to isolate and abandon the slotted liner part and then perforate the liner in the build up and heel section of the well where there is potential to re complete this well as a gas producer 
this operation will be subject to having a suitable gas off take agreement in place 
our only reliable gas sales to date from the ninotsminda field were during the winter seasons of and when we supplied gas to aes gardabani a subsidiary of aes corporation who operated a number of units at the gardabani thermal power plant in eastern georgia at that time 
gas sales since then have been erratic and payment has been unreliable 
in june  our subsidiary company  ninotsminda oil company limited noc concluded a gas sales agreement with the state of georgia for the sale of gas to the state run power units at gardabani once the state had completed repairs to the mile kilometres pipeline between ninotsminda and gardabani 
the initial planned quantity of gas to be supplied under the agreement was up to mmscf mcm per day with initial delivery expected in the fall of however  due to the pipeline being much more extensively damaged than originally anticipated and issues over the commingling of gas  the state decided not to proceed with these repairs 
as an alternative  the state proposed to connect the region of georgia within which the ninotsminda field is located to the georgian domestic gas grid 
this work was completed in february and may eventually provide noc with an alternative market for its gas production with potential for higher prices and regular sales 
for the past couple of years  noc has supplied the gas produced from the ninotsminda field mainly associated gas at a low price to local villages as part of a social program rather than flare this gas 
despite the price being approximately per mcf per mcm there is a significant outstanding debt to noc for gas supplied 
it was not possible for the company to terminate supply in order to force payment as these villages did not have access to an alternative supply of gas 
with the connection of these areas to the domestic gas grid  both noc and georgian oil and gas corporation gogc  who is also the state representative in the production sharing contract and sells its share of the gas together with noc  believe that we are now in a better position to enforce payment and commercialise gas sales 
following the completion of the gas connection  the existing gas sales agreement between noc  gogc and the local gas supply company has been amended to increase the price for gas to an average of approximately per mcf per mcm 
the new price is based on a quantity of gas being set aside for domestic household consumption at per mcf per mcm with the balance supplied to the gas distribution company at per mcf per mcm 
the amendment is effective from february  using  cubic feet of gas equals barrel of oil condensate 
table of contents and the gross quantity of gas to be supplied under the agreement is approximately mmcf mcm per day 
at present  the local gas distribution companies are state entities  but plans are in place to privatize all gas distribution companies in the near future 
this is also expected to help with the payment for gas 
in an attempt to increase production at the field in  we continued to perform workover operations on the n well using our own rig and crew to extract a complex fish approximately  feet  metres comprising drill pipe  tubing and a milling assembly from the well 
n  which is a soviet era well  has never produced from the reservoir due to the fish with the well subsequently being abandoned 
the fishing operation was further complicated due to the inclined nature of the well which has a number of severe dog legs and the potential for the tubing to have deformed when dropped 
although the operation was always considered to present a considerable technical challenge  we did succeed in recovering approximately  feet  metres of and tubing 
however  we have now reached the pulling capacity of rig and are unable to progress further with this unit 
we are re evaluating the operation and if we deem the chances of success to be reasonable  we will consider moving our larger rig to the site once it has completed operations on manavi 
further to an ongoing technical re evaluation of the field  we believe that there are significant potential reserves remaining both within and surrounding the main field area and we are working on a production enhancement strategy to increase the level of production subject to financing being available 
such production enhancement strategy might include drilling a new well into the undeveloped eastern part of the field 
this would be a highly deviated well from the vicinity of the nh surface location with up to two horizontal sections being completed in the middle eocene reservoir interval 
the eastern part of the ninotsminda field has not been exploited because most of the area falls within an environmental protection zone where drilling is prohibited 
the n horizontal well is the most easterly producing well on the field and  although not oriented in an optimal direction so as to best encounter the sub vertical fractures which are important for production  the well has produced approximately  barrels of oil to date and continues to produce at a steady rate of approximately barrels of oil per day bopd with less than water cut 
more optimally oriented horizontal wells such as nh and nh initially tested at rates of approximately  bopd 
the use of new technology such as radial drilling to produce trapped oil from shallower reservoirs overlying the main middle eocene reservoir 
previous attempts to produce these zones using perforations were largely unsuccessful due to near well bore reservoir damage caused by unsuitable drilling fluids used in soviet times 
we believe that radial drilling could have the ability to reach beyond this damage and we are currently in discussion with a service provider both on the suitability and availability of this technology 
general workover activity such as the application of perforations to unproduced reservoir intervals and the use of water isolation techniques to suppress water flow and increase oil production 
following the completion of testing operations at m  consideration may be given to mobilising canargo rig to the n well to complete the fishing operation  add perforations to the reservoir interval and  if successful  put the well into production 
on the northern flank of the ninotsminda field is a potentially large accumulation of oil in the oligocene interval which has been established by the n well 
this well  drilled several years ago  initially tested oil at a rate of  bopd  but never produced at this high rate due to the incursion of water due to what is believed to be a poor cement bond behind the casing 
a new vertical well to the west of n is being considered in order to better exploit this accumulation 
if crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices return to depressed levels or if our production from our development program does not deliver a significant production increase  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected

table of contents exploration and appraisal manavi the first exploration well drilled on the manavi structure  manavi m  reached a total depth td of  feet  metres in the cretaceous in september the well encountered the cretaceous limestone target at  feet  metres with over feet metres of hydrocarbons indicated on wireline logs and with no evidence of an oil water contact present 
on test the m well flowed light sweet api oil at a visibly significant rate and at a high pressure prior to the test being terminated due to the mechanical failure of the production tubing 
oil was also discovered in the shallower middle eocene sequence  but was not tested 
attempts to recover the damaged tubing from the m well were unsuccessful 
the well was prepared and subsequently sidetracked using a saipem spa saipem ideco e az drilling rig equipped with a top drive drilling system and an oil based mud system provided by baker hughes international baker to control the swelling clays which had proved difficult to drill in the original well 
the manavi mz well reached a td of  feet  metres in the cretaceous in october the well was completed in the cretaceous using slim hole drilling technology due to the small size of the casing from which the well was sidetracked 
the primary cretaceous limestone target was encountered at  feet  metres some feet metres higher than in the original m well while the secondary middle eocene target zone was penetrated at  feet  metres again significantly higher than in the m well 
the carbonate section itself was proven to be approximately feet metres thick 
drilling data and slim hole wireline logs indicated the presence of hydrocarbons in both the cretaceous and middle eocene target zones 
again no oil water contact was identified 
as initial flow testing only produced small amounts of oil and gas  it quickly became apparent that the reservoir needed to be stimulated in order to properly complete the testing operation 
considering the small diameter of the hole which would limit our ability to optimally test this well  and the fact that the specialist equipment required for this job is both difficult to source and expensive to mobilise for a single operation  we decided to delay completion of this test until after the completion of the planned m appraisal well 
the m well is located approximately miles km to the west of the original discovery well 
this well was drilled using the saipem rig and an oil based mud capability with baker providing mud engineering services 
oil based mud was used in an attempt to control the swelling clays above the target horizon which had proved difficult to drill in the original well 
a td of  feet  metres was reached in mid december with a total thickness of  feet metres of cretaceous carbonates and volcanics having been encountered 
the significant hydrocarbon shows observed during the drilling process and the data obtained from wireline logs indicated a potentially significant hydrocarbon column in the well with no obvious presence of a hydrocarbon water contact 
prior to testing the well  an feet metre pre perforated production liner was run over the potential reservoir interval and a production testing string set to test the cretaceous carbonate and interbedded units 
during setting of the test string  the well began flowing and it was necessary to increase the mud weight to control the well whilst the test string was set 
despite the flow and gas observed at surface during drilling operations  the initial testing operations resulted in a pressure increase at surface but with no discernable flow 
subsequent re perforating of parts of the test interval has resulted in minor flow with gas being flared and black o api oil collected at surface 
however it is considered likely that formation damage has occurred  probably whilst controlling the well during the setting of the test string  with mud penetrating and blocking the formation 
we concluded that stimulation techniques using acid to clean the well and create conductive pathways from the reservoir to the well bore and hence bypass any reservoir damage would be required to fully production test the potential of the well 
acid stimulation is a fairly common procedure required to stimulate flow in carbonate reservoirs of the same age in the north caucasus and indeed elsewhere 
however  prior to going to the expense of mobilizing a full acid fracturing spread  it was decided first to conduct a simple acid wash to ensure the effectiveness of acid stimulation under the reservoir conditions encountered in m fractech ltd  a uk company providing independent well completion and stimulation laboratory testing  design and consultancy 
table of contents services  and schlumberger well completions experts provided advice on the chemicals and the stimulation program 
the stimulation itself was performed through coiled tubing over a foot metres interval consisting primarily of cretaceous limestone where the best hydrocarbon shows were observed during drilling 
on stimulation  involving a low pressure acid squeeze  the well flowed back unaided and produced liquids at rates of up to barrels per hour  barrels per day and a sizeable gas flare 
over a hour period  the well produced a total of barrels of liquids consisting of pumped fluid and chemicals  polymer drilling mud released from the reservoir  oil and gas 
the maximum oil cut observed was in excess of 
the well  however  did not sustain flow  and it was concluded that the extent of the formation damage was beyond that which could be cleaned using a simple acid stimulation process  and as such a proper hydraulic fracturing of the formation with acid was required 
the results of the initial treatment suggested that acid was the correct approach to opening this formation up to flow while at the same time proving the presence of oil in the reservoir 
on august  we announced that schlumberger had been contracted to provide pumping equipment  chemicals and services to the company in order to perform a hydraulic acid fracturing treatment of the cretaceous reservoir interval in the manavi well 
in order to prepare the well for the fracture stimulation  our operating company  canargo georgia  replaced the inch production string with a inch fraccing string  and set a temporary plug to reduce the treatment interval  in order to give the operation the best chance of success 
on january  we announced that the acid fracturing operation at the manavi well had been successfully completed by schlumberger 
the acid fracturing stimulation was conducted using a multi stage treatment comprising the pumping of a fracture initiating gel followed by hydrochloric acid stimulating fluids and diverter agents 
this process was repeated a number of times for maximum efficiency 
approximately  barrels of treatment fluids were pumped at a maximum rate of up to barrels per minute 
an interval totalling feet metres across the cretaceous carbonate reservoir section in the well from  feet  metres to  feet  metres was isolated for the treatment 
pressure readings recorded during the operation indicate that fractures were successfully created 
following the fracturing operation  the well commenced to flow unaided with spent acid and chemicals being flowed to a surface pit 
during this time  the effectiveness of the fracture stimulation in opening the reservoir up to flow and the potential deliverability of the reservoir itself was demonstrated by the flow back rate which reached a maximum flow back of barrels per hour  barrels per day 
however  despite the initial encouraging oil and gas shows to foot to metre gas flare observed during the flow back or clean up phase  the oil cut did not exceed of the total flow from the well following the clean up process 
it would appear that the well was producing excess water  but without further testing and data collection it has not to date been possible to ascertain where this water was coming from 
as part of the planned testing program  it is intended to run a production long in the well to determine the origin of this water 
in order to proceed with the testing program  it was necessary to replace the inch frac string required for the stimulation operation with inch production grade tubing 
attempts to set a blanking plug in the lower completion in the well to isolate the reservoir interval using coil tubing were abandoned following a mechanical failure of the injector head on the coil tubing unit causing damage to the coil tubing  plug and upper completion string 
a wireline unit was mobilised from baku to reset the plug 
this was successfully completed  but on extraction of the frac string by canargo georgia it became apparent that damage had also been caused to the completion which resulted in a modification to the final well completion being required 
the production tubing is now in place and pressure tested  however  operations to retrieve the mechanical plug have encountered further complications and additional equipment will need to be mobilised to georgia to complete the operation 
once the plug is removed  well testing operations will continue 
as part of the planned testing program  a wireline conveyed production logging tool will be run in the well to help locate fluid entry points to the well and provide downhole flow rate and pressure data during the test 
this data will assist in the evaluation of well conditions and reservoir performance and help assess the overall potential of the well 
in order to fully evaluate the potential of the manavi prospect as a whole  significant additional drilling and analysis will be required as part of this analysis  we are also evaluating the technical feasibility of acquiring a d seismic data survey over the manavi structure 
all these exploratory activities are  however  dependent upon the company securing additional funding 
if commercial production can be established at m  the well would be put into longterm test production and 
table of contents consideration would be given to performing a similar acid fracture stimulation of the mz well which remains suspended 
norio the second phase of the preliminary work program under the norio psa commenced in january when the first exploration well named mk was spudded on the norio prospect using the canargo ural mash rig 
norio is a large prospect identified at middle eocene level and is analogous in size to the nearby samgori and ninotsminda field complex immediately to the south and east of the block 
it has been reported that the samgori oil field alone has produced approximately million barrels of oil to date 
completion of the mk well was delayed as a result of technical problems encountered whilst drilling  and the need to farm out a portion of the equity in the block in order to partly fund the drilling 
in september  cnl signed a farm in agreement relating to the norio psa with a wholly owned subsidiary of georgian oil  the georgian state oil company 
this farm in agreement obligated georgian oil to pay up to million to deepen  to a planned depth of  feet  metres  the mk well in return for a interest in the contractor share of the norio psa 
georgian oil also had an option  exercisable for a limited period after completion of the well  to increase its interest to of the contractor share of the norio psa on payment to cnl of million 
due to georgian oil s inability to continue to fund the drilling of the well  operations were subsequently suspended and only resumed after may when we repaid to georgian oil the investment it had made in the mk well to terminate the farm in agreement and option and secure a working interest in the norio psa 
in august the saipem drilling rig and baker oil based mud system was mobilized to the mk exploration well as our ural mash rig had difficulty drilling through a highly over pressured section of swelling clays above the prognosed target zone 
on december   we announced that the mk well reached a depth of  feet  metres in the middle eocene reservoir having encountered very good oil and gas shows 
before the well could be drilled to the planned depth and tested  the bottom hole assembly bha became stuck due to hole collapse 
subsequent attempts to retrieve the bha were not successful and we decided to abandon the lower target due to a limited chance of sidetracking the well at this depth in a small diameter hole and to focus our attention on the shallower oil discovery in the overlying oligocene sands which were the secondary target for the well 
from the data obtained from the middle eocene the primary target for the well we believe that an oil discovery has been made at this level  and that the reservoir has exhibited both permeability and the presence of movable light oil 
as such  even though the middle eocene has not been fully evaluated  the mk well has encountered the middle eocene reservoir on prognosis  and with hydrocarbons thus achieving many of the objectives of this wildcat exploration well 
a comprehensive testing program on the oil bearing oligocene sandstones encountered in the norio mk well commenced in mid march when a total of feet metres of net sands were perforated over the interval  feet  metres to  feet  metres 
these sands had good oil shows whilst drilling  with oil to surface and with hydrocarbons being interpreted on the electric logs which also indicated a substantial thickness of net pay sands 
following an extensive testing program  the well sustained flow on a small choke size with low average gross fluid rates of approximately barrels per day consisting of light api oil  gas and water 
a number of surge clean up flows  a re perforation of selected intervals  and a low pressure hydrofrac using our own pumping unit have been attempted but these have not improved reservoir deliverability 
it is believed that the current flow is limited to a thinner  less permeable  interval whilst the better quality reservoir remains isolated due to potential reservoir damage caused by the invasive fluid damage of the drilling mud 
the lower zones in the well  which would have been in communication with the oligocene interval through the well bore  were drilled with a to specific gravity sg mud due to anticipated reservoir pressures while the results from the testing program indicate that the mid interval reservoir pressure for the oligocene whilst still over pressured  is lower at sg equivalent 
as a result of possible mud damage  the current perforations may have not penetrated deep enough beyond the damaged zone to allow proper communication between the more permeable formations and the well bore 

table of contents we considered mobilising a more powerful fraccing unit and equipment to georgia in order to pump a propant and fluid into the well at high pressure and volume  but the potential for this technology is limited due to a lack of a cement bond behind the casing and the large interval which has been perforated 
the well has been left on test production for the past several months but there has been no discernable increase in gross fluid production rate 
as we would appear to have exhausted all the low cost options available to us at this time to bypass any damage that may exist in the near well bore area and establish better communication between the well bore and the reservoir  we believe that the only effective option remaining is to sidetrack the well or to drill a new well 
the latter  of course  would enable us to attempt to test both the oligocene and middle eocene intervals both of which are considered to have significantly reduced geological risk 
we plan  subject to financing being available from internal resources or through a farm out arrangement  to drill an appraisal well to fully evaluate these attractive discoveries  with the well being designed to enter the middle eocene reservoir with a larger hole size 
in  several companies undertook a technical review of the norio area and a number of these have expressed an interest in further evaluating a farm in to this acreage 
we will continue to progress our negotiations with potential farm in partners 
kumisi following an undertaking by the government to purchase any gas produced from the kumisi prospect on agreed commercial terms  we drilled a well to appraise this prospect in up dip of the wr well 
the kumisi well is located within the nazvrevi psc area and is approximately miles km southeast of tbilisi 
it is close to the domestic gas transportation grid and the route of the new south caucasus gas trunkline from azerbaijan to turkey 
the well commenced drilling in february and reached a total depth of  feet  metres in june in the cretaceous 
an extensive testing program was conducted over the cretaceous section where six separate intervals totalling feet metres were perforated and tested 
despite elevated gas readings being recorded during drilling  these tests resulted in no discernable flow from the formation and without any hydrocarbons being detected 
it is  therefore  reasonable to assume that the cretaceous reservoir at this location is tight unlike the rocks encountered in other wells in the area 
this conclusion was confirmed by a low pressure hydro squeeze which was performed over two separate zones with the data obtained suggesting that these rocks are tight and lack permeability 
further tests were carried out of potential reservoir units in the overlying middle and lower eocene sequences 
three separate tests were conducted with a total of feet metres of sandstones being perforated and flow tested 
these tests produced water with gas flow to surface in flareable quantities  but non commercial volumes 
each interval was flow tested for a number of days over which there was no increase in the amount of gas produced and the testing was subsequently terminated 
on october  we announced that the kumisi was being plugged and abandoned 
the well results  particularly for the cretaceous interval  will be reviewed and incorporated into our technical evaluation of the area in order to fully understand the remaining potential of the kumisi area 
as part of this analysis  consideration will be given to acid fracture stimulation techniques as a means by which to enhance permeability within the prospect 
as no water has been recovered from the well  management believes that potential for a large gas prospect may still exist up dip of the wr well given better reservoir quality 
in  we have budgeted approximately million for our exploration and appraisal work in georgia  primarily for the testing and appraisal of the manavi discovery and a short term production enhancement program at the ninotsminda field subject to available financing 
to pursue existing projects beyond our immediate development plan and to pursue new opportunities  we will require additional capital 
while expected to be substantial  without further exploration work and evaluation the exact amount of funds needed to fully develop all of our oil and gas properties cannot at present be quantified 
potential sources of funds include additional sales of equity securities  project financing  debt financing subject to certain restrictions under our convertible loan agreements and the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects 
although we have been successful in the past in raising capital there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing the necessary funding or if such funding is available that it 
table of contents will be offered on attractive or acceptable terms 
should such funding not be forthcoming and we are unable to sell some or all of our non core assets  or  if sold  such sales realize insufficient proceeds  we may have to delay or abandon such projects 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
full development of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require the availability of substantial additional financing from external sources 
we may also  where opportunities exist  seek to transfer portions of our interests in oil and gas properties and ventures to entities in exchange for such financing 
we generally have the principal responsibility for arranging financing for the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have an interest 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or the entities that are developing the oil and gas properties and ventures will be able to arrange the financing necessary to develop the projects being undertaken or to support our corporate and other activities 
there can also be no assurance that such financing as is available will be on terms that are attractive or acceptable to or are deemed to be in the best interest of canargo  such entities and their respective stockholders or participants 
ultimate realization of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to us 
establishment of successful oil and gas operations is dependent upon  among other factors  the following mobilization of equipment and personnel to implement effectively drilling  completion and production activities  raising of additional capital  achieving significant production at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation  or economic arrangements in lieu of taxation in host countries  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
subject to our ability to raise additional capital  we have plans to mobilize resources and achieve levels of production and profits sufficient to recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
however  if one or more of the above factors  or other factors  are different than anticipated  these plans may not be realized  and we may not recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
commencing in september through june an aggregate of  million in indebtedness under the company s subordinated notes and the subordinated notes collectively  the notes will come due and be payable 
unless such notes are converted into shares of common stock in accordance with their respective terms  the company will be required to repay or refinance such outstanding indebtedness 
there can be no assurance at this time that company will have the resources to repay such notes or if it will be in a position to refinance such indebtedness 
repayment of the notes has been guaranteed by various subsidiaries of the company which hold substantially all of the assets of the company on a consolidated basis 
availability of capital as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  project financing  debt financing subject to certain restrictions under our convertible loan agreements  the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects  and the proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities although no assurances can be made that we will be successful in any such efforts 
as of march   the company had an aggregate of  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and  authorized shares of common stock 
during  we issued  shares of our common stock of which  shares were in connection with the exercise of warrants   shares were in connection with exercise of stock options and  shares were in connection with a private placement 
during  we have to date issued no shares of our common stock 
as of march   an aggregate of  shares are reserved for issuance under various stock option plans  warrants and other contractual commitments  including the senior secured notes  the subordinated notes and the subordinated note 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general we currently have sufficient cash on hand to support our operations through to the third quarter in order to fund our planned capital expenditure program and to continue our operations after the third quarter  we need to raise substantial funds 
as noted elsewhere we are pursuing raising additional funds through private placements of our equity or debt securities or a possible rights offering to shareholders 
we are also actively pursuing the farming out a number of our exploration projects 
we are required under the covenants of our existing convertible notes to obtain the approval of a majority of our debt holders in order to incur additional indebtedness in excess of million  which approval we cannot guarantee 
in the event we attempt to raise funds through an equity offering  we would more than likely be required to offer our equity securities at a substantial discount to the current public market price in order to attract investors 
in the event that we were to do so  provisions in our outstanding convertible notes and warrants would cause their exercise prices to reset to the lower price in any offering 
if low enough  this could effect a significant dilution to current shareholders or possibly to a change of control event 
there can be no assurance of our success in raising these funds 
in the event that we are unable to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  we will be required to significantly curtail our operations in georgia and to abandon our currently planned capital expenditure program 
the crude oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our current capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to fund the following costs the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  and acquisition of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties 
the amount of capital available to us will affect our ability to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties and  possibly  our ability to service any future debt obligations  if any 
our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  project financing  debt financing  the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects  and the sale of certain assets 
our overall liquidity depends heavily on the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas and our production volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
we do not hedge our crude oil production 
accordingly  future crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results and therefore our liquidity 
low crude oil and natural gas prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us and could also reduce our ability to borrow in the future 
if the volume of crude oil we produce decreases  our cash flow from operations will decrease 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
we sold properties in and which reduced potential future reserves and  in the future  we may sell additional properties and other assets  which could further reduce our production volumes and income from oil well drilling and servicing 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional producing properties as we did with our acquisition of a interest in the samgori field in or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
should our current exploration  exploitation and development wells in georgia prove unsuccessful and we were unable to raise additional debt or equity finance  we might have to cut back on our capital spending plans and or modify our operating plans to conserve cash 
as of december   we had working capital of  compared to working capital of  as of december  the  decrease in working capital from december  to december  is principally due to expenditures in the period to fund the cost of development activities at the ninotsminda field  our appraisal activities at the manavi oil discovery and the kumisi appraisal well in georgia and net cash used by operating activities partially offset by cash received pursuant to a private placement and the maturing of a deposit previously recorded as restricted cash

to pursue existing projects for our immediate appraisal and development plans  pay operating expenses and to pursue new opportunities  we will require additional capital in while expected to be substantial  without further exploration work and evaluation the exact amount of funds needed to fully develop all of our oil and gas properties cannot at present  be quantified 
potential sources of funds include additional sales of equity securities  project financing  debt financing and the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects 
based on our past history of raising capital and continuing discussions  we believe that such required funds may be available 
however  there is no assurance that such funds will be available  and if available  will be offered on attractive or acceptable terms 
should such funding not be forthcoming  we may not be able to pursue projects beyond our current appraisal and development plans or to pursue new opportunities 
as discussed above  under the terms of the notes  we are restricted from incurring additional indebtedness 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
full development of our oil and gas properties and ventures may require the availability of substantial additional financing from external sources 
we may also  where opportunities exist  seek to transfer portions of our interests in oil and gas properties and ventures to entities in exchange for such financing 
we generally have the principal responsibility for arranging financing for the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have an interest 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or the entities that are developing the oil and gas properties and ventures will be able to arrange the financing necessary to develop the projects being undertaken or to support the corporate and other activities of canargo 
there can also be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms that are attractive or acceptable to or are deemed to be in the best interest of canargo  such entities and their respective stockholders or participants 
ultimate realization of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to canargo 
establishment of successful oil and gas operations is dependent upon  among other factors  the following mobilization of equipment and personnel to implement effectively drilling  completion and production activities  
table of contents raising of additional capital  achieving significant production at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation  or economic arrangements in lieu of taxation in host countries  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
subject to our ability to raise additional capital  we have plans to mobilize resources and achieve levels of production and profits sufficient to recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
however  if one or more of the above factors  or other factors  are different than anticipated  these plans may not be realized  and we may not recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures

we currently have a contingent planned minimum capital expenditure budget of million subject to financing being available for  all of which is allocated to our georgian development and appraisal projects 
during  we plan to participate in the workover of two wells on the ninotsminda field and complete the testing of the manavi appraisal well  m further drilling at norio will be subject to securing financing for this project which may be by way of a farm out of part of our interest in the psa in exchange for the drilling of an appraisal well 
we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on the results of our development and appraisal programs  market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of crude oil and natural gas decline from current levels  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset crude oil and natural gas production volume decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties

on february  we issued a press release announcing that our subsidiary  csl  was not proceeding with further investment in the samgori block xi b production sharing contract samgori psc in georgia and associated farm in which became effective in april  and accordingly we terminated our interest in the samgori psc with effect from february  the net loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes for the year ended december  of  compares to an income of  for the year ended december  due to the activities of tethys and csl 
csl generated  of oil and gas revenue in the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  primarily due to a higher average net sales price achieved in the year ended december  offset by lower sales volumes 
its net share of the  bbls bopd of gross oil production for sale from the samgori field in the period up to february   the date of withdrawal  amounted to  bbls 
in the period   bbls of oil were added to storage

table of contents averaged per barrel as compared with an average of per barrel for the year ended december  tethys recorded a loss from operations of  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increased loss in is mainly attributable to consolidating the results of tethys for the full year in compared to consolidating the results of tethys for the last six months only of and increased levels of professional fees and interest expense in compared to contractual obligations and commercial terms our principal business and assets are derived from production sharing contracts in georgia 
the legislative and procedural regimes governing production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses in georgia have undergone a series of changes in recent years resulting in certain legal uncertainties 
our production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses  entered into prior to the introduction in of a new petroleum law governing such agreements have not  as yet  been amended to reflect or ensure compliance with current legislation 
as a result  despite references in the current legislation grandfathering the terms and conditions of our production sharing contracts  conflicts between the interpretation of our production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses and current legislation could arise 
such conflicts  if they arose  could cause an adverse effect on our rights under the production sharing contracts 
however  the norio psa and the tbilisi psc were concluded after enactment of the petroleum law  and under the terms and conditions of this legislation 
to confirm that the ninotsminda psc and the mineral usage license issued prior to the introduction in of the petroleum law were validly issued  in connection with its preparation of a convertible loan agreement with us  the international finance corporation  an affiliate of the world bank received in november confirmation from the state of georgia  that among other things the state of georgia recognizes and confirms the validity and enforceability of the production sharing contract and the license and all undertakings the state has covenanted with noc thereunder  the license was duly authorized and executed by the state at the time of its issuance and remained in full force and effect throughout its term  and the license constitutes a valid and duly authorized grant by the state  being and remaining in full force and effect as of the signing of this confirmation and the benefits of the license fully extend to noc by virtue of its interest in the license holder and the contractual rights under the production sharing contract 
despite this confirmation and the grandfathering of the terms of existing production sharing contracts in the petroleum law  subsequent legislative or other governmental changes could conflict with  challenge our rights or otherwise change current operations under the production sharing contract 
no challenge has been made to date 
in  a participation agreement for the three well exploration program on the ninotsminda manavi area with aes was terminated without aes earning any rights to any of the ninotsminda manavi area reservoirs 
the company therefore has no present obligations in respect of aes

critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
under these rules  all such costs excluding significant acquisition  exploration and development costs related to unproved properties  are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling  we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 

table of contents natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to calculate reserves 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that it is reasonably possible the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could significantly change in the coming year estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  estimates as to the expected future cash flow from proved oil and gas properties and estimates of future dismantlement and restoration costs 
concentration of credit risk although our cash and temporary investments and accounts receivable are exposed to potential credit loss  we do not believe such risk to be significant 
even though a substantial amount of funds were in accounts at financial institutions which were not covered under bank guarantees  management does not believe that maintaining balances in excess of bank guarantees resulted in a significant risk to the company 
foreign operations our future operations and earnings will depend upon the results of our operations in georgia 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct such operations  and a failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
also  the success of our operations will be subject to numerous contingencies  some of which are beyond management control 
these contingencies include general and regional economic conditions  prices for crude oil and natural gas  competition and changes in regulation 
since we are dependent on international operations  specifically those in georgia  we will be subject to various additional political  economic and other uncertainties 
among other risks  our operations may be subject to the risks and restrictions on transfer of funds  import and export duties  quotas and embargoes  domestic and international customs and tariffs  and changing taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  political conditions and regulations 
recently issued pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

fsp delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not re measured at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november  any amounts recognized upon adoption of this rule as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the company has evaluated sfas no 
and has determined that it will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements  which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained non controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not determined the effect that the application of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on its consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on that review  the company believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
forward looking statements the forward looking statements contained in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are subject to various risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward looking statements 
included among the important risks  uncertainties and other factors are those hereinafter discussed 
few of the forward looking statements in this annual report deal with matters that are within our unilateral control 
joint venture  acquisition  financing and other agreements and arrangements must be negotiated with independent third parties and  in some cases  must be approved by governmental agencies 
these third parties 
table of contents generally have objectives and interests that may not coincide with ours and may conflict with our interests 
unless we are able to compromise these conflicting objectives and interests in a mutually acceptable manner  agreements and arrangements with these third parties will not be consummated 
operating entities in various foreign jurisdictions must be registered by governmental agencies  and production licenses for development of oil and gas fields in various foreign jurisdictions must be granted by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies generally have broad discretion in determining whether to take or approve various actions and matters 
in addition  the policies and practices of governmental agencies may be affected or altered by political  economic and other events occurring either within their own countries or in a broader international context 
finally  due to the developing nature of the legal regimes in many former soviet union countries where we operate  our contractual rights and remedies may be subject to certain legal uncertainties 
our ability to finance all of its present oil and gas projects and other ventures according to present plans is dependent upon obtaining additional funding 
an inability to obtain financing could require us to scale back or abandon part of all of our project development  capital expenditure  production and other plans 
the availability of equity or debt financing to us or to the entities that are developing projects in which we have interests is affected by many factors  including world economic conditions  the state international relations  the stability and policies of various governments located in areas in which we currently operate or intend to operate  fluctuations in the price of oil and gas  the general outlook for the oil and gas industry and competition for available funds  and an evaluation of us and specific projects in which we have an interest 
rising interest rates might affect the feasibility of debt financing that is offered 
potential investors and lenders will be influenced by their evaluations of us and our projects and comparisons with alternative investment opportunities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk is due to changes in oil and gas prices and currency fluctuations 
as indicated elsewhere in this report  as a producer of oil and gas we are exposed to changes in oil and gas prices as well as changes in supply and demand which could affect our revenues 
we do not engage in any commodity hedging activities 
due to the ready market for our production in georgia  we do not believe that any current exposures from this risk will materially affect our financial position at this time  but there can be no assurance that changes in such market will not affect us adversely in the future 
also as indicated elsewhere in this report  because all of our operations are being conducted in the former soviet union  we are potentially exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the relative values of the currencies in areas in which we operate 
at present we do not engage in any currency hedging operations since  to the extent we receive payments for our production and marketing activities in local currencies  we are utilizing such currencies to pay for our local operations 
in addition  our contracts to sell our production from the ninotsminda field in georgia is denominated in us dollars with all export contracts providing for payment in dollars  although we may not always be able to continue to demand payment in us dollars 
we had no material interest in investments subject to market risk during the period covered by this report 
because the majority of all revenue to us is from the sale of production from the ninotsminda field a change in the price of oil or a change in the production rates could have a substantial effect on this revenue and therefore profits 

table of contents assuming the same production in as but decreasing the net oil price we receive from sales by and respectively would change the total annual revenue from oil sales as follows 
the total annual revenue from oil sales for based on an average net oil price received of was approximately  if the average net oil price received was less at then the total annual revenue from oil sales would be reduced by approximately  to approximately  if the average net oil price received was reduced by per barrel then the total annual revenue from oil sales realised would be reduced by approximately  to approximately  assuming all other factors are constant 
assuming constant oil prices a reduction in annual production by and would have the following effect on total annual revenues 
in total oil sales were  bbls of oil producing revenue of approximately  if this was reduced by then the annual revenue from oil sales would be reduced to approximately  if the total annual oil sales were reduced by or  bbls then the total annual revenue from oil sales would be approximately  assuming all other factors are constant
