item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except share and per share data the information contained in this section has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing 
the following discussion is intended to assist in the assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
our business has grown organically in all of our markets 
we derive our net revenues from the sale of health  safety and wellness products for infants and toddlers 
our net revenue is driven by our ability to design and market desirable products  identify business opportunities and secure new and renew existing distribution channels 
our income from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue and collect cash in excess of labor and other costs of providing our products and selling  general and administrative costs 
company overview we are a designer  marketer  and distributor of branded juvenile health  safety and wellness products which are sold principally to large north american and uk retailers 
we currently have more than proprietary products in various product categories including nursery audio video monitors  safety gates  durable bath products  bed rails  infant thermometers  related health and safety products  booster and potty seats  bouncers and a product line of soft goods bedding 
our strategy is to grow net revenues through a variety of methods  including increased product penetration more products at each store  increased store penetration more stores within each retail customer  new products at existing and new customers  new mass merchant retail customers  new distribution channels food and drug chains  price clubs  home centers  web based retailers  new geographies international expansion  and new product categories 
we have been able to grow our annual net revenues historically through a combination of all of the above factors 
each year  we have been able to expand the number of products into our main distribution channel  mass merchant retailers  and have also added new customers each year 
therefore  even without new product introductions  we could grow our business by simply selling more of our existing product line to existing customers 
in the future  our growth strategy will be to continue to develop and sell new products to our existing customer base  sell new and existing products to new customers or expand relationships with existing customers  expand our sales of products from our soft goods product line  and expand in the uk and in other geographic regions including japan  mexico and australia  among others 
in addition  there are a number of potential acquisition candidates that could be pursued in order to obtain new innovative products  new product categories  new retail customers or new sales territories 
there are approximately active juvenile product companies  of which approximately have less than million in sales 
in addition  there are various product categories that we do not currently compete in  including car seats  high chairs  walkers  nursery care  and other categories 
we may look to develop our own products in these categories or attempt to gain entrance into these categories through acquisitions 
as we continue to grow through internal initiatives and any future acquisitions  we will incur additional expenses 
two of the key areas in which those increased expenses will likely occur are sales and product development 
in order to grow sales  we will likely hire additional sales personnel to service new geographic territories  focus existing resources on specific parts of the united states market and retain product line specialists to drive sales of new and existing products in specific areas in which we believe we can readily increase sales 
product development expenses will increase as we develop new products in existing and new categories 
if we were to acquire one or more companies as part of our growth strategy  we would face various challenges such as the integration of the acquired companies product lines  employees  marketing requirements and information systems 
ongoing infrastructure investment also may be required to support realized growth  including expenditures with respect to upgraded and expanded information systems and enhancing our management team 
sales our sales are primarily derived from the sale of juvenile health  safety and wellness products and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
our products are marketed through several distribution channels including chain retailers  specialty retailers and direct to consumers 
a number of large  retail customers account for substantially all of our net revenues 
customers that generated more than of net revenues for the year ended december  were toys r us of such net sales  kmart of such net revenues  and target of such net revenues 
because of the concentration of our business with these customers  and because we have no long term contracts with these customers  our success depends on our customers willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
approximately of net revenues are currently made to customers in north america  with the remaining primarily made to customers in the uk 
sales are made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
we generally accept returns only for defective merchandise 
cost of goods sold and other expenses our products are manufactured by third parties  with approximately of the dollar value of products being manufactured in china and the majority of the balance being manufactured in the united states 
cost of goods sold primarily represents purchases of finished products from these third party manufacturers 
the remainder of our cost of goods sold includes duties on certain imported items  freight in from suppliers and miscellaneous charges from contract manufacturers 
substantially all of our purchases are made in us dollars  therefore most of this activity is not subject to currency fluctuations 
if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along those cost increases through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass these price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
in particular  in  our suppliers based in china faced significant additional costs  as a result of raw materials shortages  the further strengthening of the chinese currency rmb versus the us dollar  rising labor rates and increases in energy prices 
in  the rmb rose by roughly against the us dollar 
additionally  chinese suppliers were impacted by government imposed reductions on tax refunds 
while we anticipate being able to pass on some portion of these increased costs to our customers  continued cost pressures on our suppliers will inevitably be passed on to us 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll  insurance  professional fees  royalties  freight out to customers  product development costs  advertising and marketing expenses including co op advertising allowances as negotiated with certain customers and sales commissions 
several of these items fluctuate with sales  some are based on sales to particular customers and others are based on sales of particular products 
there are not significant variations in seasonal demand for our products 
sales to our retail customers are generally higher in the time frame when retailers take initial shipments of new products 
these orders usually incorporate enough product to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer s distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year  and whether there are any mid year product introductions 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates this summary of our critical accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of our management  which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity 
these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
some of these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates were made 
however  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
nature of operations we are engaged in the design  marketing and distribution of juvenile products 
the majority of our net revenues of total revenues are derived from retail customers in north america 
the remaining of net revenue is derived from retail customers in the united kingdom 
we also maintain a research and development staff in asia no revenues are generated directly out of asia 
revenue recognition we follow the guidance of the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin for revenue recognition 
in general  we record revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of provisions for returns and allowances  product placement fees  customer discounts and other sales related discounts 
we base our estimates for discounts  returns and allowances on negotiated customer terms and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to variability  as actual deductions taken by customers may be different from the estimates recorded 
sales incentives or other consideration given by us to customers that are considered adjustments of the selling price of our products  such as allowances and product placement fees  are reflected as reductions of revenue 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  such as the appearance of our products in a customer s national circular ad  are reflected as selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying statements of income 
trade receivables we carry our trade receivables at net realizable value 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our trade receivables and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a history of past bad debt expense  collections and current credit conditions 
the allowance is adjusted based on actual writeoffs that occur 
we have a credit insurance policy to protect against potential losses up to stated amounts from certain customers 
we do not accrue interest on trade receivables 
a receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the credit terms on the account  typically days for most customers 
we will turn an account over for collection around days past due 
accounts are considered uncollectible if no payments are received to days after they have been turned over for collection 
inventory inventory is comprised of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost  inclusive of freight and duty  or market net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
our warehousing costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory write downs are recorded for damaged  obsolete or slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record write downs based on its review of inventory by product category  including length of time on hand and estimates of future orders for each product 
changes in consumer preferences  as well as demand for products  customer buying patterns and inventory management could impact the inventory valuation 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   the financial accounting standards board adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives no longer be subject to amortization and be tested at least annually for impairment based on discounted cash flows 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition exceeds its carrying amount 
the amount of impairment loss  if any  is measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on our annualized effective tax rate for the year 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
upon the adoption of fin  we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
deferred income tax assets are adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize future tax benefits only to the extent  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not such benefits will be realized 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expect no material changes to unrecognized tax positions within the next twelve months 
other use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
results of operations summer infant  inc and subsidiaries formerly kbl healthcare acquisition corp 
ii consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  net sales  cost of goods sold  gross profit  operating expenses including interest income  income tax expense  net income  the results of operations for the year ended december  represent the general and administrative expenses of our predecessor  kbl healthcare  net of interest income generated by the approximate  in cash that kbl had on its balance sheet 
this cash ultimately funded the kbl summer infant merger 
the results of operations for the year ended december  represent the combined activity of kbl healthcare from january  through march  and the activity of summer infant from march  through december  kbl healthcare historically had no sales or gross profit  while summer infant has both sales and gross profit  in addition to other normal operating expenses 
therefore  the amounts in the two above periods cannot be compared in a meaningful fashion 
to give the reader some additional information on the performance of the underlying summer infant operations  the following table represents the results of the summer infant operating company for the years ended december  and this table is being presented to give the reader more information about the underlying performance of the ongoing operating company  because kbl healthcare had no operating business in summer infant  inc and subsidiaries statements of income for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  net sales   cost of goods sold   gross profit   sg a expenses a   ebitda as adjusted b   a excluding depreciation  amortization  merger related expenses  and stock option expense 
b see non gaap discussion below regarding the computation of ebitda see page 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased from approximately  in the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased distribution of existing products throughout our customer base  introduction of new products  and expansion into new customers 
gross profit increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales  slightly offset by increased cost of goods due to raw material increases and a change in product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased variable costs such as co op advertising allowances as a result of the significant increase in sales 
in addition  there were increased expenditures in product development  headcount  professional fees  and warehouse operations 
to give the reader some additional information on the performance of the underlying summer infant operations  the following table represents the results of the summer infant operating company for the years ended december  and this table is being presented to give the reader more information about the underlying performance of the ongoing operating company  because kbl healthcare had no operating business in or summer infant inc and affiliates combined statements of income for the year ended december  and dollars in thousands december  december  net revenues   cost of goods sold   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses  litigation and deal related fees and expenses  depreciation expense income before interest   interest expense income before taxes and minority interest   income tax expense net income before minority interest   minority interest in net income of affiliate net income   year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased from approximately  in the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased distribution of our products throughout our customer base  with the largest dollar increases occurring at toys r us  target and kmart 
gross profit increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales  combined with sales of higher margin products and reductions in customer product returns during  which resulted in a reduction of cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases in headcount to build the infrastructure required to support the rapid sales increase  in addition to costs incurred in the development of the soft goods line 
litigation and merger related expenses increased from for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to fees associated with the kbl merger  legal fees associated with the start up of the soft goods product line introduced for  and litigation costs associated with a lawsuit filed by dorel that was settled in depreciation and amortization expense increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased capital spending during which resulted in higher depreciation expense in interest expense increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased borrowing levels in to support our rapid growth in revenues and working capital needs 
net income increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increased sales and gross profit percentage as described above 
liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our operations and working capital needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
our sales have increased significantly over the past several years 
for the year ended december   net sales of the summer infant operating companies were  for the year ended december   net sales of the summer infant operating companies were approximately  this sales growth has led to a substantial increase in working capital requirements  specifically accounts receivable and inventory 
the typical cash flow cycle is as follows inventory is purchased to meet expected demand plus a safety stock 
because the majority of our vendors are based in asia  inventory takes from four to six weeks to arrive from asia to the various distribution points we maintain in the us and the uk 
payment terms for these vendors average days from the date the product ships from asia  therefore we are generally paying for the product a short time after it is physically received in the us 
the increased sales we have experienced result in increased levels of inventory  and therefore an increase in the amount of cash required to fund our inventory level 
sales to customers generally have payment terms of to days 
the increased sales have resulted in an increase in the level of accounts receivable  and therefore have increased the amount of cash required to fund working capital 
we have traditionally been able to fund our increased working capital through asset based lines of credit with banks 
the lenders generally follow a borrowing base formula that allows advances based on the levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
our current line of credit contains traditional borrowing base formulas 
the majority of our capital expenditures are for tools related to new product introductions 
we receive indications from retailers generally around the middle of each year as to what products the retailer will be taking into its product line for the upcoming year 
based on these indications  we will then acquire the tools required to build the products 
in most cases the payments for the tools are spread out over a three to four month period 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  this amount primarily represents the increase in accounts receivable and inventory for the period from march date of acquisition of summer infant to december   due to increased sales during that time frame 
these amounts were offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased purchasing during the final months of  due to increased demand in the first quarter of net cash used in investing activities was  which related primarily to the cash paid to summer shareholders plus deal fees in conjunction with the kbl summer merger that was completed on march   and  of acquisitions of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was  which primarily consists of the paydown of summer s prior outstanding line of credit balance of  using the proceeds from the kbl summer merger plus the  paid to those kbl shareholders who voted against the merger  and who therefore received cash in exchange for their shares of common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  we also borrowed from our existing line of credit to repurchase warrants in a tender offer for  our strategy for funding our business going forward is a combination of increased profitability and increased borrowing lines as required with traditional lenders asset based to fund our business as well as potential acquisitions 
this liquidity could potentially be used to pay off the existing building debt of summer  fund working capital increases going forward  acquire other businesses  pay dividends  or repurchase common stock or warrants 
in july  we entered into a revolving line of credit with a bank  which provides for borrowings based on levels of qualified accounts receivable and inventory 
the line of credit is secured by all of our assets 
the line of credit has been increased several times  and currently the maximum available credit totals  the line of credit runs through june   with this date having been extended several times by the bank  and we believe that the bank will extend the line of credit beyond this date 
interest on the line of credit is payable at libor plus 
as of december   there was  outstanding on the line of credit 
in connection with the line of credit  we are subject to certain covenants  which require  among other things  maintenance of total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio as well as a certain level of net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  we believe that our cash on hand and current banking facilities are sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  unforeseen circumstances  such as softness in the retail industry or deterioration in the business of a significant customer  could create a situation where we cannot access all of the available lines of credit due to not having sufficient accounts receivable 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will meet all of our bank covenants in the future  or that our lenders will grant waivers if there are covenant violations 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments at december  in s payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond line of credit   estimated future interest payments on line of credit   operating leases    capital leases construction loan   total contractual cash obligations    estimated future interest payments on our line of credit were based upon the interest rates in effect at december  off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during either of the years ended december  and non gaap discussion in addition to our gaap results  we also disclose non gaap measures of our performance 
ebitda  as defined below  is an important supplemental financial measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
as used herein  ebitda represents net income loss before income taxes  minority interest in net income of affiliates  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization and non cash stock option expense 
our management uses ebitda as a financial measure to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness  meet capital expenditure and working capital requirements  and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due 
we believe that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information regarding our results of operations because it assists in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business 
we believe that ebitda is useful to stockholders as a measure of comparative operating performance  as it is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation and amortization and more reflective of changes in pricing decisions  cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance 
ebitda also is used by our management for multiple purposes  including to calculate and support various coverage ratios with our lenders  to allow lenders to calculate total proceeds they are willing to loan to us based on our relative strength compared to other competitors  and to more accurately compare our operating performance from period to period and company to company by eliminating differences caused by variations in capital structures which affect relative interest expense  tax positions and amortization of intangibles 
although we use ebitda as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business  there are material limitations to using a measure such as ebitda  including the difficulty associated with using it as the sole measure to compare the results of one company to another and the inability to analyze significant items that directly affect a company s net income loss or operating income because it does not include certain material costs  such as interest and taxes  necessary to operate its business 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measures that are computed in accordance with gaap 
our management compensates for these limitations in considering ebitda in conjunction with its analysis of other gaap financial measures  such as net income loss 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income before interest for the summer operating companies on a stand alone basis  for the periods presented reconciliation of income before interest to adjusted ebitda in s year ended december income before interest    plus depreciation and amortization  plus litigation and merger related expenses  plus non cash stock option expense adjusted ebitda  as defined    the increase in ebitda for the past two fiscal years has been primarily the result of the sales increases that have occurred 
sales increased from  in to  in and  in for the years ended december  and  ebitda  as defined  includes the addition of certain litigation and deal related expenses
