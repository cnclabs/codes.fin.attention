item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 

table of contents collaborative relationships novo nordisk option and license agreement as part of our separation from novo nordisk in  we granted novo nordisk options to license certain rights to potential therapeutic proteins pursuant to an option and license agreement  which expired in november under this agreement  we retained exclusive rights to these proteins in north america  and novo nordisk could obtain exclusive rights in the rest of the world 
however  novo nordisk maintained the option to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to any licensed protein that acts to generate  expand or prevent the death of insulin producing beta cells  which are involved in diabetes  a core business of novo nordisk 
upon the exercise of an option by novo nordisk to license the rights outside north america to the proteins  we negotiated an exclusive license agreement to commercialize these proteins containing certain predetermined terms  including up front payments  milestone payments and royalties 
over the six year term of the agreement  novo nordisk licensed the rights outside north america to seven proteins  of which three licenses have been subsequently terminated 
currently  licenses are in effect for il  il  il and one undisclosed protein 
in december  novo nordisk notified us of its decision to terminate the il license agreement 
accordingly  the agreement will be terminated effective june  six months following the notification 
in january  novo nordisk announced that it is discontinuing its oncology research and development program and it intends to out license its rights to il in march  we signed a license agreement with novo nordisk for exclusive rights to il in north america  effectively giving them worldwide rights under our intellectual property in this protein 
under the agreement  we have received a total of million to date  and have the potential to receive future milestone payments and royalties based on sales 
novo nordisk data sharing and cross license agreement for il in august  we signed a collaborative data sharing and cross license agreement with novo nordisk for the development of il under the terms of this agreement  we and novo nordisk will collaborate to develop and execute a global clinical development plan for il to achieve regulatory approval of a common product in the companies respective territories 
there are no substantive obligations under the agreement and all activities falling under the global clinical development plan are intended to be performed separately  with each company being responsible for its own costs 
however  if agreed to by both companies  the development activities can be performed jointly  with the two companies sharing all costs according to a cost sharing methodology  which will be determined prior to initiation of these activities 
the agreement also includes a cross license for intellectual property that will arise in the implementation of the global clinical development plan 
the agreement will expire on the later of completion of the global development plan or the expiration of the related patents 
either party can terminate the agreement at any time with six months prior notice 
in january  the parties entered into a clinical manufacturing and chemistry  manufacturing  and control cmc development services agreement  under which novo nordisk will supply clinical materials  in quantities sufficient to meet requirements of the global clinical development plan  and certain services 
we can terminate this agreement at any time  bearing full or partial costs of manufacturing activities planned to begin within a specified period of time 
in the event the agreement is terminated due to the termination of the collaborative data sharing and cross license agreement discussed above  novo nordisk will be responsible for supplying il in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the current global development plan for up to three years from the effective date of termination 
merck serono strategic alliance agreement in october  we executed a strategic alliance agreement with serono sa to research  develop and commercialize novel protein and antibody therapeutics derived from our proprietary gene and protein portfolio 

table of contents following the acquisition of serono in by merck kgaa  serono s rights under this agreement have been held by merck serono sa  an affiliate of merck kgaa 
the strategic alliance agreement has a five year term  with a maximum three year research period for each candidate that may extend beyond the five year term on a candidate by candidate basis 
as part of the strategic alliance  merck serono receives an exclusive option  which was subordinated to the novo nordisk option agreement discussed above  to acquire rights to product development candidates resulting from research under the strategic alliance 
the number of candidates within our core research areas to which merck serono may obtain rights is limited to  while for candidates in our non core areas the number is unlimited 
exclusive worldwide licenses to two preclinical stage candidates  fgf and il ra 
an agreement for our preclinical stage candidate il in north america that provides for co development and co promotion for any protein products that target il  including monoclonal antibodies  within the united states through emd serono  the united states operation of merck serono  and exclusive licenses to merck serono in mexico and emd serono in canada 
in return  we receive a million upfront option fee 
million in license fees for fgf  il ra and il  as well as potential future milestone payments of million and royalties based on product sales 
an equal share of the profit from the co commercialization of any product within the united states 
upfront fees and potential milestone payments related to development progress  regulatory submissions and approvals for every candidate exclusively licensed or co developed by merck serono 
royalties on product sales outside the united states for co developed products  and on worldwide product sales for licensed products 
royalty rates for candidates in our core areas are higher than for candidates in our non core areas 
similarly  royalty rates for protein therapeutics are higher than for antibody therapeutics 
in addition  merck serono purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for a total of million  and entered into a related lockup agreement and a standstill agreement 
during the research stage of the collaboration  the two companies will work together for five years to identify new development candidates from our proprietary portfolio of genes and proteins 
each company may at its own expense work with non core genes  while we have exclusive rights to evaluate genes within our core research areas 
upon the generation of a medical hypothesis by either company for a candidate derived from a core or non core gene  merck serono has a specified amount of time to make a decision whether or not to co fund continued research on the candidate 
if merck serono declines to continue  all rights to the candidate revert to us 
if merck serono decides to collaborate  it will fund the majority of the research costs if we decide to participate  or of the costs if we decline 
the research collaboration for a candidate can continue for up to three years or until the candidate reaches the point of being designated a product development candidate 
at this time  merck serono has an option to obtain rights to the candidate 
if we collaborated and co funded research on the candidate  we can choose whether or not to co develop and co promote in the united states together with emd serono  but if merck serono funded of the research costs  merck serono s rights to the candidate will be exclusive 
merck serono has a specified amount of time in which to exercise this option 
merck serono licensed the rights to il rc  which was designated as a product development candidate in june 
table of contents for any candidate that is co developed  the two companies will work together on the clinical development in the united states and european union and commercialization of related product candidates within the united states 
these activities will be governed by a steering committee with equal representation from the two companies 
the majority of the development costs will be paid by merck serono 
the expenses of commercialization and the profit from selling any resulting products in the united states will be split evenly between the two companies 
outside the united states  merck serono will pay us a royalty on product sales 
at any point in time during the development period  we have an option to stop our contributions and convert a co development relationship to a license 
merck serono development and marketing agreement for atacicept in august  we entered into a collaborative development and marketing agreement with ares trading sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of serono sa  focused on product candidates derived from two cellular receptors  designated taci and bcma  that are involved in the regulation of the human immune system 
following the acquisition of serono by merck kgaa in  serono s rights under this agreement have been held by merck serono sa during the term of the agreement  we will work together exclusively with merck serono and its united states operation emd serono to develop biopharmaceutical products based on the two receptors 
the ongoing co development of atacicept in autoimmune diseases and cancer is pursuant to this agreement 
we share research and development expenses worldwide with the exception of japan  where merck serono covers all expenses 
the research and development activities are governed by a steering committee made up of an equal number of representatives from each company 
merck serono is responsible for manufacturing all products for both clinical trials and commercial sale 
we retain the right to co promote the sale of products with emd serono in north america so long as we fund our share of the research and development expenses and meet certain sales force and marketing requirements 
we will share commercialization expenses and profits in north america equally with emd serono and merck serono will have exclusive rights to market and sell products in the rest of the world  for which we will be entitled to receive royalties 
prior to regulatory approval  either company may terminate its co development and co funding obligations upon days notice 
if we were to terminate our co development obligations  merck serono would  at its expense  take control of all research and development  and we would forego our co promotion rights in north america 
we still would be entitled to receive royalties on any product sales in north america in lieu of sharing in the profits from the sale of products and merck serono would continue to be obligated to make any milestone payments 
if merck serono were to terminate its co development obligations  all rights in any products would revert to us  and we could take control and fund all costs of the research and development  subject to negotiation of a commercially reasonable financial consideration to be paid to merck serono 
furthermore  merck serono would be obligated to manufacture product for use in clinical testing for up to one year from the termination date 
in addition  we may terminate our co promotion rights in north america while continuing to co fund commercialization in north america or terminate both our co promotion rights and co funding obligations 
if we terminate our right to co promote in north america but continue to co fund commercialization  we would share profits in north america equally with emd serono although emd serono would control commercialization in north america 
if we terminate our right to co promote in north america and our obligation to co fund commercialization  we would be entitled to receive royalties on any product sales in north america in lieu of sharing in the profits from the sale of products 
we granted merck serono an exclusive license to our intellectual property relating to taci  bcma and certain other related technologies to make  use  have made  sell  offer to sell and import products based on taci and bcma 
merck serono is required to pay royalties on sales  which may vary based on annual sales volume and the degree of patent protection provided by the licensed intellectual property 
royalty payments may be reduced if merck serono is required to license additional intellectual property from one or more third parties in 
table of contents order to commercialize a product or  in certain circumstances  if a product suffers from competition 
royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country by country basis until the date on which no valid patent claims relating to a product exist or  if the product is not covered by a valid patent claim  years from the date of first sale of the product 
the term of the agreement began on august  and will continue for as long as a taci or bcma product is the subject of an active development project or there is an obligation to pay royalties under the agreement 
the agreement provides for an initial fee and milestone payments to be paid by merck serono in connection with the development and approval of products  up to an aggregate of million of which million has been received to date 
bayer license and collaboration agreement for rthrombin and us co promotion agreement for recothrom in june  we executed a license and collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag and a us co promotion agreement with bayer healthcare llc 
pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement  bayer schering will develop and commercialize the initial presentations of rthrombin outside the united states 
pursuant to the co promotion agreement  bayer healthcare will contribute sales people and medical science liaisons for the first three years following the launch of recothrom in the united states 
in addition  the license and collaboration agreement includes provisions through which the two companies may collaborate to develop subsequent presentations or line extensions of rthrombin  which we will commercialize within the united states and bayer will commercialize outside the united states 
as part of these agreements  bayer receives development and commercialization rights to rthrombin outside the united states 
a tiered commission of up to on recothrom sales in the united states during a three year co promotion period 
for two years following the end of the co promotion period  a sales commission will be paid at a reduced rate  subject to an annual maximum 
up to million in sales bonus payments upon achievement of certain sales levels of recothrom in the united states 
an option to co develop new presentations or line extensions of rthrombin and commercialize them outside the united states 
in return  we receive a million upfront payment 
a million milestone payment upon the approval of recothrom in the united states 
up to million in development and sales based milestone payments based on bayer schering s development and sales of rthrombin products outside the united states 
tiered royalties based on annual sales of rthrombin products outside the united states 
under the license and collaboration agreement  each party is free to research and develop new presentations or line extensions of rthrombin provided that it proposes the new presentation to the other party within a specified period prior to filing an ind for the new presentation 
the other party may then opt to co develop the new presentation by co funding the past and future development cost provided that the cost of certain territory specific activities is not shared 
the co development activities would be governed by a steering committee with equal representation from the two companies 
within the united states  we would have exclusive commercial rights to any new presentation that we co developed with bayer schering or which we proposed and bayer schering declined to co develop 
however  we would have no rights to any new presentation proposed by bayer 
table of contents schering that we declined to co develop 
outside the united states  bayer schering would have exclusive commercial rights to any new presentation that it co developed with us or which it proposed and we declined to co develop  and would pay us a royalty on product sales 
under no circumstances may we commercialize a presentation of rthrombin outside the united states nor  except for the role of bayer healthcare under the co promotion agreement  may bayer schering commercialize a presentation of rthrombin within the united states 
other out licensed product candidates in addition to the products we are developing internally or with co development partners  we have out licensed several product candidates to third parties in return for milestone payments and royalties gem os tm gem os tm platelet derived growth factor is a combination of platelet derived growth factor pdgf bb and a synthetic bone matrix 
pdgf bb is a growth factor that stimulates the growth of a variety of cell types  including bone forming cells 
we have out licensed this protein to biomimetic therapeutics  inc for the treatment of bone defects 
biomimetic is developing gem os for the treatment of fractures in open surgical setting and gem os for the treatment of fractures in closed surgical setting and for prophylactic bone augmentation 
biomimetic has completed a pivotal trial in canada and is conducting pivotal trials in the united states and europe to evaluate gem os for use in foot and ankle fusion procedures 
other clinical studies are also being conducted to evaluate gem os for fracture repair 
rfactor xiii is a recombinant version of a protein that is involved in blood clotting  and is being developed for the treatment of bleeding disorders 
novo nordisk acquired rights to this protein in october after we completed several phase clinical trials in healthy volunteers and in patients with congenital factor xiii deficiency 
novo nordisk is conducting a phase study of rfactor xiii in patients undergoing cardiac surgery 
fibroblast growth factor fgf is a novel member of the fibroblast growth factor family of proteins 
our preclinical data suggest that fgf may be useful for healing cartilage damaged by injury or disease 
we out licensed this protein to merck serono in october as part of the strategic alliance 
in late  merck serono initiated a phase clinical trial of fgf for the treatment of osteoarthritis 
il is a member of the il cytokine family 
in september  novo nordisk licensed the rights to il outside north america pursuant to the option and license agreement 
in march  they licensed the rights to il in north america under a separate agreement 
our preclinical data suggest that il may play an important role in the regulation of cutaneous inflammation and the pathology of psoriasis  and therefore is a potential target for the treatment of psoriasis 
il receptor subunit alpha il ra is a cytokine receptor that signals both il and il activities and which is a potential target for the treatment of psoriasis 
we out licensed this protein to merck serono in october as part of the strategic alliance 
currently marketed products we have participated in the discovery or development of six recombinant protein products marketed by other companies 
novolin insulin and insulin analogs are marketed by novo nordisk worldwide for the treatment of diabetes 
in collaboration with novo nordisk  we developed a process for the production of recombinant human insulin in yeast that is used by novo nordisk 
novoseven recombinant factor viia  a protein involved in the generation of blood clots  marketed worldwide by novo nordisk for the treatment of hemophilia patients 
we cloned the gene that codes for human factor vii and developed a process for the production of activated recombinant human 
table of contents factor vii  or recombinant factor viia  which led to the establishment of the manufacturing process that novo nordisk currently uses to produce this protein 
regranex platelet derived growth factor is a growth factor marketed by ortho mcneil pharmaceuticals  inc  a johnson johnson company  for the treatment of non healing diabetic ulcers 
we cloned the gene that codes for platelet derived growth factor and demonstrated the importance of this protein in stimulating wound healing 
gem s platelet derived growth factor is a combination of a platelet derived growth factor with a synthetic bone matrix  developed by biomimetic therapeutics  inc and marketed by osteohealth company  a division of luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc for the treatment of bone loss and gum tissue recession associated with advanced periodontal disease

glucagen glucagon is a protein marketed by novo nordisk  bedford laboratories and eisai co  ltd 
for use as an aid for gastrointestinal motility inhibition and for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia in diabetic patients treated with insulin 
in collaboration with novo nordisk  we developed a process for the production of this protein that is currently used by novo nordisk in the manufacture of glucagen 
cleactor tpa analog is a modified form of the protein tissue plasminogen activator  marketed in japan by eisai for the treatment of myocardial infarction  or heart attacks 
in collaboration with eisai  we developed this modified protein  which has enhanced properties that allow it to be given as a single injection 
we earn royalties on sales of all these products except for novoseven and novorapid  for which we received a one time payment to satisfy future royalty obligations 
additionally  due to recent patent expirations  we no longer receive royalties on glucagen or novolin sales  except in certain minor countries 
in the aggregate  from sales of these products and other technology licenses  we earned royalties of million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
manufacturing recothrom also referred to as rthrombin 
in preparation for the recothrom launch in the united states  we established a commercial supply chain  which relies on single source vendors 
we have entered into a long term manufacturing agreement with abbott laboratories for commercial scale production of recombinant thrombin rthrombin  the bulk active drug substance in recothrom 
under the agreement  abbott manufactures rthrombin using mammalian cells  according to specifications developed and agreed upon by both companies 
abbott has committed to supply each year up to a maximum amount  which we believe is sufficient to meet our projected market demand and provide adequate safety stock 
the agreement will terminate in to obtain raw material for manufacture of rthrombin bulk drug substance  we have entered into long term supply agreements with the supplier of snake protein and the manufacturer of immobilized prothrombin activator pta  which is used to activate prethrombin  the precursor for rthrombin 
we have also entered into a long term manufacturing services agreement with patheon  inc for fill and finish of rthrombin 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with anderson packaging  inc  a division of amerisourcebergen corp  as our secondary packaging vendor and cardinal health sps  inc as our third party logistics and distribution partner 
under the terms of a license and collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma ag  we will supply vials of rthrombin for up to five years from june   the effective date of the agreement 
thereafter  we will supply rthrombin bulk drug substance throughout the term of the license and collaboration agreement 
atacicept 
merck serono is responsible for manufacturing atacicept for both clinical trials and commercial sale under the terms of our collaborative development and marketing agreement 
the product is made in mammalian cells 
in  merck serono completed development of a commercial manufacturing process for phase and phase clinical trial material 
to date  merck serono has manufactured clinical grade materials in 
table of contents quantities adequate to supply ongoing clinical trials and is expected to have adequate manufacturing capacity to provide sufficient supplies for future clinical trials and  ultimately  the commercial market 
merck serono also manufactures certain product candidates  such as il rc  as part of collaborative programs under the strategic alliance agreement 
il our initial clinical supply of il  which is made in e 
coli  was manufactured by avecia limited using a process we developed 
in january  we entered into a clinical manufacturing and chemistry  manufacturing  and control cmc development services agreement with novo nordisk 
under the terms of this agreement  novo nordisk is required to supply clinical materials in quantities sufficient to support il development according to a global development plan adopted by the two companies 
in the event the agreement is terminated due to the termination of the collaborative data sharing and cross license  novo nordisk will be responsible for supplying il in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of the current global development plan for up to three years from the effective date of termination 
other 
we have established internal manufacturing capabilities to supply various products for toxicology studies and clinical trials 
our pilot scale gmp manufacturing facility gives us the capability to manufacture products using bacterial and mammalian cell production systems 
in  we continued production of peg ifn l clinical supplies  using a high yield internally developed e 
coli process 
we believe that we have produced sufficient supplies of peg ifn l to support clinical development though phase we also plan to use the facility to produce our antibody and antibody like product candidates  which are expected to move into clinical development in these product candidates will be manufactured using mammalian cell culture recombinant technology 
some of the inventions licensed to us were initially developed at universities or other not for profit institutions with funding support from an agency of the united states government 
in accordance with federal law  we or our licensees may be required to manufacture products covered by patents in those inventions in the united states  unless we can obtain a waiver from the government on the basis that such domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible 
commercialization to commercialize recothrom in the united states  we established our own dedicated commercial operations team with sales and sales operations  marketing  and supply chain and inventory management functions 
while we believe that the thrombin market  with its concentrated customer base  can be addressed with a relatively small sales force and that our recombinant technology gives us a competitive advantage in the current market  we entered into a three year co promotion agreement with bayer healthcare to further facilitate rapid conversion and maximize penetration of recothrom in the united states market 
our dedicated sales force  consisting of six regional business directors and surgical sales managers with extensive healthcare and pharmaceutical experience  was fully deployed in october under the co promotion agreement  bayer is providing dedicated sales people  allocated to five regions 
the combined sales force has been actively profiling the top bovine thrombin accounts as primary target for conversion to recothrom  by focusing on key surgeons  clinical pharmacists  operating room nurses and pharmacy and therapeutics p t committee members within each account 
with our other product candidates  we will continue to pursue our three pronged strategy for development and commercialization described below 
internal development 
we intend to independently develop products for markets in north america that we believe can be successfully developed with our current infrastructure  as well as reasonable additions that can be made to our infrastructure over the next few years 
to qualify for internal development  product candidates must satisfy a number of criteria 
formulation  development and manufacturing of these products must initially be 
table of contents feasible through the use of our own facilities or contract providers 
the anticipated clinical trials must be of a reasonable size and with fairly well defined endpoints and guidelines 
finally  the clinical indications and target markets must be accessible with reasonable sales and marketing efforts 
co development 
we intend to develop certain product candidates jointly with other companies 
in these arrangements  we would expect to pay a share of the research and development costs  retain rights to co promote or co market the potential products  and share in the profits from selling the potential products 
our criteria for selecting product candidates for co development include our level of internal expertise related to the field  manufacturing requirements  clinical trial size and complexity  target market size and investment considerations 
if we determine that it is desirable to invest our capital in a development program for a product candidate  but we do not believe that we can internally meet the development requirements  we will seek a co development partner 
atacicept meets the criteria for co development  and we have an ongoing development and marketing collaboration with merck serono for this product candidate 
out licensing 
we intend to derive value from other product candidates through out licensing to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
from out licensing transactions  we would expect to earn up front license fees  milestone payments and royalties on sales 
we also would expect no ongoing participation  financial or otherwise  in development activities of these out licensed products 
we have out licensed rfactor xiii and il to novo nordisk  and fgf and il ra to merck serono 
we believe that both of these companies have the infrastructure and expertise to capture and maximize the market value of these product candidates 
patents and proprietary rights we seek appropriate patent protection for our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the united states 
we have more than unexpired issued or allowed united states patents  and over pending united states patent applications 
when appropriate  we also seek foreign patent protection and to date have more than issued or allowed foreign patents 
our patents and patent applications are primarily directed to therapeutic protein based products 
we commonly seek claims directed to compositions of matter for genes and proteins  methods of using and methods of making 
when appropriate  we also seek claims to related technologies  such as release assays 
we maintain patents and prosecute applications  worldwide  for technologies that we have outlicensed 
similarly  for development projects that are partnered  we work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts  including filings  prosecution  defense and enforcement 
as our development product candidates advance through research and development  we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions  such as combinations  improvements to methods of manufacturing or purification  and methods of treatment 
we also work closely with our researchers to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our research and development pipeline 

table of contents patents expire  on a country by country basis  at various times depending on various factors  including the filing date of the corresponding patent application s  the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates  terminal disclaimers  etc 
for our commercial product and each of our product candidates  we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications and expect to obtain multiple patents 
the table below provides expected dates for the first patent expiration in patent portfolios for our commercial product  recothrom  and product candidates in our development pipeline 
each expiration date may be subject to patent term extension  where the length of term extension would not exceed five years under current law and depends on factors such as the amount of time taken by the fda to review the first marketing approval application of a drug covered by the patent 
commercial product product candidate first patent expiration date recothrom rthrombin december  expected to extend until july under patent term extension atacicept march il march peg ifn l september il rc june il mab january we require our research personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies  which are designed to strengthen and support our patent efforts 
in addition to our patented intellectual property  we also develop and seek to protect unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information  including our genetic sequence database  bioinformatics algorithms  research  preclinical and clinical data and development strategies 
our policy is to require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and proprietary information agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us 
these agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us 
these agreements  however  may not provide effective protection of our technology  confidential information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  may not provide adequate remedies 
as part of our business strategy  we work with third parties in our research and development activities 
accordingly  disputes may arise about inventorship  ownership and corresponding rights to know how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our corporate partners  licensors  scientific collaborators and consultants 
in addition  other parties may circumvent any proprietary protection we do have 
these parties may independently develop equivalent technologies or independently gain access to and disclose substantially equivalent information  and confidentially agreements and material transfer agreements we have entered into with them may not provide us with effective protection 
refer to item a 
risk factors for additional information relating to our patents and proprietary rights 
government regulation regulation by government authorities in the united states  europe  japan and other countries is a significant consideration in our ongoing research and product development activities and in the manufacture and marketing of our potential products 
the fda and comparable regulatory bodies in other countries currently regulate therapeutic proteins and related pharmaceutical products as biologics 
biologics are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation by the fda  including regulations that govern the collection  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  potency  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of the products 
the time required for completing testing and obtaining approvals of our product candidates is uncertain but will take several years 
any delay in testing may hinder product development 
in addition  we may encounter delays 
table of contents in product development or rejections of product applications due to changes in fda or foreign regulatory policies during the period of product development and testing 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may subject us to  among other things  civil penalties and criminal prosecution  restrictions on product development and production  suspension  delay or withdrawal of approvals  and the seizure or recall of products 
the lengthy process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any delay or failure  by us or our corporate partners  to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our ability to commercialize product candidates  receive royalty payments and generate sales revenue 
the nature and extent of the governmental pre market review process for our potential products will vary  depending on the regulatory categorization of particular products 
the necessary steps before a new biological product may be marketed in the united states ordinarily include nonclinical laboratory and animal tests  compliance with product manufacturing requirements including  but not limited to  current good manufacturing practices gmp regulations  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug ind application  which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use  submission to the fda of a biologics license application bla or a new drug application nda  and fda review and approval of the bla or nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product 
nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety concerns and efficacy of the product 
nonclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with current good laboratory practices regulations 
the results of nonclinical tests  together with extensive manufacturing information  analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application  which must become effective before the initiation of clinical trials 
the ind application will automatically become effective days after receipt by the fda unless the fda indicates that the application does not contain sufficient information to permit initiation of the clinical studies 
if the fda raises any concerns related to the clinical program  it is possible that these concerns will not be resolved quickly  if at all 
in addition  the fda may impose a clinical hold on a proposed or ongoing clinical trial if  for example  safety concerns arise  in which case the trial cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization under terms sanctioned by the agency 
clinical trials involve the administration of the product to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials are conducted in accordance with current good clinical practices regulations under protocols that detail the objectives of the trial  inclusion and exclusion criteria  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
protocols for each phase of the clinical trials are submitted to the fda as part of the original ind application or as an amendment to the ind application 
further  each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board at each institution 
the institutional review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
an institutional review board may require changes in a protocol  and the submission of an ind application does not guarantee that a trial will be initiated or completed 
clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
in phase  the initial product is administered to healthy human subjects or patients  or both  to assess safety  metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses 
phase usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific  targeted indications  
table of contents to determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage  and to further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks 
if a compound appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluations  phase trials may be undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy in comparison to standard therapies  generally within a broader patient population at geographically dispersed clinical sites 
phase protocols are reviewed with the fda to establish endpoints and data handling parameters 
phase  phase or phase testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time  if at all  with respect to any of our potential products 
furthermore  we  an institutional review board  the fda or other regulatory bodies may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of pharmaceutical development  nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the fda in the form of a bla or nda for approval of the manufacture  marketing and commercial shipment of the biological product 
a bla or nda contains extensive manufacturing information  and each manufacturing facility and quality system must be inspected and approved by the fda before a bla or nda can be approved 
the inspection and approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and resources  and necessary approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda may deny a bla or nda if applicable regulatory criteria or clinical endpoints have not been met 
the fda may also require additional testing of the product or other information  or require post market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
in addition  after marketing approval is granted  the fda may require post marketing clinical trials  which typically entail extensive patient monitoring and may result in restricted marketing of an approved product for an extended period of time 
some of our product candidates may qualify as orphan drugs under the orphan drug act of this act generally provides incentives to manufacturers who undertake development and marketing of products to treat relatively rare diseases  defined as those diseases that affect fewer than  persons in the united states 
orphan drug status is granted for a product within a specific indication  therefore  it is possible for more than one product to receive orphan drug designation for the same indication 
a product that receives orphan drug designation by the fda is entitled to various advantages  including a seven year exclusive marketing period in the united states for that product claim and certain tax credits 
in  the fda granted il orphan drug status for the treatment of melanoma patients with advanced or aggressive disease 
however  it is possible that in the future none of our product candidates will be designated as an orphan drug by the fda 
orphan drug designation may or may not have a positive effect on our revenues 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health services act 
this authority extends to compliance with product manufacturing requirements  including current gmp regulations 
prior to approval of a bla or nda  all third parties  domestic or foreign  that are involved in manufacturing  testing or release of our products must pass an fda inspection of their facility and quality systems 
the facilities are inspected for compliance with applicable requirements  including current gmp guidelines  and must submit to continued periodic inspection by the fda 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and criminal penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from fda standards 
in addition  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote biologics  including  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotions  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
failure to abide by these regulations can result in civil and criminal penalties  as well as a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda 
fda marketing approval is only applicable in the united states 
marketing approval in foreign countries is subject to the regulations of those countries 
the approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing 
the time required to obtain approval outside of the united states may differ from that required for fda approval 
there are centralized procedures for filings in the european union eu countries  which allow submission of a single marketing authorization application to obtain approval in the approximately countries of the eu 
outside of the eu  most countries generally have their own procedures and requirements  
table of contents and compliance with these procedures and requirements may be expensive and time consuming 
accordingly  there may be delays in obtaining required approvals from foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed  if approvals are ultimately received at all 
we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations  industry guidelines and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals  and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our work 
government regulations that might result from future legislation or administrative action  including additions or changes to environmental laws  may materially affect our business operations and revenues 
competition we currently face competition from a range of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic and research institutions 
we compete with these entities to discover and obtain proprietary rights to new genes and their corresponding proteins and to commercialize the products we develop from these genes and proteins 
some of our competitors have greater resources and experience than we have in discovering  developing  manufacturing and selling protein based products 
we expect that competition in our field will continue to be intense 
recothrom  which was recently approved by the fda for use as a topical hemostat in the united states  is expected to face substantial competition in the topical hemostat market 
in addition to recothrom  there are two stand alone thrombin products currently available in the united states thrombin jmi  a bovine plasma derived thrombin from king pharmaceuticals  inc and evithrom  a pooled human plasma derived thrombin  from omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc and ethicon  inc 
also  a number of other hemostatic agents are currently available on the market  including topical hemostats and fibrin sealants from johnson johnson wound management  a division of ethicon  inc  and the biosurgery business unit of baxter bioscience 
furthermore  new products and technologies could be developed in the future to limit or control bleeding during surgeries 
we anticipate that our other product candidates currently in research or development will face intense competition in their respective therapeutic areas from gene or protein based products as well as other therapies 
in our efforts to research and develop new therapeutic proteins we will compete with other entities that are involved in the research and development of therapeutic proteins  including genentech  inc  human genome sciences  inc  medarex  inc 
and biogen idec inc  among others 
we also will face competition from large pharmaceutical and other companies that develop other types of products related to particular diseases 
although we believe that we are well positioned to compete effectively with respect to our existing and potential competitors  our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully maintain and expand as appropriate recothrom commercial infrastructure  including the product supply and sales force  and establish commercial infrastructure for other product candidates as necessary  develop products that are safer  more efficacious or more convenient to administer than other products in the marketplace  leverage our established collaborations and enter into new collaborations to support the development of our products  obtain timely regulatory approvals  manufacture our products in a cost effective manner in quantities sufficient to meet market demands  obtain adequate reimbursement from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and health maintenance organizations  
table of contents identify new product candidates through our internal discovery efforts or through in licensing  and obtain and enforce adequate patent protection for our genes  proteins and technologies 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including employees dedicated to research and development and employees dedicated to sales and marketing 
each of our employees had signed confidentiality and intellectual property agreements  and no employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced employment related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good 
in february  we reduced our existing workforce by approximately employees  primarily in research and development  to reflect the evolving focus of our business

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to invest in our company because these risk factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
however  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business our near term success is highly dependent on the commercialization of recothrom recombinant thrombin 
prior to the launch of recothrom in the united states in january  we had never sold or marketed a product 
our ability to generate product sales in the foreseeable future will depend solely on the commercialization of this product 
the successful commercialization of recothrom will depend on many factors  including the following successfully maintaining a product supply chain to meet demand  successfully maintaining a commercial infrastructure  including a sales force  competition from products that are already approved or are being developed  our ability to penetrate the existing thrombin market with recothrom and develop line extensions  acceptance by the medical community  and approval in jurisdictions outside the united states 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize recothrom  or if we are significantly limited in doing so  our business will be materially harmed 

table of contents we may be unable to successfully commercialize recothrom in the face of substantial competition 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the marketplace and gain market acceptance of recothrom 
we expect recothrom to face substantial competition from hemostasis products currently marketed or presently under development  including plasma derived thrombin 
in the united states  stand alone plasma derived thrombin products on the market include thrombin jmi  a bovine plasma derived thrombin sold by king pharmaceuticals  inc  and evithrom  a pooled human plasma derived thrombin made by omrix biopharmaceuticals  inc and marketed by ethicon  inc  a division of johnson johnson 
in addition  baxter international  inc is expected to soon market the gelfoam plus hemostasis kit  which is pfizer inc s gelfoam sterile sponge co packaged with human plasma derived thrombin 
further  a number of companies  including johnson johnson and baxter international  inc  currently market other hemostatic agents that may present additional competition to recothrom  including passive agents such as gelatin and collagen pads  as well as fibrin sealants and tissues glues 
despite the potential advantages of recothrom  we may be unsuccessful in competing against these well established companies 
further  even if our promotional efforts are successful  many hospitals will evaluate the entire product category in which recothrom falls through their respective pharmacy and therapeutic products processes  including performing comparisons between recothrom and its direct competitors 
the review cycle will vary between hospitals and  in any event  uptake of recothrom would be delayed 
in addition  the price of bovine plasma derived thrombin has increased significantly in recent years  effectively increasing the value of the thrombin market 
however  if increased competition results in price competition  the value of the thrombin market could be reduced  which would impair our business 
in addition to direct competition  recothrom will also have to compete against the promotional efforts for other products in order to be noticed by healthcare practitioners 
the level of promotional effort in the pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and medical device markets is substantial 
market acceptance of recothrom will be affected by the level of promotional effort that we are able to provide 
the level and quality of our promotional efforts will depend in part on our ability to train  deploy and retain an effective sales and marketing organization  as well as our ability to secure additional financing 
we cannot assure you that the level of promotional effort that we will be able to provide for recothrom or the levels of additional financing we are able to secure  if any  will be sufficient to obtain market acceptance of recothrom 
recothrom may not achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenues 
if recothrom fails to achieve market acceptance  our product sales and our ability to maintain our current levels of research  development and commercialization activities  as well as our ability to become profitable in the future  will be adversely affected 
many factors may affect the rate and level of market acceptance of recothrom  including the effectiveness of our product marketing  promotion  distribution  sales and pricing strategies and programs  and those of our competitors  our ability to provide acceptable evidence of the product s safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and convenience compared to that of competing products  the perception of physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the product s safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and convenience compared to that of alternative or competing products  the level of satisfaction with the product of surgeons and the medical community  clinical practice guidelines regarding topical hemostats published by professional organizations or specialty groups  the size of the market for recothrom and its rate of growth  
table of contents any publicity concerning the product or similar products  new data or adverse event information relating to the product or any similar products and any resulting regulatory action  regulatory constraints on  or delays in the review of  our product promotional materials and programs  our ability to satisfy post marketing safety surveillance responsibilities and safety reporting requirements  the results of clinical studies completed after initial fda approval  regulatory developments relating to the development  manufacture  commercialization or use of the product  the introduction  availability and acceptance of alternative or competing treatments  including lower priced products  the ability to gain formulary acceptance and favorable formulary positioning  our ability to supply recothrom to meet demand  the continued availability of third parties to manufacture and distribute the product on acceptable terms  and the continued ability to manufacture commercial scale quantities of the product successfully and on a timely basis  and the outcome of patent  product liability or other litigation  if any  related to the product 
the approved product labeling and fda restrictions on promotional communications may adversely affect market acceptance of recothrom 
we believe that the approved product labeling for recothrom will have a direct and significant impact on our marketing  promotional and sales programs for this product  and could adversely affect market acceptance of this product 
the label contains warnings and contraindications that are typical for thrombin and recombinant products  as well as some that are unique to recothrom 
while we hope customers will prefer the inherent properties of a recombinant product to plasma derived alternatives  the label does not state that recothrom has demonstrated superior safety or efficacy to competing thrombin products 
if potential purchasers or those influencing purchasing decisions  such as physicians and pharmacists  react negatively to the product because of how they perceive the approved product labeling  it may result in lower product acceptance and lower product revenues 
in addition to approving product labeling  the fda typically reviews and provides advisory comments regarding core promotional materials for a pharmaceutical product 
the fda reviewed our core promotional materials in connection with the launch of recothrom in january  and we must submit all additional promotional materials to the fda at the time of their first use 
if the fda raises concerns regarding our promotional materials or messages  we may be required to modify or discontinue using them  and in some cases could be required to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners 
we do not know whether our promotional materials or messages will allow us to effectively promote recothrom with healthcare practitioners 
for example  the approved product labeling states that in the pivotal clinical trial we observed a lower incidence of immunogenicity of recothrom compared with that of bovine thrombin  but that there is no demonstrated correlation of this finding to clinical outcome 
accordingly  these regulatory limitations may make it difficult for us to address all potential questions and concerns regarding the product or its label  which could result in lower product acceptance and lower product sales 
a lack of familiarity with recothrom and our company may adversely affect market acceptance of recothrom 
we may be hampered in our promotional efforts by a lack of familiarity with recothrom and our company among healthcare practitioners in the united states 
relatively few united states physicians served as 
table of contents clinical investigators in the clinical studies of recothrom  as a result  only a limited number of united states healthcare practitioners are familiar with using recothrom  even in a clinical trial setting 
furthermore  because recothrom is our first product introduced commercially  there is limited  if any  awareness and goodwill associated with our company s name 
healthcare providers may prefer products from companies with which they have long standing relationships 
any or all of these factors may result in less market acceptance and lower sales of recothrom 
if bayer healthcare  upon whom we rely to co promote recothrom and provide additional medical science liaisons  fails to perform  our business may be adversely affected 
in june  we entered into an agreement with bayer healthcare llc whereby bayer healthcare agreed to co promote recothrom and provide additional medical science liaisons in the united states for a limited time 
much of our success in selling recothrom depends on the efforts of bayer healthcare 
collaboration with bayer healthcare in this regard involves certain risks  including  but not limited to  risks that bayer healthcare will not effectively co promote recothrom  not provide effective medical science liaisons  or not devote the resources or effort necessary to successfully co promote recothrom according to our business plan 
any such failure may result in decreased product sales and negatively affect our reputation and that of recothrom  which would harm our business 
if we or others identify unknown side effects of recothrom or if known side effects become a greater concern or product manufacturing problems occur  our business would be adversely affected and could lead the fda to withdraw marketing approval or a significant decrease in sales of recothrom could occur 
if we or others identify previously unknown side effects for recothrom or any products perceived to be similar to recothrom  or if any already known side effect becomes a more serious or frequent concern than was previously expected on the basis of new data or other developments  or if serious product manufacturing problems occur  then in any of these circumstances sales of recothrom may decrease significantly  regulatory approvals for recothrom may be restricted or withdrawn  we may decide to  or be required to  send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians  pharmacists and hospitals  reformulation of the product  additional preclinical or clinical studies  changes in labeling of the product or changes to or re approvals of manufacturing facilities may be required  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and investigations and lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us 
any of the above occurrences would harm or prevent sales of recothrom  increase our costs and expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize recothrom 
furthermore  now that recothrom is approved in the united states  the product is being used in a wider population and in a less rigorously controlled fashion than in clinical studies of the product 
it is expected that some patients exposed to recothrom will become sick or die suddenly  that in some or even many of these cases there will not be sufficient information available to rule out recothrom as a contributing factor or 
table of contents cause of sickness or mortality  and that safety reporting from physicians or from us to regulatory authorities may link recothrom to death or other serious adverse effects 
as a result  regulatory authorities  healthcare practitioners  third party payors or patients may perceive or conclude that the use of recothrom is associated with death or other serious adverse effects  any of which could mean that our ability to commercialize recothrom could be adversely affected and our business could be otherwise impaired 
in addition  now that recothrom is approved  others are free to generate new data regarding the product  which they may publish in the scientific literature or otherwise publicize  without our control 
distribution of recothrom will be highly concentrated among a small group of wholesale drug distributors and we rely on these wholesale drug distributors for certain crucial functions 
we will distribute recothrom through a small number of large wholesale drug distributors amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health  inc and mckesson corporation  which control a significant share of the pharmaceutical market in the united states 
our ability to distribute recothrom to hospital pharmacies and to recognize revenues on a timely basis will be substantially dependent on our ability to maintain commercially reasonable agreements with each of these wholesale distributors and the extent to which these distributors  over whom we have no control  comply with such agreements 
the loss or bankruptcy of any of these distributors could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations  financial condition and our ability to distribute our products 
further  we rely on our distributors to provide us with accurate and timely information regarding their inventories or complaints about recothrom 
if they fail to provide this information  our business may be significantly harmed 
guidelines  recommendations and other literature published by various organizations may affect the use of recothrom 
government agencies issue regulations and guidelines potentially directly applicable to us and to recothrom 
in addition  professional societies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in various diseases and conditions from time to time publish guidelines  recommendations and other literature to the healthcare and patient communities 
these types of publications may relate to such matters as product usage  dosage  route of administration  and use of related or competing products 
these organizations have in the past made recommendations about recothrom or products that compete with recothrom  such as the treatment guidelines of the society of thoracic surgeons 
these types of publications could result in decreased use of recothrom 
in addition  the perception by the investment community or shareholders that any such publication could result in decreased use of recothrom could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
recothrom has not been approved for sale outside of the united states  and may never receive foreign marketing approval 
in june  we and bayer schering pharma ag entered into a license and collaboration agreement under which bayer schering agreed to seek applicable government approvals for and develop and market recothrom outside the united states 
while the fda granted marketing approval in january  we and bayer schering do not know whether foreign regulatory authorities will grant marketing approval to recothrom as a topical hemostat 
in the united states  recothrom was approved by the fda for use as a topical hemostat on the basis of clinical studies showing non inferiority to bovine thrombin 
the european medicines agency emea and other regulatory authorities may require other clinical trials having a different study design  especially as bovine thrombin is not currently approved in europe 
in addition  the foreign regulatory authorities may not be satisfied with the safety and efficacy data submitted in support of the foreign applications  which could result in either non approval or a requirement of additional clinical trials or further 
table of contents analysis of existing data 
furthermore  as an element of the foreign approval process  the applicable regulatory authority must be satisfied with the processes and facilities for the manufacture of recothrom  which includes a physical inspection of those facilities 
any conclusion that there are shortcomings in the processes  facilities  quality control or oversight of contract manufacturers  or other quality assurance procedures related to manufacture of the drug could result in a significant delay in or failure to receive foreign approval 
lack of or limited marketing approval in a particular country could prevent or limit bayer schering from selling recothrom in that country  which could significantly harm our business 
we will be dependent on the efforts of bayer schering to market and promote recothrom in countries outside the united states where recothrom may receive approval  and we may otherwise be limited due to our relationship with bayer 
under our license and collaboration agreement with bayer schering  we will be dependent solely on bayer schering to promote and market recothrom in countries outside the united states where recothrom is approved 
in exchange  we will receive milestone payments and royalties on sales of recothrom 
we have limited ability to direct bayer schering in its promotion of recothrom in foreign countries 
bayer schering may not have sufficient experience to promote topical hemostat products in foreign countries and may fail to devote appropriate resources to this task 
no form of thrombin is currently sold in europe and  therefore  bayer schering will have to create a new market for recothrom  an endeavor in which it may fail 
if bayer schering fails to effectively promote recothrom in foreign countries  we may be unable to obtain any remedy against bayer schering 
if this were to happen  sales of recothrom in any foreign countries where recothrom is approved may be harmed  which would negatively impact our business 
further  pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement  we granted to bayer schering certain license rights to recothrom line extensions  if any 
we retained the right to co develop recothrom line extensions and the exclusive right to commercialize them in the united states  however  bayer schering has the ability to license the full rights to these line extensions outside the united states  and even if it does not elect to do so  we will not be permitted to commercialize any recothrom line extensions outside of the united states 
overall  our agreement with bayer schering may limit the financial benefits we may derive from recothrom line extensions  if any  by precluding us from markets in countries outside the united states  limit the financial benefits we may derive from recothrom line extensions  if any  by allowing bayer schering to license them in exchange for predetermined payments and royalties and with predetermined cost sharing arrangements  which payments and royalty rates may be less than  and which cost sharing arrangements may be less favorable to us than  terms we might otherwise obtain in collaborative or licensing arrangements with other parties  result in a delay in developing one or more recothrom line extensions due to bayer schering s internal procedures or development strategies  and prevent us from collaborating with or licensing a line extension candidate to another company that  by virtue of its particular skills and capabilities  may be a more desirable collaborator or licensing partner for that particular line extension candidate than bayer schering 
we have limited composition of matter patent protection for recothrom 
while we hold patents to the manufacture of recothrom  we have limited composition of matter patent protection to a recombinant precursor to recothrom 
accordingly  we may not be able to prevent other parties from developing alternate methods of manufacturing recothrom or from selling recothrom 
if a 
table of contents third party developed an alternate method of manufacturing recothrom and sold it  it would impair our business 
certain third parties hold patents relating to thrombin 
we are aware of certain united states and european patents and patent applications held by third parties relating to thrombin and to methods of manufacture of thrombin 
our analyses of these patents lead us to conclude that we will not infringe these patents and that many of the claims of these patents are invalid or unenforceable  however  the patent holders  courts or other governmental or legal entities may conclude that our products and or actions in developing or selling products do infringe such patents 
we may seek licenses to such patents if  in our judgment  such licenses are needed 
if any licenses are required  we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
if these licenses are not obtained  we might be prevented from using certain of our technologies for the generation of our products 
our failure to obtain a license to any technology that we may require may severely harm our business 
if we desire a license and are unable to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may be restricted in our ability to make  import and sell recothrom using third party patented technology 
we rely on third parties to supply recothrom and our other product candidates  therefore  we may not be able to effectively control production or obtain adequate supplies  which could cause delays in product manufacturing  subject us to product shortages or reduce product sales 
the manufacture and delivery of sufficient quantities of pharmaceutical products and devices is a time consuming and complex process 
except for limited capabilities to produce protein product candidates for clinical trials  we currently have no internal manufacturing capabilities 
in order to successfully commercialize our products  including recothrom  and continue to develop our product candidates  including line extensions for recothrom  atacicept and il  we need to contract or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing 
for example  we have entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories for commercial scale production of recothrom bulk drug substance and an agreement with patheon italia spa  inc for fill and finish of the dosage form of recothrom 
we have also entered into agreements with several suppliers of critical raw materials  manufacturing process intermediates and components for recothrom 
for our atacicept product candidate  we rely on our collaborative partner merck serono to manufacture supplies for clinical trials and  if approved  commercial sales 
for our il product candidate  novo nordisk will manufacture supplies for use in clinical trials 
reliance on third party manufacturers and other vendors limits our control regarding many aspects of the manufacturing and delivery processes and therefore exposes us to a variety of significant risks relating to our ability to commercialize our products or conduct clinical trials including  for example  due to contractual provisions allocating supplies in the event of a shortage  reliance on third parties for legal and regulatory compliance and quality assurance  third party refusals to supply on a long term basis  third party insistence on minimum and or maximum levels of supply and related restrictions on our ability to increase or decrease supply  breach of agreements by third parties  and termination or non renewal of agreements by third parties  based on other business priorities  at times that are costly or inconvenient for us 
furthermore  the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers will be periodically inspected by the fda 
a manufacturer s failure to satisfy regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of fda approval for that facility  including those used in the production of recothrom 
in complying with fda regulations  we 
table of contents and our contract manufacturers will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality assurance to assure that our products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
if any of these risks occur  our product supply could be interrupted resulting in lost or delayed revenues or delayed clinical trials or production costs could be significantly increased 
in addition  if  for any reason  we are required to engage an additional or replacement manufacturer or other vendor  the investment of funds and management time could be significant 
the cost and time to establish these new manufacturing facilities would be substantial 
as a result  using a new manufacturer or other vendor could disrupt our ability to market our products  subject us to product shortages  reduce product sales  and or reduce our profit margins 
further  any delay or disruption in the manufacturing of bulk product  the dosage form of our products or other product components  including spray applicators for delivery of recothrom  could also harm our reputation in the medical community 
overall  while we believe that business relations between us and our manufacturers and other supply chain vendors are generally good  we cannot predict whether any of the manufacturers and other vendors that we may use will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness for the manufacture of recothrom  its intermediates or components or for our other product candidates 
therefore  our dependence on third parties for the manufacture and delivery of products may adversely affect our business  including our ability to develop and deliver products in a timely and profitable manner 
there are limited numbers of potential manufacturers and other vendors on whom we could rely to supply recothrom and our other product candidates 
there are a limited number of manufacturers and other vendors that operate under the fda s cgmp regulations capable of manufacturing for us  and we have not established backup manufacturers and suppliers for recothrom or any of our product candidates 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain third party manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms  or if we lose a significant supplier used for recothrom  its line extensions  if any  or for our other product candidates  we may not be able to market our products  meet certain contractual supply obligations or complete development of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
for example  under our agreements with bayer  we are required to provide bayer with recothrom and may be in violation of the agreement if we cannot make the required deliveries 
in addition  some of the inventions and patents licensed to us were initially developed at universities or other not for profit institutions with funding support from an agency of the united states government 
in accordance with federal law  our licensees or we may be required to manufacture in the united states products covered by those patents  unless we can obtain a waiver from the government on the basis that such domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible 
we have not attempted to secure any such waivers from the government  and do not know if they would be sought or available if sought 
if we are not able to obtain such waivers  if requested  on a timely basis  we might be forced to seek manufacturing arrangements at higher prices  or on otherwise less favorable terms  than might be available to us in the absence of this domestic manufacturing requirement 
failure to effectively manage the recothrom supply chain could result in inventory shortages or other supply interruptions 
our supply chain for recothrom  its intermediates and components  is particularly complex and involves a number of third parties in several countries 
in addition  our contract manufacturers and other vendors have not produced recothrom  its intermediates or components  for commercial use for a sustained period of time 
as such  unforeseeable risks may be encountered as we  together with our manufacturers and other vendors  continue to develop familiarity and experience with regard to manufacturing recothrom  its intermediates and components 
failure to adequately manage our supply chain could result in inventory shortages or other 
table of contents supply interruptions that could negatively impact recothrom sales and  consequently  negatively impact product revenue 
as we progress from a primarily research and development company to a company increasingly involved in commercialization of products  we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations 
as we begin to commercialize recothrom and continue to advance product candidates through clinical trials and on to commercialization  we will need to expand our development and commercial operations capabilities 
if we are not able to provide these capabilities internally  we will need to rely on collaborative partners or other third parties to provide these services for us 
expanded operations will add significant complexity to our business and responsibilities to certain members of our management and key personnel 
we will need to manage relationships with an increasing number of collaborative partners  suppliers and third party contractors 
if we are unable to successfully provide the required infrastructure  either internally or through third parties  and successfully manage an increasing number of relationships  we will have difficulty growing our business 
we have rapidly expanded our field force operations  including sales personnel and medical science liaisons  and any difficulties managing these functions or the related growth could disrupt our operations 
during  in anticipation of the commercial launch of recothrom in the united states  we rapidly expanded and developed our field force operations  including sales personnel and medical science liaisons  which included  for the first time  hiring employees based outside of our washington state headquarters 
we increased expenditures in these areas  hiring additional employees and expanding the scope of our operations 
since we did not have any products approved for sale prior to january  our field force operations  and our ability to manage them  have been generally untested 
accordingly  if we are unable to effectively manage our newly expanded field force operations  or if our related capabilities prove to be inadequate  we may not be able to effectively implement our business plan 
we have limited experience in developing or commercializing products and may not be successful in commercializing recothrom or developing or commercializing any other products 
we have limited experience developing or commercializing products on our own 
we may not succeed in commercializing recothrom 
our other product candidates  which we are developing on our own or in collaboration with partners  have not yet completed clinical testing 
in addition  our contributions to the discovery or development of certain therapeutic proteins currently on the market do not imply that we will be able to successfully develop and market products alone 
our work relating to these marketed products generally did not include clinical trials or manufacturing  and we did not participate in marketing or other late stage development or commercialization activities 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize recothrom  or if we are significantly limited in doing so  our business will be materially harmed 
we may be unable to satisfy the rigorous government regulations relating to the development and marketing approval of our other product candidates 
the successful commercialization of atacicept  il  peg ifn lambda or any of our other product candidates will depend on obtaining marketing approval from the applicable regulatory authorities in each market in which we or our collaborators or our licensees intend to market the product candidates 
any failure to receive the marketing approvals necessary to commercialize atacicept or any of our other product candidates could severely harm our business 
our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation 

table of contents the fda regulates  among other things  the collection  testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  potency  labeling  storage  record keeping  quality systems  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of therapeutic products 
if our potential products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
except for recothrom in the united states  none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in any country  and our experience in filing and pursuing applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals is limited 
the regulatory review and approval process of governmental authorities  which includes nonclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
for example  securing fda approval requires the submission of extensive nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish the product candidate s safety and effectiveness  including significant information regarding the chemistry  manufacturing and controls or the product 
the approval process typically takes many years to complete and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing clinical studies 
in addition  we may not achieve governmental approval  including that of the fda  of a product candidate even if we have met our internal safety and efficacy criteria and completed clinical trials 
also  any fda or other regulatory approval of our product candidates  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
government regulation may result in prohibitions or significant delays in the marketing of potential products  recalls and discontinuation of the marketing of potential products  and limitations of the indicated uses for which potential products may be marketed 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business  we may be subject to sanctions  including the temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls  marketing restrictions and civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  some of our product candidates may be approved for use in combination with other products that are not our own 
failure by any of these products to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to their business  resulting in potential product restrictions or recalls  may materially harm our ability to successfully commercialize and generate revenues from our products used in combination regimens 
clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval 
clinical trials involving atacicept  il  peg ifn lambda or any of our other product candidates may reveal that those candidates are ineffective  have unacceptable toxicity or safety profiles or have other unacceptable side effects 
in addition  data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
likewise  the results of preliminary studies do not predict clinical success  and larger and later stage clinical trials may not produce the same results as earlier stage trials 
frequently  product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials have subsequently suffered significant setbacks in later clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts for these product candidates 
for example  while we have entered into a spa with the fda for atacicept that sets forth an agreement on key design issues of the pivotal clinical studies  this does not guarantee regulatory approval 
for example  we may not receive approval as a result of technical failure of the clinical studies such as inadequate data to support the agreed upon endpoint 
in addition  the fda may change the agreement set forth in the spa if the fda reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety and efficacy of atacicept is identified after the pivotal testing began 
if the fda changed the agreement set forth in a spa for atacicept it might delay the approval of atacicept or prevent it all together  which would impair our business 

table of contents we may be subject to product liability claims  which our limited product liability insurance may not adequately cover 
the manufacture and sale of therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity  even if the claims relate to use of the product in a manner inconsistent with label instructions 
in addition  recothrom will be used on patients undergoing surgery  where there are significant risks to patients 
we currently have only limited product liability insurance 
we do not know if we will be able to maintain existing or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
this type of insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we may be unable to continue to develop or commercialize recothrom or any other product candidates 
any product liability claims  whether or not ultimately successful  could have a material negative effect on our stock price  the market acceptance and sales of recothrom and our financial condition and results 
our use of collaborations to leverage our capabilities may not be successful 
as part of our business strategy  we have entered into collaboration arrangements with strategic partners to co develop and co commercialize products and product candidates and will continue to evaluate similar opportunities 
for our collaboration efforts to be successful  we must identify partners whose competencies and priorities complement ours 
we must also successfully enter into collaboration agreements with them on terms attractive to us and integrate and coordinate their resources and capabilities with our own on a continuing basis 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into collaboration agreements with acceptable partners or negotiating favorable terms in these agreements or maintaining such relationships so as to reap benefits from them over time 
also  we may be unsuccessful in integrating the resources  capabilities or priorities of these collaborators on a continuing basis 
in addition  our collaborators may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected 
if we are unsuccessful in our collaborative efforts  our ability to develop and market product candidates could be severely limited 
we may not be able to generate any revenue from product candidates developed by collaborators or licensees if they do not successfully develop those candidates 
we may be unable to derive any value from product candidates developed by collaborators or licensees  including novo nordisk  merck serono and bayer schering 
our ability to generate revenues from existing or future collaborations and license arrangements is subject to numerous risks  including the possibility that our collaborators or licensees lack sufficient financial  technical or other capabilities to develop these product candidates  the possibility that our collaborators or licensees choose to scale back or discontinue their development activities due to changes in their strategies  restructuring  mergers or acquisitions for example  novo nordisk has terminated its license to peg ifn lambda that it was granted pursuant to the option and license agreement  the length of time that it takes for our collaborators or licensees to solve technical problems or achieve various clinical development and regulatory approval milestones  the inability of collaborators or licensees to successfully address any regulatory or technical challenges they may encounter  and the possibility that these product candidates may not be effective or may prove to have undesirable side effects  unacceptable toxicities or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 

table of contents merck serono has substantial rights to license proteins we discover  which may limit our ability to pursue other collaboration or licensing arrangements or maximize the benefit from our discoveries 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with serono sa  which was subsequently acquired by merck kgaa and became merck serono sa  an affiliate of merck kgaa 
pursuant to this agreement  we granted options to license certain rights to proteins in our research pipeline 
although we retained the rights to co develop and co commercialize the licensed proteins in the united states  merck serono has at least half interest in the united states rights and full rights to these proteins outside the united states 
merck serono has licenses to four proteins as part of the strategic alliance  for two of which we elected to pursue co development  and it may license other proteins in the future pursuant to this agreement 
our agreement with merck serono may preclude or delay opportunities to seek other collaborators for our product candidates  due to the fact that we cannot explore other collaboration opportunities relating to proteins subject to the agreements until after merck serono has decided not to exercise an option with respect to the protein  limit the financial benefits we may derive from product candidates by allowing merck serono to license proteins in exchange for predetermined payments and royalties and with predetermined cost sharing arrangements  which payments and royalty rates may be less than  and which cost sharing arrangements may be less favorable to us than  terms we might otherwise obtain in collaborative or licensing arrangements with other parties  result in a delay in developing one or more product candidates due to merck serono s internal procedures or development strategies  result in merck serono licensing proteins with the most therapeutic and commercial potential  leaving us with fewer or less desirable product candidates to develop on our own or with other potential collaborators  and prevent us from collaborating with or licensing a product candidate to another company that  by virtue of its particular skills and capabilities  may be a more desirable collaborator or licensing partner for that particular product candidate than merck serono 
if we decide to build or acquire our own commercial manufacturing capacity  the process will be expensive  lengthy and would require compliance with extensive manufacturing regulations  which could not be assured 
therapeutic proteins are often more difficult and expensive to manufacture than other classes of drugs  and their manufacture requires specialized facilities 
we completed construction in of an expanded research and development facility that includes dedicated pilot scale gmp manufacturing suites for the production of therapeutic proteins for use in nonclinical and clinical testing 
in  we produced our first gmp materials in this facility 
these initial manufacturing suites will not provide us with the capability to produce drug materials for commercial sale 
although we are operating our pilot scale manufacturing suites in accordance with cgmp regulations  this facility has never been inspected by regulatory authorities 
if we decide to develop our own commercial manufacturing capability  we would need to acquire larger manufacturing facilities  which are very expensive and require extended periods of time to build and validate 
also  we would be required to adhere to rigorous cgmp regulations in this facility 
if any of our future facilities or quality systems could not pass pre approval facilities inspection  the fda marketing approval of our product candidates may not be granted  similarly  if we fail subsequent periodic facilities inspections  fda marketing approval could be withdrawn 
in building additional facilities and complying with these regulations and any applicable foreign regulatory requirements  we would be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality assurance to assure that our potential products meet applicable specifications and other requirements 
any failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to regulatory sanctions and delay or interrupt our development and commercialization efforts 

table of contents because we will depend on third parties to conduct certain laboratory tests and clinical trials  we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop product candidates 
we commonly rely on third parties to conduct laboratory tests and clinical trials for us  especially to the extent clinical trials include sites outside the united states 
if we are unable to obtain these services on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
also  because we will rely on third parties to some extent for laboratory tests and clinical trials  we may lose some control over these activities or be unable to manage them appropriately  or may become too dependent on these parties 
these third parties may not complete the tests or trials on schedule or when we request  and the tests or trials may be methodologically flawed  may not comply with applicable laws or be otherwise defective 
any delays or difficulties associated with third party laboratory tests or clinical trials may delay the development of our product candidates 
we have shifted our discovery efforts to therapeutic antibodies with which we have limited experience and face competition 
we have shifted our discovery efforts to focus on developing therapeutic antibodies 
we have limited experience developing antibodies and may not be successful in these efforts 
in addition  there is a great deal of competition in the field of antibody products 
our competitors include multinational pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms and universities and other research institutions 
a number of our largest competitors  including genentech  inc  amgen inc 
and human genome sciences  inc  are pursuing the development or marketing of pharmaceuticals that address the same diseases that we are pursuing  and it is possible that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for these diseases will increase 
we may be unable to commercialize antibody products 
we have shifted our research and discovery efforts toward developing therapeutic antibodies 
we may not be successful in obtaining adequate  if any  patent coverage for our discoveries and therapeutic antibody products 
in addition  there is a great deal of competition in the field of antibody products and third parties may own key technology patents or dominating patents that may prevent us from developing  manufacturing or commercializing therapeutic antibodies 
for example  we are aware of broad patents owned by others relating to the discovery  development  manufacture  use and sale of recombinant humanized antibodies  recombinant humanized single chain antibodies  recombinant human antibodies  and recombinant human single chain antibodies and other technologies 
many of our product candidates may use or include such technologies 
however  we may not be able to obtain necessary rights to key technologies needed for the discovery  development  production or commercialization of therapeutic antibodies through licensing agreements on terms attractive to us  if at all 
if these licenses are not obtained  we might be prevented from using certain of our technologies for the generation and development of our new discoveries 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to obtain needed licenses  our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates derived from these new discoveries could be severely limited 
any patent infringement or other legal claims that might be brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
if our research and development programs fail to result in additional product candidates  our potential to generate revenue will be substantially limited 
our product candidates being developed in our research and development programs are at a relatively early stages and will require significant research  development  preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing scale up activities  regulatory approval and or commitments of significant resources before commercialization 
we cannot predict whether our efforts will lead to the discovery and development of any additional product candidates that could generate revenues for us 

table of contents the failure to attract or retain key management or other personnel could decrease our ability to discover  develop and commercialize potential products 
we depend on our senior executive officers as well as key scientific  management and other personnel 
only a small number of our key personnel are bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we have not purchased key person life insurance policies for any of our executive officers or key personnel 
competition for scientists and other qualified employees is intense among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the loss of qualified employees  or an inability to attract  retain and motivate the additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our activities  could hinder our ability to discover  develop and commercialize potential products 
we may expand our business through the acquisition of companies or businesses or in licensing product candidates that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
we may in the future seek to expand our products and capabilities by acquiring one or more companies or businesses or in licensing one or more product candidates 
acquisitions and in licenses involve numerous risks  including substantial cash expenditures  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify at the time of acquisition  difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired companies  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies or businesses 
historically  we have not expanded our business through acquisition or in licensing and  therefore  our experience in making acquisitions and in licensing is limited 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or in license will result in short term or long term benefits to us 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or in licensed product candidate 
in addition  our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions and in licenses 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies or in licensed product candidates work or be successful 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or company or in licensed product candidate may require a substantial capital investment by us 
we may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our capital stock  which could dilute our current shareholders ownership interest  or securities convertible into our capital stock  which could dilute current shareholders ownership interest upon conversion 
our patents and patent applications may not result in meaningful protection against competitors  provide us with any competitive advantage  or provide adequate protection or rights for new discoveries  and our competitors may commercialize the discoveries we patent or attempt to patent 
we own or hold exclusive rights to many issued united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications related to the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates 
these patents and applications cover composition of matter for genes  proteins  and antibodies  medical indications  methods of use  methods of making  formulations  technologies and other inventions related to therapeutic proteins and antibodies 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates in the united states and other countries  and our ability to obtain patents to future discoveries 

table of contents although we diligently seek to identify and protect our important discoveries and inventions  we may fail to file timely patent applications 
we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
our pending and future patent applications covering products and product candidates may not meet the statutory requirements for patentability  meaning that our applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  and  if issued as patents  such patents may not be enforceable against a competitor 
our rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise cover commercially valuable products or processes 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for eighteen months after the filing of the applications  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be sure that the inventors of subject matter covered by our patents and patent applications were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
our patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
although we have a number of issued patents  the discoveries or technologies covered by these patents may not have any value 
these issued patents may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors  nor may they provide all rights necessary to commercialize our products or product candidates 
in addition  we may not be able to or allowed to obtain patent term extension or restoration on patents covering our products in a manner that would provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors 
while we have a number of issued patents  the discoveries or technologies covered by these patents may not have any therapeutic or commercial value 
also  our patents may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors 
other parties may have a dominating patent position covering a composition of matter  or discover alternative uses  for our products or product candidates  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
in addition  other parties may be able to design around our issued patents or independently develop products having effects similar or identical to our patented product candidates 
the business model of some companies is to design around patented marketed protein based products by altering the amino acid sequence of the marketed product  thereby avoiding the patent  but maintaining functional equivalence 
similarly  it may be easier to develop equivalent versions of monoclonal antibodies and soluble receptors than to develop equivalent versions of the proteins with which they interact because there is often more than one antibody or receptor that can have the same therapeutic effect 
consequently  any existing or future patents we have that cover monoclonal antibodies or soluble receptors may not provide any meaningful protection against competitors 
in addition  other parties may discover uses for genes or proteins that are different from the uses described in our patents  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
if another party holds a patent on the use of a gene or protein  then even if we hold the patent covering the composition of matter of the gene or protein itself  that party might prevent us from promoting and selling any product directed to such use 
also  other parties may have patents covering the composition of matter of genes or proteins for which we have patents covering only methods of use or methods of manufacture 
furthermore  our patents on recombinant proteins or their precursors or methods of manufacturing such proteins  such as our patents covering the precursor to recothrom and its method of manufacture  may not prevent competitors from developing other precursors or methods of manufacturing these proteins 
third parties may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope  validity or enforceability 
third parties may initiate other proceedings to limit the scope  validity or enforceability of our patents  including but not limited to inter partes re examination proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  opposition proceedings in patent authorities outside of the united states  or in the event a third party independently develops intellectual property similar to ours  interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of discovery or invention 
likewise  we may initiate inter partes proceedings to challenge the scope  validity or enforceability of third party patents 
the outcome of any such proceeding is uncertain and could result in judicial determinations that our patents are invalid  limited in scope  not infringed  and or unenforceable  which would impair our business 
participating in such proceedings or other challenges  whether 
table of contents initiated by us or by third parties may require significant expenditures and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns  which may also impair our business 
third parties may infringe our patents 
competitors and other third parties may infringe our patents  or use inventions described in our patent applications 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to police third party activities and detect such infringement  for example  we may be unable to discover a competitor s manufacturing process to determine whether it infringes a patent claims to a method of manufacture 
patent litigation is very expensive and time consuming and is a distraction to management and personnel who are needed to supply evidence and support to litigation efforts 
enforcing our patents against third parties may require significant expenditures regardless of outcome 
for example  in august we filed a lawsuit against bristol myers squibb for infringement of our patents related to fusion protein technology 
the lawsuit  in which we are seeking injunctive relief and damages  was filed with the united states district court for the district of delaware  and is now at the stage of expert discovery 
we may incur substantial expenditures in this and other patent litigation  and although we intend to pursue our cases vigorously  the outcome of any lawsuit is uncertain 
further  challenges raised in patent infringement litigation initiated by us or by third parties may result in determinations that our patents have not been infringed or that they are invalid  unenforceable or otherwise subject to limitations 
consequently  third parties may be able to use the discoveries or technologies claimed or described in our patents without paying licensing fees or royalties to us  which could significantly diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our products and product candidates 
third parties may claim that our products or product candidates  or processes or related technologies infringe their patents 
the risk of infringement claims is likely to increase as other companies obtain more patents and increase their efforts to discover and develop proteins  antibodies and methods that may be similar to or compete with products and product candidates in our research and development pipeline 
furthermore  we may not have identified all united states and foreign patents that pose a risk of our infringement 
any patent infringement or other legal claims that might be brought against us may cause us to incur significant expenses  divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns and  if successfully asserted against us  require us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  as a result of a patent infringement suit  we may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling products or product candidates that are claimed to infringe a third party s patent unless that party grants us rights to use its intellectual property 
we may be unable to obtain these rights on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain rights to a third party s patented intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  allowing our competitors to obtain access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
patent protection for protein based therapeutic products and other biotechnology inventions is subject to a great deal of uncertainty  and if patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change  our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize products based on our discoveries 
patent protection for protein based therapeutic products is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
in recent year  there have been significant changes in patent law  including the legal standards that govern the scope of protein and biotechnology patents 
standards for patentability of full length and partial genes  and their corresponding proteins  are changing 
also  there is substantial uncertainty regarding the patentability of proteins without known function or specific correlation with diseases 
recent court decisions 
table of contents have made it more difficult to obtain patents  by making it more difficult to satisfy the requirement of non obviousness  have decreased the availability of injunctions against infringers  and have increased the likelihood of challenging the validity of a patent through a declaratory judgment action 
taken together  these decisions make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain  license and enforce our patents 
in addition  in recent years  several members of the united states congress have made numerous proposals to change the patent statute 
these proposals include measures that  among other things  would expand the ability of third parties to oppose united states patents  introduce the first to file standard to the united states patent system  and limit damages an infringer is required to pay 
if the patent statute is changed  the scope  validity and enforceability of our patents may be significantly decreased 
there also have been  and continue to be  policy discussions concerning the scope of patent protection awarded to biotechnology inventions 
social and political opposition to biotechnology patents may lead to narrower patent protection within the biotechnology industry 
social and political opposition to patents on genes and proteins may lead to narrower patent protection  or narrower claim interpretation  for genes  their corresponding proteins and inventions related to their use  formulation and manufacture 
patent protection relating to biotechnology products is also subject to a great deal of uncertainty outside the united states  and patent laws are evolving and undergoing revision in many countries 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws worldwide may result in our inability to obtain or enforce patents  and may allow others to use our discoveries to develop and commercialize competitive products  which would impair our business 
we expect to incur significant expenses in applying for patent protection and prosecuting our patent applications 
our success depends significantly on the establishment of patent protection for the products and product candidates in our research and development pipeline and related technologies we discover or invent 
consequently  we intend to continue our substantial efforts in applying for patent protection and prosecuting pending and future patent applications and maintaining patents 
these efforts have historically required the expenditure of considerable time and money  and we expect that they will continue to require significant expenditures 
we may fail to secure meaningful patent protection relating to any of our existing or future product candidates  discoveries or technologies despite the expenditure of considerable resources 
in addition  future changes in united states or foreign patent laws may complicate or hinder our efforts to obtain patent protection and may significantly increase the costs associated with patent prosecution 
we may be unable to protect our unpatented proprietary technology and information 
in addition to our patented intellectual property  we also rely on trade secrets and confidential information 
we may not be able to effectively protect our rights to such proprietary technology or information 
other parties may independently develop or gain access to equivalent technologies or information and disclose it for others to use 
disputes may arise about inventorship and corresponding rights to know how and inventions resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our corporate partners  licensees  scientific and academic collaborators and consultants 
in addition  confidentiality agreements and material transfer agreements we have entered into with these parties and with employees and advisors may not provide effective protection of our proprietary technology or information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  may not provide adequate remedies 
environmental and health and safety laws may result in liabilities  expenses and restrictions on our operations 
state and federal laws and regulations and those of foreign jurisdictions regarding environmental protection  hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business 
the use of hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental releases 
if our operations  including those of our strategic partners  result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances  we 
table of contents could be liable for damages and fines 
future changes to environmental and health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expenses or restrict our operations 
in addition  the site where our principal headquarters and facilities are located has been listed as a contaminated property by the state of washington due to its previous use by the city of seattle as an electricity generating plant 
the city of seattle has agreed to defend us against and indemnify us for any claims that arise from this pre existing contamination  except to the extent that we caused the claim through our negligence or intentional fault  or to the extent that we contributed to the contamination that is the subject of the claim  caused an increase in the clean up costs or failed to comply with our obligations under our agreement with the city of seattle 
this indemnity may be insufficient and we may be subject to environmental liabilities or be prohibited from using or occupying some or all of the property as a result of environmental claims 
natural or man made disasters may impair our ability to conduct our business 
while our headquarters and principal research and development operations are in seattle  washington  we also have partners  manufacturers  suppliers and distributors in various parts of the united states  europe and australia 
our facilities and those of our partners  manufacturers  suppliers or distributors may be subject to natural or man made disasters 
a natural or man made disaster could cause damage to our facility  personnel or equipment  which in turn  could cause us to cease or curtail operations 
our business and financial position may also be affected by disasters affecting the operations of one of our partners  manufacturers  suppliers or distributors 
disasters may include  but are not limited to earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  tsunamis  fires  floods  power loss  communication failures and other similar events  including the effects of war or acts of terrorism 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be seriously or completely impaired 
although we maintain insurance coverage for many of these types of risks  it may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
financial and market risks we anticipate incurring additional losses and may not achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years  and we may never become profitable 
although we began generating recothrom sales revenue in january  it will be a number of years before we generate revenues from sales of other potential products  if ever 
our revenues from the sales of recothrom and existing collaborative and licensing arrangements are currently insufficient to cover our operating expenses  and we may never generate revenues sufficient to cover these expenses 
in addition  we will continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research  development and commercialization efforts 
we anticipate that these expenses will increase as we focus on the laboratory tests and clinical trials required to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of products 
the development and commercialization of our product candidates will require significant further research  development  testing  regulatory approvals and sales and marketing activities  including  in the immediate future  pursuing the commercialization of recothrom 
we may not be able to complete such development or succeed in developing and commercializing products that will generate revenues that will justify the costs of development and commercialization 
we may not succeed in commercializing recothrom  or any other product candidate 
we may incur substantial operating losses for at least the next few years as we continue to expand our commercial function in the immediate future for recothrom and our research and development activities for the other product candidates in our development pipeline 
these losses have had and will have an adverse effect on our shareholders equity and working capital 
even if we become profitable in the future  we may not remain profitable 
if we do not obtain substantial additional funding on acceptable terms  we may not be able to continue to grow our business or generate enough revenue to recover our investment in research and development 
our business does not currently generate the cash needed to finance our operations  and we do not expect it to in the near future 
we anticipate that we will continue to expend substantial funds on our research and 
table of contents development programs  the amount of which may increase in the future 
we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  or through other arrangements  including collaborative and licensing arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be diluted  and these securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our research or development or commercialization programs 
we may also be required to grant rights to third parties to develop  commercialize and market products and product candidates that we would prefer to develop  commercialize and market internally  and such rights may be granted on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we were required to grant such rights  the ultimate value of these products or product candidates to us would be reduced 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future  even with the revenue generated by sales of our first product  recothrom  beginning in january our revenues have been unpredictable and will fluctuate due to the slow or erratic uptake of recothrom sales or the timing of licensing fees or the achievement of milestones under new or existing licensing and collaborative arrangements 
in addition  our expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenses  particularly with respect to contract manufacturing and clinical and nonclinical testing 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our past operating results are not good indicators of our future performance and should not be relied on to predict our future operating results 
it is possible that in the future our operating results in a particular quarter or quarters will not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing the market price of our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially 
we are exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
some of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and  even if they are not as a matter of contract  vendors may seek concessions in the event that their anticipated economic return is impaired by exchange rate fluctuations 
most of our existing foreign expenses are associated with the manufacture of recothrom  sharing of development costs with foreign partners or our global clinical studies 
we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates with europe 
when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the dollar strengthens against other currencies  the dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases 
consequently  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the united states dollar  may adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently do not hedge against our foreign currency risks 
risks related to our industry many of our competitors have substantially greater capabilities and resources than we do and may be able to develop and commercialize products before we do or more effectively than we do 
we may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we expect that competition in our field will continue to be intense 
recothrom and its line extensions  if any  will face substantial competition in the topical hemostat market from the current well established participants  including king pharmaceuticals  inc  ethicon  inc and baxter international  inc  as well as any future entrants into this market 
for our product candidates in development  we face competition from other entities involved in the research and development of therapeutic proteins  including genentech  inc  human genome sciences  inc  medarex  inc 
and biogen idec inc  among others 
we also face competition from entities developing other types 
table of contents of products related to particular diseases or medical conditions  including other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
furthermore  our potential products  if approved and commercialized  may compete against well established existing therapeutic protein based products  many of which may be currently reimbursed by government health administration authorities  private health insurers and health maintenance organizations 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial  scientific  marketing and human resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may succeed in identifying genes or proteins  or developing therapeutic protein based products  earlier than we do  obtain approvals for products from the fda or other regulatory agencies more rapidly than we do  obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates  develop treatments or cures that are safer or more effective than those we propose to develop  devote greater resources to marketing or selling their products  introduce or adapt more quickly to new technologies or scientific advances  which could render our discovery technologies obsolete  introduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical  withstand price competition more successfully than we can  more effectively negotiate third party collaborative or licensing arrangements  and take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily than we can 
because of these potential disadvantages  we may not be able to compete effectively with these competitors 
our products and product candidates  even if approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  may not achieve market acceptance among hospitals  insurers or patients 
our products and product candidates  even if approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  may fail to achieve market acceptance  which would impair our ability to become profitable 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and product candidates will depend on our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety  efficacy and limited side effects  our ability to provide these products and product candidates at reasonable prices  the availability of third party reimbursement for these products and product candidates  our ability to differentiate our products and compete effectively  including with products that are considered to be the standard of care  and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing capabilities 
if the healthcare system  reimbursement policies or any other healthcare related regulations change  the prices of our products and product candidates may fall or our potential sales may decline 
in recent years  officials have made numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states 
these proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control 
government and other third party payors increasingly have attempted to control healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of newly approved healthcare products 
increasingly  third party payors have been challenging 
table of contents the prices charged for products 
they may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the fda has granted marketing approval 
the government may adopt future legislative proposals  such as price controls on prescription drugs  and federal  state or private payors for healthcare goods and services may take further action to limit payments for healthcare products and services 
in addition  in certain foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control with many of the same types of challenges as in the united states 
any of these factors could limit our ability to successfully commercialize our potential products 
we may face increased competition from lower priced products re imported into the united states from canada and other countries 
the current law  enacted in december  allows the importation of drugs from canada  but only if the secretary of health and human services certifies that importation will pose no additional risk to the public s health and safety 
to date  no such certifications have been given 
legislative proposals have been made to change the law to allow importation without any certification 
if this or other new legislation or regulations were passed allowing the reimportation of drugs  it could adversely affect the prices of our potential products 
in addition  there has been much discussion regarding the creation of laws permitting follow on or generic versions of biologics 
while there is not currently an abbreviated approval pathway for biologics as there is with branded drugs  congress and the fda are studying the issue and there is increasing interest from the public 
an abbreviated pathway for follow on biologics may permit sponsors of follow on products to reference data submitted by innovator developers like ourselves and may not require full clinical trials  significantly lowering the financial barriers to entry 
the approval of follow on biologics could result in new and increased competition  including competition prior to expiration of our patents covering our products  and related litigation 
negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic and clinical research may limit our ability to conduct our business 
ethical  social and legal concerns about genetic and clinical research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting some of our activities or the activities of our suppliers and collaborators 
in recent years  federal and state agencies  congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating the biotechnology industry 
more restrictive regulations could delay nonclinical studies or future clinical trials  or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals or commercializing any products 
in addition  animal rights activists may protest our use of animals in research and development and may attempt to disrupt our operations  which could cause us to incur significant expenses and distract our management s attention from other business concerns 
the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products and biologics is subject to extensive regulation and aggressive government enforcement  and our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations 
our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products will be subject to extensive regulation under the us federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal statutes and associated regulations 
these laws and regulations limit the types of marketing claims and other communications we can make regarding marketed products 
we are also subject to various us federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
anti kickback laws prohibit payments of any kind intended to induce physicians or others either to purchase or arrange for or recommend the purchase of healthcare products or services  including the selection of a particular prescription drug 
these laws make certain business practices that are relatively common in other industries illegal in our industry 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting  or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent 
the government has 
table of contents asserted very broad interpretations of these laws against pharmaceutical manufacturers  even though these manufacturers did not directly submit claims for reimbursement to government payors 
violations of the above laws may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including fines and civil monetary penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs  including medicare and medicaid 
many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have in recent years been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation  including claims asserting violations of the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other violations in connection with off label promotion of products  pricing  and government price reporting 
while we will strive to comply with these complex requirements  the interpretation of these laws as applied to particular sales and marketing practices continues to evolve  and it is possible that our sales and marketing practices might be challenged 
further  although we have taken measures to prevent potential challenges  including through our corporate compliance program  we cannot guarantee that such measures will protect us from future challenges  lawsuits or investigations 
even if such challenges are without merit  they could cause adverse publicity  divert management attention and be costly to respond to  and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  including impact on our stock price 
in addition  our strategic partners and licensees are required to comply with comparably complex requirements in jurisdictions outside the united states 
for example  we may be required to prepare and report product pricing related information to federal and state governmental authorities  such as the veterans administration and under the medicaid program 
the calculations used to generate the pricing related information are complex and require the exercise of judgment 
if we fail to accurately and timely report product pricing related information or to comply with any of these or any other laws or regulations  various negative consequences could result  including criminal and or civil prosecution  substantial criminal and or civil penalties  exclusion of the approved product from coverage under governmental healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid  costly litigation and restatement of our financial statements 
in addition  our efforts to comply with this wide range of laws and regulations are  and will continue to be  time consuming and expensive 
we may be required to defend lawsuits and pay damages in connection with alleged or actual harm caused by our products and product candidates 
as we begin to commercialize products  we face an increased risk of litigation 
for example  with recothrom on the market  the risk of product liability claims will increase 
further  patent infringement claims involving recothrom will no longer be exempt under usc e  so we face increased risks of patent litigation 
our marketing and promotional efforts for recothrom could increase the risk of litigation based on claims of unfair competition 
for product candidates still in development  we face the risk of product liability claims in the event that the use of our product candidates in clinical trials is alleged to have resulted in harm to others 
we may incur significant expenses if any of these lawsuits against us were to be successful 
even if such lawsuits are without merit or otherwise unsuccessful  they could cause adverse publicity  divert management attention and be costly to respond to  and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  including negatively impacting our share price 
although we maintain product liability and general insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to cover such claims 
risks related to ownership of our stock our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors beyond our control  including changes in the recommendations of securities analysts or changes in their financial estimates of our operating results  recommendations or opinions of journalists  media personalities or market commentators  failures in meeting performance expectations of securities analysts or investors  
table of contents fluctuations in the valuations of companies perceived by securities analysts or investors to be comparable to us  and share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares 
furthermore  the stock markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies 
in particular  there have been high levels of volatility in the market prices of securities of biotechnology companies 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to our expected stock price volatility 
in the past  shareholders have often brought securities class action litigation against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us  because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
we may in the future be the target of securities class action litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  could divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our shareholders have significant control of our management and affairs  which they could exercise against other shareholders best interests 
novo nordisk  together with warburg pincus equity partners  lp  beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  representatives of these shareholders hold four out of nine seats on our board of directors pursuant to a shareholders agreement 
these shareholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence our management and affairs and matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as mergers  consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets 
consequently  these shareholders  acting together  may be able to cause a change in control  as well as delay or prevent a change in control 
they may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to effect a change in control  even if such a change in control would benefit our other shareholders 
provisions in washington law  our charter documents and executive employment agreements we have entered into may prevent  discourage or delay a change of control 
we are subject to the washington anti takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers  which  with limited exceptions  prohibit a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions for a period of five years after the share acquisition by an acquiring person  unless i the prohibited transaction or the acquiring person s purchase of shares was approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s board of directors prior to the acquiring person s share acquisition or ii the prohibited transaction was both approved by the majority of the members of the target corporation s board and authorized at a shareholder meeting by at least two thirds of the outstanding voting shares excluding the acquiring person s shares at or subsequent to the acquiring person s share acquisition 
an acquiring person is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns or more of the voting securities of the target corporation 
such prohibited transactions include  among other things certain mergers or consolidations with  dispositions of assets to  or issuances of stock to or redemptions of stock from  the acquiring person  
table of contents termination of or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person s acquisition of or more of the shares  allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder  and liquidating or dissolving the target corporation 
after the five year period  certain significant business transactions are permitted  as long as they comply with certain fair price provisions of the statute or are approved by a majority of the outstanding shares other than those of which the acquiring person has beneficial ownership 
a corporation may not opt out of this statute 
as such  these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or a change of control and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us 
in addition  our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions  such as undesignated preferred stock and prohibitions on cumulative voting in the election of directors  which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
also  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board  removal of directors generally only for cause and certain requirements for calling special shareholder meetings 
further  our bylaws require advance notice of shareholder proposals and nominations and impose restrictions on the persons who may call special shareholder meetings 
these provisions may have the effect of preventing or hindering any attempts by our shareholders to replace our current board of directors or management

adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  was made on january  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic protein based products for the treatment of human diseases 
the process for taking one of our discoveries to the marketplace is long  complex and very costly 
it is difficult to predict the time it will take to commercialize any given product candidate  but it would not be unusual to span ten years or more and cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
it is also a business of attrition  it is expected that  for the industry as a whole  less than of the drug candidates entering human clinical trials will actually make it to the marketplace 
for the products that do make it  particularly for those that address previously unmet medical needs  the markets can be significant  with a number of successful products selling in excess of billion per year 
an important element of our strategy is that we intend to maintain all or a significant share of the commercial rights to our commercial product  recothrom  and to a number of our product candidates in north american markets 
as a result  we will be required to pay a significant portion of the commercialization and development costs for recothrom and our product candidates 
a second important element of our strategy is that we are developing a broad portfolio of product candidates to give our company more opportunities to be successful 
we currently have one commercial product  recothrom  which was approved by the fda on january   and three product candidates in clinical development 
we expect to add additional product candidates to this portfolio in the future 
therefore  we are paying and expect to pay a significant portion of development costs for several potential product candidates 
assuming these product candidates progress through clinical development successfully  the costs of clinical trials are expected to increase significantly 
our most significant financial challenges are to obtain adequate funding to launch recothrom  cover the cost of product development  and to control spending and direct it toward product candidates that will create the most value for our shareholders over the long term 
it can be a complex and highly subjective process to establish the appropriate balance between cash conservation and value generation 
there are a number of important factors that we consider in addressing these challenges  including the following the nature  timing and magnitude of financing transactions  which would typically involve issuance of debt or equity or equity based securities  the nature and timing of product development collaborations  which would typically provide for funding of a portion of the respective product development costs  as well as bring in near term potential revenues in the form of upfront fees and milestone payments  the breadth of product development programs  ie  the number of potential disease indications for which a product candidate is tested in clinical trials  the number of products in our development portfolio and the decision to move new product candidates into clinical development  periodic assessments of the relative capital requirements  risk and value of each of our product candidates  the probability and timing of regulatory approval of drug candidates by the fda and other regulatory agencies  and the nature and timing of commercial product launches 
in late  we began preparations for the launch of rthrombin  which was approved by the fda on january  in june  we entered into a global collaboration with bayer for development and commercialization of rthrombin 
bayer has agreed to commercialize rthrombin in countries outside the united states and will co promote the product with us in the united states for three years 
we have hired approximately field personnel and additional headquarters based personnel to support the commercial operations that are 
table of contents necessary for the launch of rthrombin 
we are incurring launch related marketing costs to support the selling effort 
we are also building significant levels of inventory to ensure we can meet the expected demand for the product and minimize the risk of product shortages 
these launch related activities are requiring additional funding over and above that related to our development pipeline 
we anticipate significant revenue generation from recothrom sales over time  however  we cannot be certain of the rate of market penetration or when  if ever  our revenues will exceed our related costs 
we expect that it will be several years before we can generate enough product related revenues for our company to reach net income or cash flow breakeven  as we continue to use significant amounts of cash to develop our business 
revenues from our existing relationships help to defray our expenses  but additional funding will be required  the amount of which could be significant 
we may decide to enter into additional product development collaborations  which would reduce our funding requirements 
we may also generate funding through licensing of our patents 
it is likely that we will continue to look for opportunities to raise capital  either in the form of debt  equity or equity related capital as a means of funding our company over the next few years 
these opportunities may arise at any time  depending on things such as overall market conditions  dynamics in the biotechnology sector of the market  investor appetite for certain types of companies  and fundamental characteristics of our business 
at other times  it may be difficult to raise capital on terms favorable to our company  if at all 
accordingly  we expect to raise capital when it is available  not when there is an immediate need 
we believe this strategy is important to minimize the financial risks to our company and our shareholders 
results of operations revenues royalties 
we earn royalties on sales of certain products subject to license agreements with novo nordisk  our former parent and current owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock  and several other companies 
royalties have decreased steadily from primarily due to insulin and glucagon patent expiration in certain countries 
insulin and glucagon royalties declined to of our total royalty revenues in  down from in and in the downward trend will continue in as royalties for both insulin and glucagon in the remaining major markets have ended 
in and  increased royalties from sales of gem s  a product of biomimetic therapeutics  inc  partially offset the decrease in insulin and glucagon royalties 
option fees 
in september  we signed a five year strategic alliance agreement with serono sa now merck serono under which merck serono may acquire rights and licenses to certain leads and targets from our research and development pipeline 
we recorded revenue from this agreement of million for each of the years ended december   and we had a deferred revenue balance of million at december   which we expect to recognize at a rate of million per year 
option fee revenue of million for and million for was earned from novo nordisk under an option and license agreement  pursuant to which we granted an option to license certain rights to proteins that we discover 
this agreement expired in november  and we recognized no option fee revenue from that agreement following its expiration 
license fees  milestone payments and upfront fees 
we enter into various collaborative agreements that may generate significant license  option or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
where we have no continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon receipt  as these payments represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
where we have continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized using one of two methods 
where we are able to estimate the total amount of services under the arrangement  revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model 
costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs are used to determine proportional performance  as this is considered to be 
table of contents representative of the delivery of outputs under the arrangement 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to cash received and amounts contractually due 
changes in estimates of total expected performance are accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate 
where we cannot estimate the total amount of service that is to be provided  a time based method is used to recognize revenue 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period  starting with the contract s commencement  but not before the removal of any contingencies for each milestone 
proportional performance is determined based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the completed portion of the non contingent payments received or due 
from period to period  license fees and milestone payments can fluctuate substantially based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
revenue from license fees and milestone payments increased in to million as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to recognition in of license fee revenue related to the bayer agreement related to rthrombin  milestone payment revenue from novo nordisk on rfactor xiii  il and il  and milestone payment revenue from merck serono for atacicept and fgf no comparable amounts were earned for any of these arrangements in in june  we entered into license and collaboration and co promotion agreements with bayer 
the agreements provide bayer with an exclusive license to develop and sell rthrombin outside of the united states and bayer will also promote rthrombin in the united states for three years 
we will record all united states sales and bayer will be entitled to commissions on united states sales for five years 
we received a million upfront milestone payment in  a million milestone payment in february based upon the january  fda approval of rthrombin  million of which will be repaid to bayer as united states sales bonuses under the co promotion and may receive additional payments of up to million based on regulatory filings  approvals and annual sales thresholds achieved by bayer outside of the united states 
these milestone payments will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as we fulfill our obligations under the agreements 
we currently anticipate completing these obligations in early revenue from license fees and milestone payments decreased in to million as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the completion of the novo nordisk rfactor xiii license fee revenue recognition period in may as compared to a full year recognition period during in addition  milestone payment revenue was recorded in for rfactor xiii from novo nordisk and pdgf from biomimetic therapeutics  inc  for which no comparable amounts were earned in also  in we licensed certain protein c patents to eli lilly and company in exchange for a non refundable upfront fee 
under our arrangement with eli lilly and company  we have no continuing performance obligations 
as a result  we recognized the upfront license fee as revenue in there was no comparable amount earned in at december   million related to collaboration agreements was recorded as deferred revenue  which we currently expect to be recognized in future periods as follows in thousands thereafter total product revenue 
we began recognizing recothrom product revenue early in the first quarter of  following fda approval on january  
table of contents operating expenses research and development expense 
research and development expense has been our most significant expense to date  consisting of salaries and benefit expenses  costs of consumables  contracted services and stock based compensation 
our research and development activities have generally been expanding  particularly related to our recently approved commercial product  recothrom  and clinical stage product candidates  atacicept  il and peg ifn l 
in addition  the impact of recognizing stock based compensation cost in and with the adoption of fas r has further increased our research and development expenses as compared to in each of the past three years  research and development expense was partially offset by cost reimbursements from novo nordisk and merck serono for work performed on various development programs 
additionally  cost reimbursements from bayer were recorded in the breakdown within major categories of research and development expense are shown in the following table in thousands 
salaries and benefits consumables facility costs contracted services depreciation and amortization stock based compensation subtotal cost reimbursement from collaborators net research and development expense salaries and benefits  consumables and facility costs  generally track with changes in our employee base from year to year 
over the past three years  we have added approximately full time equivalent employees who are involved in product development activities 
in february  the company reduced its research and development staff by approximately people 
contracted services include the cost of items such as contract manufacturing  clinical trials  non clinical studies and payments to collaborators 
these costs relate primarily to clinical development programs and can fluctuate substantially from period to period depending on the stage of our various programs 
generally  these external costs increase as a program advances toward commercialization  but there can be periods between major clinical trials or manufacturing campaigns during which costs decline 
clinical trial costs slightly decreased in  as compared to the same period in  primarily reflecting the completion of rthrombin phase clinical trials prior to our fda submission in late  partially offset by the increase in preparation costs associated with the atacicept lupus nephritis clinical trial 
our clinical trial costs increased in as compared to  primarily reflecting the effort related to the rthrombin phase clinical trial costs 
contract manufacturing costs also increased in as compared to as we incurred significant costs related to the manufacture of rthrombin recothrom bulk drug and finished product inventory and clinical trial material for il and atacicept 
contract manufacturing costs increased in as a greater number of process validation and manufacturing campaigns for rthrombin were completed in to support the filing of a license application with the fda in late prior to fda approval on january   all manufacturing costs related to recothrom were expensed as research and development 
as of approval on january  we had expensed approximately million of recothrom inventory costs  million in finished vials and million in bulk drug  that would normally be recorded as inventory if they had been incurred subsequent to the fda approval of recothrom 
these previously expensed commercial product costs will result in reductions in cost of sales in and 
table of contents to date  our business needs have not required us to fully allocate all research and development costs among our various programs 
however  we track direct labor  contracted services and certain consumable costs by program  which we monitor to ensure appropriate utilization of company resources 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs 
these costs include indirect labor  certain consumable costs  facility costs  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  all of which benefit all of our research and development programs 
the following table presents our research and development costs allocated to clinical development  pre development and discovery research programs  together with the unallocated costs that benefit all programs 
the costs of clinical development programs are presented from the inception of clinical development activities for such programs to date 
due to the relatively short duration and lack of defined outcomes for pre development and discovery programs  costs from inception to date are not meaningful 
inception to date clinical development programs hemostasis autoimmunity and oncology antiviral pre development programs discovery research programs unallocated indirect costs total the following summarizes the reasons for fluctuations in research and development program costs for the three years presented in the table hemostasis clinical development program rthrombin and rfactor xiii costs increased in as compared to  partially due to the resumption of process validation and manufacturing campaigns for rthrombin to support the filing of a license application with the fda in late the costs include approximately million of manufacturing costs incurred for rthrombin commercial product prior to fda approval on january  without these program costs  the programs costs would have substantially declined  reflecting the lower level of development activities while awaiting fda approval 
autoimmunity and oncology clinical development program atacicept and il costs increased from to primarily due to an increase in our share of atacicept joint development costs paid to merck serono 
the slight decrease in costs from to was due to toxicology studies that were performed in for il that were not required in antiviral clinical development program costs in and as compared to reflect an increase in headcount related to activities associated with advancement of peg ifn l into clinical testing 
pre development program costs decreased in as compared to  partially reflecting the peg ifn l costs transitioning to the antiviral program in the increase in costs in  as compared to  partially reflects the impact of several projects transitioning from discovery into pre development 
discovery research program costs fluctuate from year to year reflecting the effort to work on new projects an increase in costs and the transitioning of successful projects to pre development a decrease in costs 
unallocated indirect costs increased in and as compared to primarily due to the impact of recording stock based compensation expense pursuant to sfas r 

table of contents the estimated times and costs to completion for the various stages of clinical development can vary significantly  depending on the nature of the product candidate  the disease indication in which it is being tested and many other factors 
general expectations for estimated times to completion of each stage of clinical testing are shown in the following table clinical phase estimated completion time phase years phase years phase years due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical testing and the clinical trials associated with biopharmaceutical research and development programs  the remaining time and cost to complete any such projects are difficult to estimate 
each succeeding phase is dependent on the outcome of the previous one  and the data obtained from these studies may be inadequate to support advancement to the next phase  requiring added time and effort 
many projects will not advance to the next phase  even though they appeared promising based on earlier data and test results 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense  which consists primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  professional fees and other corporate costs  increased in as compared to the increase was primarily related to increased marketing activities and the hiring of sales and marketing employees to support the planned launch of recothrom and increased legal costs 
in  general and administrative expense increased by as compared to  primarily due to the impact of recording stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
stock based compensation expense of million was recorded in as compared to  in higher personnel  patent and recruitment costs also contributed to the increase in we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative costs will increase in reflecting the full year of our sales force and increased recothrom marketing costs 
stock based compensation expense 
prior to  we elected to follow accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for employee stock option grants and apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas to account for our stock option plans 
under apb  compensation expense was based on the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we granted options with exercise prices that were lower than the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
using our best judgment to estimate the fair value of our stock as of the various grant dates  we recorded million of deferred compensation  which was fully amortized at december  effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminated the election to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we adopted the modified prospective transition method under sfas r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect stock based compensation 
we determine fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
the following amounts of stock based compensation expense were recorded for the two years reported in thousands research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense total 
table of contents other income expense investment income 
investment income is generated primarily from investment of our cash reserves in investment grade  fixed income securities 
there are three primary factors affecting the amount of investment income that we report the amount of cash reserves invested  the effective interest rate and the amount of realized gains or losses on investments held during the period 
the following table shows how each of these factors affected investment income for the three years reported in thousands weighted average amount of cash reserves effective interest rate investment income before gains and losses net gains losses on sales of investments investment income  as reported interest expense 
we have accounted for a sale leaseback transaction completed in october as a financing transaction 
under this method of accounting  an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale is considered a long term interest bearing liability 
rent payments under the leases are considered to be payments toward the liability and are allocated to principal and interest 
we recorded related interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which we intend to use to fund our operations and capital expenditures until we are able to generate positive cash flow 
these cash reserves are held in a variety of investment grade  fixed income securities  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
we believe that our existing cash resources and revenue generated from recothrom sales  together with anticipated proceeds from our collaborations  should provide sufficient funding through and into however  this is dependent on the level of success in marketing and selling recothrom 
we may complete additional collaborative development transactions  which would generate both revenues and cost reductions  or raise additional funds through an incremental financing which would help fund our company over a longer period of time 
cash flows from operating activities 
the amount of cash used to fund our operating activities generally tracks our net losses  with the following exceptions noncash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets  and noncash stock based compensation  which do not result in uses of cash  noncash milestone revenues  which were paid to the company in the form of equity securities  net realized gains and losses and amortization of premium on short term investments  which are reflected as sources of cash from investing activities upon maturity or sale of the respective investments  changes in receivables  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain revenues and the subsequent receipt of cash payments  changes in recothrom inventory subsequent to the january  approval date which reflect the use of cash but will not be expensed until the related product is sold  changes in deferred revenue  which reflect the difference in timing between the receipt of cash from option fees  license fees and other upfront payments and the subsequent recognition of these amounts as revenue over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations  and 
table of contents changes in other assets and liabilities  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses and their payment 
generally  with the exception of changes in deferred revenue  and inventory increases relating to recothrom  we do not expect these items to generate material year to year fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of net cash used in operating activities 
substantial license or upfront fees may be received upon the date we enter into new licensing or collaborative agreements and be recorded as deferred revenue 
for example  the million milestone payment from bayer has been recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue beginning in july through the first quarter of for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of previously deferred revenue 
the timing of additional deferred revenue transactions is expected to be irregular and  therefore  has the potential to create fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of cash used in operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
our most significant use of cash in investing activities is for capital expenditures 
we expend a certain amount each year to maintain the effectiveness of our business  eg  to adopt newly developed technologies  expand into new functional areas  adapt our facilities to changing needs and or replace obsolete assets 
in addition  we have used cash at various times to purchase land and expand our facilities 
we expect to spend approximately million in on routine capital equipment and facility projects 
cash flows from investing activities also reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and received from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be important to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows from financing activities 
net proceeds from common stock offerings have constituted by far the largest element of financing cash flows 
we received million in net proceeds from an underwritten follow on offering completed in august in addition  we periodically receive proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs as we continue to advance and expand our product development programs  as well as commercialize recothrom 
we expect these expenditures to increase over the next several years  particularly if the outcomes of clinical trials are successful and our product candidates continue to advance 
our plans include the internal development of selected product candidates and the co development of product candidates with collaborators where we would assume a percentage of the overall product development costs 
we also expect to incur substantial amounts during supporting the launch of recothrom 
although we are optimistic regarding its commercial prospects and the rate of market penetration  it might be quite some time  if ever  before our recothrom revenues exceed our expenses 
if at any time our prospects for financing these various initiatives decline  we may decide to look for ways to reduce our ongoing investment 
in such event  we might consider discontinuing our funding under existing co development arrangements  establishing new co development arrangements for other product candidates to provide additional funding sources or out licensing products  product candidates or certain rights related to products or product candidates that we might otherwise develop and commercialize internally 
additionally  we could consider delaying or discontinuing development of product candidates to reduce the level of our related expenditures 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on several factors  many of which may not be in our control  including success in marketing and selling recothrom  results of our research and development programs  
table of contents cash flows under existing and potential future arrangements with licensees  collaborators and other parties  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent and other claims  and costs associated with the expansion of our facilities 
over the next few years we expect to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including debt or equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing convertible debt  equity or equity based securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced  and these securities could have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or expansion plans  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market internally  with license terms that are not favorable to us 
contractual obligations at december  we were contractually obligated to make payments as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years building lease obligations operating leases development contracts recothrom manufacturing contracts total the building lease obligations resulted from our sale leaseback financing transaction and run until may operating leases generally relate to leased office space nearby our corporate headquarter buildings  and remaining terms range from one to four years 
we have certain renewal provisions at our option  which are not reflected in the above table  for the building leases and the operating leases 
recothrom manufacturing contracts include the manufacture of rthrombin bulk drug and recothrom finished product for commercial sale 
critical accounting estimates royalty revenue 
we earn royalties on several products marketed by other companies 
royalties on these products are received within to days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties 
to date  these adjustments have not been significant 
license fees  milestone payments and upfront fees 
we enter into various collaborative agreements that generate significant license  option or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
where we have no continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon receipt  as these payments represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
where we have continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized using one of two methods 
where we are able to estimate the total amount of 
table of contents services under the arrangement  revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model 
costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs are used to determine proportional performance  as this is considered to be representative of the delivery of outputs under the arrangement 
revenue recognized at any point in time  is limited to cash received and amounts contractually due 
changes in estimates of total expected performance are accounted prospectively as a change in estimate 
where we cannot estimate the total amount of service that is to be provided  a time based method is used to recognize revenue 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period  starting with the contract s commencement  but not before the removal of any contingencies for each milestone 
proportional performance is determined based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the completed portion of the non contingent payments received or due 
stock based compensation 
prior to  we elected to follow accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for employee stock option grants and apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas to account for our stock option plans 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminated the election to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and generally requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
we adopted the modified prospective transition method and determine fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes method involves making estimates of volatility  which we base on the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as the implied and historical volatility of other comparable companies 
additionally  our calculation of stock based compensation expense involves estimating future forfeitures of stock options based on our historical experience 
we have estimated the expected life of our stock options using the simplified method for determining the expected term as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulleting  share based payment 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we have no material foreign currency exposure  nor do we hold derivative financial instruments
