this discussion and analysis should be considered in light of such cautionary statement and the risk factors disclosed in item a of this report 
results of operations earnings per share increased substantially during to per share up on net income of  compared to per share on net income of  during the earnings increase included 
per share from a favorable decision in tax court regarding our ability to deduct interest expense allocated certain tax exempt investments 
the earnings increase was also driven by greater net interest margin  elimination of the interest rate swap expense seen during  and reduced salaries and employee benefits costs 
due to repurchase of psb stock  total average common shares outstanding declined during  which increased earnings per share from leverage of existing capital for accretion of income on a per share basis to current shareholders 
due to average asset growth of less than  volume growth was not a significant driver to increased profits in net income declined 
per share to during on net income of  compared to on net income of  in a decline in net interest margin without asset growth  higher provisions for estimated loan losses  and increased employee health insurance costs were the greatest factors behind lower net income  with these factors contributing 
of the decrease in earnings per share 
besides the factors behind the 
reduction in earnings per share  several special items were recognized in net income including a loss on sale of securities to restructure the balance sheet  gain on sale of vacant land formerly held for future branching  and an executive officer severance benefit 
the net impact of these special items was to decrease earnings per share by 
during the year 
lastly  during  psb determined an existing interest rate swap to convert a time deposit from fixed to floating rates did not q ualify for hedge accounting 
elimination of hedge accounting generated a non cash charge against net income of 
per share 
the swap was prepaid during item of this annual report on form k presents other various financial performance ratios and measures for the five years ending december  a number of separate factors impacted psb earnings during the past several years as outlined in the table below 
earnings have been volatile during the past five years 
since  earnings have declined as a result of a falling net interest rate margin through  reduced mortgage banking income  and increased wage  occupancy  technology and compliance expenses not offset by earning asset growth 
the following table presents psb s net income for the five years ending december   before tax adjusted special and nonrecurring income and expense items 
table summary operating income years ending december  net income before special items  net of tax executive officer severance benefit net gain loss on sale of securities gain on sale of vacant land held for branching reduction to tax expense from favorable tax court decision sale of pulse atm stock recovery write off of collection expenses loss on abandonment of home office branch closure charges wisconsin state income tax settlement gain on curtailment of post retirement benefit plan net income diluted earnings per share before special items diluted earnings per share as reported net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them 
interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to change in interest rates  contractual maturities  and repricing frequencies 
net interest income is the most significant item of psb revenue generated by operations 
psb incurs market risk primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
the measurement of the market risk associated with financial instruments such as loans and deposits is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that reflect changes in market prices and rates can be found in item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
psb s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while adjusting the asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
psb relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
in general  longer term earning assets are funded by shorter term funding sources allowing psb to earn net interest income on both the credit risk taken on assets and the yield curve of market interest rates 
however  a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
psb does not engage in trading activities to enhance earnings or for hedging purposes 
the following tables present average balance sheet data and related average interest rates on a tax equivalent basis and the impact of changes in the earnings assets base for the three years ending december  table average balances and interest rates average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate assets interest earning assets loans taxable securities tax exempt securities fhlb stock other total non interest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net cash surrender value life ins

the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of 
loan fees are included in total interest income as follows table interest income and expense volume and rate analysis compared to compared to increase decrease due to increase decrease due to volume rate net volume rate net interest earned on loans taxable securities tax exempt securities fhlb stock other interest income total interest paid on savings and demand deposits money market deposits time deposits fhlb borrowings other borrowings junior subordinated debentures total net interest earnings the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
the yield on tax exempt loans and investment securities has been adjusted to its fully taxable equivalent using a tax rate 
average earnings assets grew to  during compared to growth of to  during tax adjusted net interest income increased or in compared to a decline of or during during  approximately one third of the increase in net interest income was from greater earning asset growth volume and approximately two thirds of the increase was from an increase in the spread rate earned on average product balances 
during  the decline in net interest income from lower net margin on product spreads of as shown in table was not offset by additional net interest income of from the higher volume of earning assets during competition for both loans and deposits in psb s market area is strong with pricing pressure to hold down loan rates and to keep local deposit rates to levels near wholesale funding alternatives 
quarterly product spreads during were consistently greater than in during the first six months of  growth in asset yields from repricing loans and taxable securities outpaced increased funding costs  as quarterly asset yields increased 
while the quarterly cost of interest bearing liabilities funding costs increased 
during the last half of following the beginning of short term federal funds rate decreases by the federal reserve open markets committee  quarterly asset yields fell faster than quarterly funding costs  with funding costs down 
while asset yields declined 
during  net interest margin declined compared to  as interest bearing liabilities rates increased faster than asset yields throughout the year 
rising short term interest rates that began with federal reserve discount rate increases during june increased deposit costs faster than corresponding longer term interest rates 
static gap analysis projections showed earning assets to reprice with similar timing to interest bearing liabilities  but the extent of deposit repricing during was greater than loans as the market s interest yield curve was inverted for much of in  the federal home loan bank of chicago began to reduce the rate of quarterly dividends paid on their stock held by psb and other stockholders 
during  the fhlb ceased quarterly dividend payments and is not expected to pay a dividend during interest expense on other borrowings increased substantially during compared to prior years from an increase in wholesale repurchase agreement funding 
changes in national market rates made structured repurchase agreement funding substantially less than fhlb advances or brokered certificate of deposit funding 
during  psb originated new repurchase agreements to refinance maturing fhlb advances  and to enter into a leveraged security purchase  for increased net interest income 
due to limited investment securities available for pledging to repurchase agreements  and limitations on fhlb advance growth without purchase of additional capital stock  brokered certificates are the most likely source of wholesale funding during should local deposit growth lag asset growth 
currently  the relative cost of brokered certificates is significantly greater than equivalent term fhlb advances or repurchase agreements 
therefore  net interest income and net interest margin may be adversely impacted if asset growth cannot be funded from local deposit growth 
the following table outlines the change in yields during the three years ended december  table yield on earning assets year ended december  yield change yield change yield change yield on earning assets effective rate on all liabilities as a percent of earning assets net yield on earning assets provision for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed based upon credit quality  existing economic conditions  and loss exposure by loan category 
management determines the allowance for loan losses based on past loan experience  current economic conditions  composition of the loan portfolio  and the potential for future loss 
accordingly  the amount charged to expense is based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio 
it is psb s policy that when available information confirms that specific loans  or portions thereof  including impaired loans  are uncollectible  these amounts are promptly charged off against the allowance 
the provision for loan losses was in and in non performing loans relative to total loans and total assets declined slightly during after increasing in see additional discussion under this item in the section titled allowance for loan losses

growth in this deposit account category during led to the substantially increased debit card income 
however  results included several special items impacting non interest income as outlined in the following paragraphs 
during  psb entered into a million interest rate swap receive fixed  pay variable payments to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in a fixed rate certificate of deposit that was later determined to not qualify for hedge accounting 
eliminating the application of fair value hedge accounting in march caused psb to mark the swap liability to fair value and generated a charge against noninterest income 
following a decline in interest rates which lowered the swap liability  this swap was prepaid in the march quarter with a final payment of swap final maturity was in october 
changes in the fair value of the swap liability and the monthly settlement payments were recorded as reductions to noninterest income 
disclosures about the impact of the interest rate swap can be found in item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  psb purchased vacant land in the portage county  wisconsin business park for a possible de novo branch location 
during  psb decided to forego entering the market as a de novo branch and sold the land to an unrelated party for a gain on sale of  which is included in the gain on sale of premises and equipment 
in response to falling long term market rates in september and the ability to offset a securities loss against the one time gain on sale of land held for branching  psb restructured its balance sheet by selling low yielding securities for a loss and reinvesting in longer term higher yielding securities 
during the september quarter  psb sold million of securities which generated a loss of if the impact to noninterest income from the three special items were excluded  noninterest income would have been  in and  in  an increase of or 
special noninterest income items in included a gain on sale of securities  of swap settlement income  and gain on sale of pulse stock
