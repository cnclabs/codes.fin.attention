you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption item a 
risk factors 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical need with a specific focus on the us market 
through strategic alliances primarily with japanese pharmaceutical companies  we are developing a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates  each of which we believe has a well characterized and differentiated therapeutic profile  attractive commercial potential and patent assets having claims of commercially adequate scope 
we are a development stage company 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
at december   from inception  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  including million of non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee stock based compensation and founders warrants 
we expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our existing product candidates and over the long term as we expand our research and development programs and acquire or in license products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
revenues and cost of revenues we have not generated any revenues from licensing  milestones or product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates within the next several years  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated from providing development management services under master service agreements with asahi kasei pharma corporation and argenes  inc  pursuant to which we billed consulting fees and our pass through clinical contract costs 
the primary cost associated with our revenue was the clinical contract costs we incurred and passed through to our customer 
our agreement with asahi kasei pharma corporation has been completed  and we terminated our agreement with argenes  inc therefore  we will not generate any further revenue from these agreements 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with feasibility studies  licensing and preclinical and clinical development and manufacture of our product candidates 
we use external 
table of contents service providers to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  therefore  these research and development expenses consist substantially of external costs  such as fees paid to consultants  contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and other external service providers  including professional fees and costs associated with legal services  patents and patent applications for our intellectual property 
internal research and development expenses consist of costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies  materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
to the extent that costs  including personnel costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program  such costs are included in the unallocated category in the table below 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated in thousands product candidate disease indication years ended december  mn status asthmaticus mn multiple sclerosis mn bronchial asthma mn interstitial cystitis mn solid tumors mn generalized anxiety disorder insomnia mn preterm labor mn urinary incontinence mn thrombotic disorders mn thrombotic disorders socc cancer  inflammatory diseases unallocated total research and development because such expenditures were committed prior to the strategic shift we implemented in june to focus resources on our two prioritized product candidates  mn for the treatment of status asthmaticus  or acute exacerbations of asthma  and mn for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  or ms  we made substantial research and development expenditures in certain of our other product development programs following such strategic shift 
however  as part of our strategic shift  we have been and will continue to limit our expenditures on our other product development programs to only those activities necessary to maximize the value of such product candidates  while aggressively pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such product candidates on appropriate terms 
in addition  as of the end of fiscal year  we are not planning to pursue any further clinical development of mn for the treatment of ms beyond the ongoing phase ii clinical trial until such time that we are able to secure a strategic collaboration to further development of mn we expect our research and development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the development of selected product development programs  primarily related to mn for the treatment of status asthmaticus 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product 
table of contents candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  for a product candidate could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  business development  legal and information systems support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include facilities and insurance costs 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on monitoring the status of the specified project  contractual factors such as milestones or retainer fees  services provided and invoices received 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  general and administrative accruals have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to our significant accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to further our research and development activities and include salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials  costs associated with non clinical activities such as toxicology testing  regulatory activities  research related overhead expenses and fees paid to external service providers who conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf 
we use external service providers and vendors to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other products and services related to our product development programs 
research and development expenses also include fees for licensed technology for which technological feasibility has not been established and there are no alternative uses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
share based payments we grant stock options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
additionally  we have outstanding stock options that were granted under our general stock incentive plan from which we no longer make grants 
the benefits provided under both of these plans are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  
table of contents share based payment  which requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of these awards is measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock award and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock award  the grant date fair value of the award would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
on january   we elected to use the modified prospective application in adopting sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards  unvested awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and any awards that are subsequently modified or cancelled 
our results of operations for the years ended december  and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r require us to estimate certain variables  such as estimated volatility and expected life 
if any of our estimations change  such changes could have a significant impact on the stock based compensation amount we recognize 
prior to  we accounted for employee stock options and warrants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option and warrant issuances at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock 
with respect to stock options  we recognize this compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues for the year ended december   a decrease of million when compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was due to a lack of activity under our master services agreement with argenes  inc  which was terminated in june we will not generate any further revenues from this agreement 
research and development research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of million related to the advancement and subsequent termination of a phase iii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  an increase of million related to the completion of a phase iia clinical trial for mn for the treatment of insomnia  an increase of million in our prioritized drug development program for mn for the treatment of status asthmaticus primarily related to the advancement of a phase ii clinical trial and market research  an increase of million in our prioritized drug development program for mn for the treatment of ms primarily related to preclinical studies  manufacturing of drug  market research and consulting services  an increase of in our other drug development programs and unallocated research and development expenditures  an increase of million in stock based compensation  and an offset of million related to the completion of clinical trials related to the product development programs for mn for the treatment of solid tumors  mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder  mn for the treatment of interstitial cystitis  or ic  and mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence 
since we have determined to focus our resources on our two prioritized product candidates  mn for the treatment of status asthmaticus and mn for the treatment of ms  we expect that our research and development expenses will increase with respect to these two prioritized product candidates in future periods as we continue clinical development of these product candidates  primarily related to fees paid to external service 
table of contents providers for the management and conduct of clinical trials and the performance of data collection and analysis 
in contrast  we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease with respect to the remainder of our existing product candidates in future periods  as we will limit expenditures on these product candidates to those development activities necessary to maximize their value for purposes of monetizing such product candidates 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million of stock based compensation expense  an increase of million in compensation related expenses due to salaries and severance payments  and offset by a decrease of million in legal fees and a decrease of million in financial advisor and other fees 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we expand our infrastructure and incur additional costs for insurance and professional and consulting fees associated with operating as a dual listed public company and supporting our product development programs and business development activities 
interest income interest income primarily consisted of income earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to decreased investment balances and lower rates of return on our investments 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was due to the completion of our contract with asahi kasei pharma corporation in fiscal year and reduced activity under our master service agreement with argenes  inc research and development research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of million related to the advancement of the phase ii clinical trial and milestone payment for mn for the treatment of ms  an increase of million in product licensing costs related to our thrombosis product candidates  mn and mn  which were in licensed in october  
table of contents an increase of million in stock based compensation expense  and an increase of million in other costs  primarily consulting services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million of stock based compensation expense  an increase of million of legal  accounting and financial advisor fees primarily due to costs associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts and operations as a dual listed public company  and an increase of related to accrued bonuses 
interest income interest income primarily consisted of income earned on our cash and investment balances 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher yields on our average cash and investment balances 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our operations have been financed through the private placement of our equity securities and through the public sale of our common stock  net of treasury stock repurchases 
through december   we received estimated net proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities as follows in september  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to founders for aggregate proceeds of million  in october and august  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series a preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  from march through may  we issued and sold  shares of series b preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  on september   we issued and sold  shares of series c preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  on february   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses including issuance costs for registration statements filed on behalf of restricted shareholders through december  on march   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions the sale of these shares was the result of the underwriters partial exercise of the over allotment option we granted to them in connection with our ipo  on march   we issued and sold  shares of common stock to a founder in exercise of warrants for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  
table of contents in august  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to a founder in exercise of warrants and we issued  shares to a former employee in exercise of stock options for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  and on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and certain other costs associated with the offering 
in february  april and august  a founder exercised warrants to purchase   and  shares of our common stock  respectively  at per share in cashless exercises that resulted in the issuance of   and  shares of common stock  respectively 
in january  a founder exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in a cashless exercise that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in september  a founder exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in a cashless exercise that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
at december   no underlying shares of common stock remained subject to purchase under the terms of the founders warrants 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
at december   we had million in marketable securities available for sale as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
at december   our marketable securities included million of auction rate securities  or ars  issued primarily by municipalities and universities that were issued through syndicated offerings and million of ars issued through private placements 
the recent negative conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors  including ourselves  from liquidating certain holdings of ars 
at december   million of private placement ars experienced failed auctions since august  and these failed auctions have continued into subsequent to december   we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for million of our ars 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid  and we could be required to hold them for an undetermined period of time 
however  through february   million of our total ars portfolio were successfully auctioned and sold at par  which was equivalent to their carrying value 
as a consequence  our exposure to ars was reduced by million and the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in cash equivalents 
as such  we have sufficient capital to fund our operations through net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net loss incurred during the year ended december  of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million related to the net maturity of investments  offset by million of capital equipment purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the year ended december   primarily due to the net proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock which closed on february  we have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating requirements through at least december  although we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements through at least december   including all of our planned research and development activities  we anticipate that we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of  many factors  including progress in  and the costs of  our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of our product development programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
table of contents the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates  the costs of establishing  or contracting for  sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization activities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our product candidates  and the costs associated with any litigation 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through strategic collaborations  private or public sales of our securities  debt financings or licensing transactions  involving all or a portion of our product candidates  to the extent we are able to do so 
we cannot be certain that additional sources of capital will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if sources of capital are not available  we may not be in a position to pursue present or future business opportunities that require financial commitments  and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our product development programs or our commercialization efforts  curtail our efforts to acquire new product candidates or relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations related to facility leases and office equipment leases as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total current years thereafter operating leases we also enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis and other services in connection with our product development programs 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our product development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
we have also entered into license agreements for our product candidates that may require us to make payments in the future based upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to clinical development  regulatory or commercial events 
we will also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products  if any are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for commercial sale 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur at present 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income 

table of contents all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
our marketable securities consist of auction rate securities  corporate debt and government sponsored securities with aaa ratings at the time of purchase 
as of december   our short term investments included million of ars issued primarily by municipalities and universities that were issued through syndicated offerings and million of ars issued through private placements 
our ars are debt instruments with long term maturities in which the interest rates are reset in short intervals through dutch auctions by matching buyers and sellers 
the recent conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors  including ourselves  from liquidating certain holdings of ars because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for the securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of the dutch auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to the maximum interest rate applicable to the specific securities being auctioned as per the official statement issued at the initial bond sale 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
subsequent to december   we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auction for million of our ars 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid  and we could be required to hold them for an undetermined period of time 
however  through february   million of our total ars portfolio were successfully auctioned and sold at par  which was equivalent to their carrying value 
with the sale of these securities  we reduced our overall ars exposure by million  as the proceeds were reinvested in cash equivalents 
as such  we have sufficient capital to fund operations through fiscal year at february   due to continued auction failures of our private placement ars in and the downgrading of the companies that insure certain of our ars  the quality rating of million of municipal ars went from aaa to a and the quality rating of million of private placement ars went from aaa to a  we experienced an additional million decline in the carrying value of our ars as their estimated market value had decreased 
with the uncertainty that exists in the global credit market today  we will continue to closely monitor the market and evaluate our ars portfolio on an ongoing basis  and we will adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge that would be recorded as realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations should any decline in market value be considered other than temporary 
in addition  any liquidity issues which extend into or beyond could adversely affect our business
