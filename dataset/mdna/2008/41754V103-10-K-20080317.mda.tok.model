item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business executive summary harvest natural resources  inc is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  production and disposition of oil and natural gas properties since  when it was incorporated under delaware law 
we have acquired and developed significant interests in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela through our subsidiary harvest vinccler  sca harvest vinccler and our equity affiliate  petrodelta sa petrodelta and have undeveloped acreage offshore of the people s republic of china china 
in  we executed a sale and purchase agreement for a partial interest in the production sharing contract related to the dussafu marin field offshore gabon in west africa dussafu psc  and a farm in agreement for a partial interest in the production sharing contract related to the budong budong field onshore indonesia budong psc 
all conditions precedent in the agreements are complete except for governmental approvals 
currently  our only producing asset is in venezuela 
since  our subsidiary  harvest vinccler  has been providing operating services to petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa for the south monagas unit under an operating service agreement osa 
on march   harvest vinccler signed a memorandum of understanding the mou with two affiliates of pdvsa  corporaci n venezolana del petroleo sa cvp and pdvsa petroleo sa ppsa  to convert the osa into a minority interest in petrodelta 
on august   the mou was amended to provide for the addition of the isle o  el salto and temblador fields new fields to petrodelta as additional consideration for the conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
on december   at our special meeting of the stockholders  the transactions contemplated by the mou were approved 
on september   we signed the contract of conversion conversion contract  and on october   together with cvp  we formed and funded petrodelta 
on october   the venezuelan presidential decree which formally transferred to petrodelta the rights to the uracoa  tucupita and bombal fields smu fields and the new fields  subject to the conditions of the conversion contract  was published in the official gazette 
harvest vinccler has transferred all of its tangible assets and contracts  permits and rights related to the smu fields in venezuela to petrodelta 
in january  a majority of harvest vinccler s employees accepted positions with petrodelta 
petrodelta will engage in the exploration  production  gathering  transportation and storage of hydrocarbons from the smu fields and new fields collectively petrodelta fields 
hnr finance bv hnr finance has a percent ownership interest in petrodelta 
as we indirectly own percent of hnr finance  we indirectly own a net percent interest in petrodelta  and our partner  oil gas technology consultants 
table of contents netherlands co peratie ua ogtc  a controlled affiliate of venezolana de inversiones y construcciones clerico  ca vinccler  indirectly owns the remaining eight percent interest 
cvp owns the remaining percent 
at our request  cvp has added hnr finance as a party to the conversion contract 
petrodelta is governed by its own board of directors  charter and bylaws 
in april  the venezuelan national assembly passed legislation terminating all operating service agreements and directed the government to take over the operations carried out by the private companies without prejudice to the incorporation of mixed companies for that purpose 
this action  coupled with the unfinished conversion to petrodelta  left harvest vinccler without a contractual means recognized by the government of venezuela to address revenues or costs and expenses from april  until october  as a result of this situation  our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap from april  until september   did not reflect the net results of our producing operations in venezuela 
since the conversion contract terms have been fulfilled  we have recorded the results of operations and economic benefits of our ownership in petrodelta from april  through december  in the fourth quarter of as net income from unconsolidated equity affiliates 
since signing the mou in march  cvp has designated its board members and a general manager and president for petrodelta 
while petrodelta has been formed  funded and is the legal owner of the petrodelta fields  harvest vinccler continued in the day to day operations of the petrodelta fields until the end of january during  harvest vinccler advanced cash to petrodelta of million to fund its operations of which million remains to be repaid as of february  at december   harvest vinccler had one loan outstanding with a venezuelan bank for a total of billion venezuela bolivars bolivars approximately million 
this loan is cash collateralized by million deposited in a u 
s 
bank 
the loan represents the remaining balance originally borrowed in to pay income tax assessments and related interest to the seniat  the venezuelan income tax authority 
in december  we changed our accounting method for oil and gas exploration and development activities to the successful efforts method from the full cost method 
although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development continues to be an accepted method of accounting for oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting as prescribed by sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies is the preferred method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  financial information for prior periods has been restated to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method 
we believe the successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of our results of operations and the ability to assess our future investments in oil and gas properties for impairment based on their estimated fair values rather than being required to base valuation on prices and costs as of the balance sheet date 
the significant differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting for oil and gas properties relate to the expensing of exploration activities and related unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities 
the expensing of these costs can create volatility in the statement of operations 
the change in accounting principle resulted in a cumulative  non cash increase to retained earnings of million  net of income tax  as of december  retained earnings increased due to the reversal of ceiling test write downs in prior years required under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission sec 
there were no such impairments under the successful efforts accounting rules 
the effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and was a decrease of million and million  net of income tax  or and per diluted share  respectively 
the decrease in income from continuing operations was due to an increase in depletion expense 
there was no effect on cash and cash equivalents 
for additional information on the impact of the change to the successful efforts method of accounting see part iv  item  notes to the consolidated financial statements  note organization and summary of significant accounting policies property and equipment and change in accounting principle 
see item business  operations  item a risk factors  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed description of these and other events during as of december   we had total assets of million  unrestricted cash in the amount of million and no long term debt

our strategy has broadened from our primary focus on venezuela to identify  access and integrate hydrocarbon assets to include organic growth through exploration in basins globally with proven hydrocarbon systems 
we seek to leverage our venezuelan experience as well as our recently expanded business development and technical platform to create a diversified resource base 
with the addition of technical resources  opening of our london office  the planned opening of a singapore office  the redeployment of resources from our moscow office  as well as our earlier purchase of a percent equity interest in fusion geophysical  llc fusion  we have made significant investments to provide the necessary foundation and global reach required for an organic growth focus 
while exploration will become a larger part of our overall portfolio  we will generally restrict ourselves to basins with known hydrocarbon systems and favorable risk reward profiles 
our goal  with the conversion process in venezuela completed  is to influence the management and operations of petrodelta while developing and producing the petrodelta fields in the most efficient manner 
we expect that amounts available for dividends will be distributed to us on a regular basis after a catch up dividend for the period of april  to december  then petrodelta is expected to reinvest a substantial portion of its earnings in its development and producing activities and  accordingly  we expect subsequent dividends to be minimal in the near term 
we intend to use our available cash to pursue additional growth opportunities in gabon  indonesia  china and other countries that meet our strategy 
however  the execution of this strategy may be limited by factors including access to additional capital and the receipt of a dividend from petrodelta as well as the need to preserve adequate development capital in the interim 
the ability to successfully execute our strategy is subject to significant risks including  among other things  payment of petrodelta dividends  exploration  operating  political  legal and financial risks

an unofficial english translation of the conversion contract is attached to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  filed with the sec on november  location and geology south monagas unit fields smu fields uracoa field there are currently oil and natural gas producing wells and five water injection wells in the field 
the current production facility has capacity to handle thousand barrels mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day  and storage of up to mbbls of crude oil 
all natural gas presently being delivered by petrodelta is produced from the uracoa field 
tucupita field there are currently oil producing wells and five water injection wells in the field 
the tucupita production facility has capacity to process mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day and storage for up to mbbls of crude oil 
the oil is transported through a mile  mbbls of oil per day pipeline from the tucupita field to the uracoa plant facilities 
bombal field the east bombal field was drilled in  and currently has two producing wells 
there are currently two oil producing wells in the west bombal field 
the fluid produced from west bombal field flows through a six mile pipeline and is tied into the mile tucupita oil pipeline to the uracoa plant facilities 
development of the east bombal field has been incorporated into petrodelta s long term development plan 
infrastructure and facilities petrodelta has a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility  the custody transfer point 
the marketing contract specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than one 
table of contents percent base sediment and one percent water 
quality measurements are conducted both at petrodelta s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
petrodelta has a mile pipeline with a normal capacity of million cubic feet mmcf of natural gas per day and a design capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day 
petrodelta has assumed from harvest vinccler as part of the conversion the long term power purchase agreements for the electrical needs  the long term agreements for the leasing of compression and the operation and maintenance of the gas treatment and compression facilities at the uracoa and tucupita fields through isle o  temblador and el salto fields new fields the new fields transferred to petrodelta after conversion are located in the same geographic area and have the same geology and productive formations as the smu fields 
as with the smu fields before harvest vinccler s entry in  there has been minimal development activity in the three fields during the last years 
isle o field the isle o field was discovered in d seismic data is available over a portion of the field 
seven oil appraisal wells have been drilled in isle o which have confirmed the presence of commercial oil deposits 
the field is located near existing infrastructure in the smu fields 
petrodelta s business plan projects full development of the isle o field over the next three years 
temblador field the temblador field was discovered in and developed in the s and s 
temblador has produced approximately million barrels of oil and billion cubic feet of natural gas from wells since d seismic is available over the entire temblador field 
el salto field the el salto field was discovered in a total of appraisal wells have been drilled identifying nine productive structures and six productive formations 
the field has produced less than million boe and is currently dormant 
d seismic data is available over one third of the field 
we believe the el salto field has substantial exploration upside from several fault blocks  which have been identified using d seismic data but have not yet been confirmed through drilling 
business plan of petrodelta petrodelta s business plan was approved as part of the conversion process 
petrodelta s immediate focus will be the resumption of drilling in the uracoa field which is expected to result in a rapid increase in production 
concurrently  petrodelta will acquire and process or reprocess existing d seismic over the new fields 
isle o field production can be integrated into the existing uracoa field infrastructure providing for early production from the field 
temblador field production would be processed at existing field facilities 
the el salto field is believed to contain substantial undeveloped reserves 
accordingly  we expect to acquire additional d seismic and undergo significant appraisal and development in a timely manner to provide for larger scale development implementation 
overall  production is expected to peak four to six years from commencement of drilling by petrodelta

these risks and other risk factors are discussed in item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
wab  south china sea general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a border dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with another company 
the border dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the wab area due to the dispute 
location and geology the wab contract area is located in the west wan an basin nam con son on the south china sea 
its western edge lies approximately miles to the east of significant natural gas fields at lan tay and lan do  which are reported to contain two trillion cubic feet of natural gas and commenced production in november wab is also adjacent to the thien ung discovery which tested oil and natural gas and lies east of the dua and chim sao formerly blackbird discoveries which successfully tested oil and gas in the wab 
table of contents contract area covers several similar structural trends and geological formations  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones similar to the known fields and discoveries 
drilling and development activity due to the border dispute between china and vietnam  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained license extensions  with the current extension in effect until may  while no assurance can be given  we believe we will continue to receive contract extensions so long as the border disputes persist 
undeveloped acreage acreage the following table summarizes the undeveloped acreage that we hold under concession as of december  undeveloped gross net china title to undeveloped acreage the wab petroleum contract lies within an area which is the subject of a border dispute between china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with a third party 
the border dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the wab area due to the dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution 
dussafu marin  offshore gabon general in november  we executed a sale and purchase agreement for the purchase of a percent interest in the dussafu psc 
all conditions precedent to the sale and purchase agreement are complete except for final government and partner approvals 
we anticipate receiving final approvals during the first half of on receipt of final partner approval  we will become the operator of the dussafu psc 
the purchase will be recorded in the quarter in which approvals are received 
location and geology the dussafu psc contract area is located offshore gabon  adjacent to the border with the republic of congo 
it contains  acres with water depths to  feet 
the dussafu psc has two small oil discoveries in the gamba and dentale reservoirs and a small natural gas discovery 
production and infrastructure exists in the blocks contiguous to the dussafu psc 
drilling and development activity the dussafu psc partners and the republic of gabon  represented by the ministry of mines  energy  petroleum and hydraulic resources republic of gabon  recently agreed to enter into the second exploration phase of the dussafu psc with an effective date of may  the second exploration phase is a three year work commitment which includes the acquisition and processing of kilometers of d seismic  geology and geophysical interpretation  engineering studies and the drilling of a conditional well 
leads in the underexplored syn rift potential in the m baya and lucina reservoirs that are commercial in immediately adjacent fields have been identified and are expected to be the focus of the work program  which includes the acquisition and processing of kilometers of d seismic data 
the dussafu psc partners anticipate prospects can be generated to test these play concepts in 
table of contents budong budong  onshore indonesia general in february  indonesia s oil and gas regulatory authority  bp migas  approved the assignment to us of a percent interest in the budong psc located onshore west sulawesi  indonesia 
final government approval from migas is pending 
the budong psc includes a ten year exploration period and a year development phase 
in the initial three year exploration phase  which began january  we expect to acquire  process and interpret approximately kilometers of d seismic and drill two exploration wells 
our partner  tately budong budong nv tately  will be the operator through the exploration phase as required by the terms of the budong psc 
we will have control of major decisions and financing for the project with an option to operate in the development and production phase if approved by bp migas 
location and geology the budong psc covers million acres and includes the lariang and karama sub basins which are the eastern onshore extension of the west sulawesi foldbelt wsfb 
exploration to date in the basin is immature due to previously difficult jungle terrain  which is now accessible with the development of palm oil plantations and their related infrastructure 
field work performed over the last years  as outcrops have been more accessible  has given a new understanding to the presence of eocene source and reservoir potential that had not previously been recognized 
recent seismic surveys have greatly improved the understanding of the geology and enhanced the prospectivity of the offshore wsfb and  by analogy  the sparsely explored onshore area 
to date  a total of eight leads have been recognized 
it will be necessary to acquire a grid of seismic data to confirm the structures and give an indication of eocene target s within the section and to mature these leads into drillable prospects 
the two identified sub basins lariang and karama provide an opportunity to test prospects in two sub basins 
farm in agreement terms we acquired the percent interest in the budong psc by committing to fund the first phase of the exploration program including the acquisition of d seismic and drilling of the first two exploration wells 
this commitment is capped at million 
prior to drilling the first exploration well  subject to the estimated cost of that well  tately will have a one time option to increase the level of the carried interest to million  and as compensation for the increase  we will increase our participation to a maximum of percent 
this equates to a total carried cost for the farm in of million 
regulation general our operations and our ability to finance and fund our growth strategy are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by change in governments  civil unrest  price and currency controls  limitations on oil and natural gas production  tax  environmental  safety and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in laws relating to the petroleum industry  changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations  and changes in contract interpretation and policies of contract adherence 

table of contents in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed  sometimes retroactively  for a variety of political  economic  environmental and other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and our potential for economic loss 
competition we encounter substantial competition from major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies in acquiring properties and leases for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and natural gas properties include staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such properties  the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such properties  and access to local partners and governmental entities 
many of our competitors have influence  financial resources  staffs  data resources and facilities substantially greater than ours 
environmental regulation various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment may affect our operations and costs 
we are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 
however  regulatory requirements may  and often do  change and become more stringent  and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
employees at december   our houston office had full time employees 
our caracas  moscow and london offices had  and employees  respectively 
we augment our employees from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
on february   we reduced the staff of our moscow office to three employees and will be redeploying two of these employees to london 
mr 
robert speirs will relocate and head our new singapore office which is planned to open in the singapore office will coordinate our eastern operations and business development 
item a 
risk factors in addition to other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating us 
we may not be able to meet the requirements of the global expansion of our business strategy 
we have added a global exploration component to diversify our overall portfolio 
in many locations  we may be required to post performance bonds in support of a work program 
we also intend to acquire underdeveloped  undeveloped and exploration properties from time to time for which the primary risks may be technical  operational or both 
our strategy to identify  access and integrate hydrocarbon assets in known hydrocarbon basins globally carries greater deal execution  operating  financial  legal and political risks 
the environments in which we operate are often difficult and the ability to operate successfully will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to control the pace of development  our ability to apply best practices in drilling and development  and the fostering of productive and transparent relationships with local partners  the local community and governmental authorities 
financial risks include our ability to control costs and attract financing for our projects 
in addition  often the legal systems of these countries are not mature and their reliability is uncertain 
this may affect our ability to enforce contracts and achieve certainty in our rights to develop and operate oil and natural gas projects  as well as our ability to obtain adequate compensation for any resulting losses 
our strategy depends on our ability to have significant influence over operations and financial control 

table of contents operations in areas outside the united states are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
our operations are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection  civil unrest  strikes and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  being subject to foreign laws  legal systems and the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or tribunals  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies  including taxes  governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign policy  foreign trade  taxation and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this annual report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves based on our equity investment in petrodelta 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used  and these variances may be material 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to in part iv  item  notes to the consolidated financial statements  table v standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and additional supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities unaudited for venezuelan equity affiliate as of december  and  table v standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in demand  changes in our ability to produce or changes in governmental regulations  policies or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
our future operations and our investments in equity affiliates are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas exploration and development drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in experienced labor  delays in receiving necessary governmental permits  shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  
table of contents delays in receipt of permits or access to lands  and government actions or changes in regulations 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and availability for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and natural gas production 
in order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
our cash position and limited ability to access additional capital may limit our growth opportunities 
at december   we had million of available cash and  until petrodelta pays a dividend  there will be no additional cash available from operations 
having a petrodelta dividend as our sole source of cash flow limits our access to additional capital and our concentration of political risk in venezuela may limit our ability to leverage our assets 
in addition  our future cash position depends upon the payment of dividends by petrodelta  in particular for the period from april  through december  while we believe such dividends  if available  will be paid  there is no assurance this will be the case 
these factors may limit our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional oil and gas properties and projects 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and natural gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our strategy 
we are a small organization and depend on the skills and experience of a few individuals in key management and operating positions to execute our business strategy 
loss of one or more key individuals in the organization could hamper or delay achieving our strategy 
we may not receive the required government approvals for the dussafu psc and or the budong psc 
although all conditions precedent to the dussafu psc sale and purchase agreement and the budong psc farm in agreement have been met  there is no certainty that the republic of gabon or indonesia s migas will approve the respective agreements 
without the governmental approvals  we will not have an interest in either asset 
we no longer directly manage operations of petrodelta 
pdvsa  through cvp  exercises substantial control over operations  making petrodelta subject to some internal policies and procedures of pdvsa as well as being subject to constraints in skilled personnel available to petrodelta 
these issues may have an adverse effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of petrodelta operations 
now that the conversion to petrodelta is completed  we are a minority interest owner in petrodelta 
even though we have substantial negative control provisions as a minority owner in petrodelta  our control of petrodelta is limited to our rights under the conversion contract and its annexes and the charter and bylaws 
as a result  our ability to implement or influence petrodelta s business plan  assure quality control  and set the timing and pace of development may be adversely affected 

table of contents now that the conversion to petrodelta is completed  petrodelta has a new sales contract with ppsa  and we have no experience with ppsa as to the timeliness of their payment of invoices 
under the osa between harvest vinccler and pdvsa  pdvsa had a history of making timely payment of invoices for oil and natural gas deliveries 
even though there is no reason not to believe that ppsa won t make timely payment of invoices for oil and natural gas deliveries  there is no guarantee that this will be the case 
petrodelta s business plan will be sensitive to market prices for oil 
petrodelta will be operating under a business plan  the success of which will rely heavily on the market price of oil 
to the extent that market values of oil decline  the business plan of petrodelta may be adversely affected 
a decline in the market price of crude oil could uniquely affect the financial condition of petrodelta 
under the terms of the conversion contract and other governmental documents  petrodelta is subject to a special advantage tax ventajas especiales which requires that if in any year the aggregate amount of royalties  taxes and certain other contributions is less than percent of the value of the hydrocarbons produced  petrodelta must pay the government the difference 
in the event of a significant decline in crude prices  the ventajas especiales could force petrodelta to operate at a loss 
moreover  our ability to control those losses by modifying the business plan or restricting the budget is limited under the conversion contract 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect petrodelta s future  our dividends and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and dividends from petrodelta 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically and lower oil production could affect the amount of natural gas we can produce 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause fluctuations in oil prices include relatively minor changes in the global supply and demand for oil  export quotas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and policies  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing and oil consuming countries  and overall economic conditions 
petrodelta may not be able to pay dividends on its operations 
while we continue to maintain cash reserves  our investment in petrodelta currently represents all of our near term cash generating capability  and the funds available to pursue our growth strategy may be adversely affected by petrodelta s inability to pay a dividend 
the total capital required for development of the new fields in venezuela may exceed the ability of petrodelta to finance 
petrodelta s ability to fully develop the fields in venezuela will require a significant investment 
petrodelta s future capital requirements for the development of the new fields may exceed the cash available from existing cash flow 
petrodelta s ability to secure financing is currently limited and uncertain  and has been  and may be  affected by numerous factors beyond its control  including the risks associated with operating in venezuela 
because of this financial risk  petrodelta may not be able to secure either the equity or debt financing necessary to meet its future cash needs for investment  which may limit its ability to fully develop the properties  cause delays with their development or require early divestment of all or a portion of those projects 
this could negatively impact our investment 
if we are called upon to fund petrodelta s operations  our failure to do so could be considered a default under the conversion contract and cause the forfeiture of some or all our shares in petrodelta 
in addition  cvp may be unable or unwilling to fund its share of capital requirements and our ability to require them to do so is limited 
we may not be able to replace production from petrodelta with new reserves 
in general  production rates and remaining reserves from oil and natural gas properties decline as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or 
table of contents expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
the legal or fiscal regime for petrodelta may change and the venezuelan government may not honor its commitments 
while we believe that the conversion contract and petrodelta provide a basis for a more durable arrangement in venezuela  the value of the investment necessarily depends upon venezuela s maintenance of legal  tax  royalty and contractual stability 
our recent experiences in venezuela demonstrate that such stability cannot be assured 
while we have and will continue to take measures to mitigate our risks  no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in doing so or that events beyond our control will not adversely affect the value of our investment in venezuela 
tax claims by municipalities in venezuela may adversely affect harvest vinccler s financial condition 
the municipalities of uracoa and libertador have asserted numerous tax claims against harvest vinccler which we believe are without merit 
however  the reliability of venezuela s judicial system is a source of concern and it can be subject to local and political influences

the situation in venezuela has also restricted our available cash and had a significant adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing to acquire and develop growth opportunities elsewhere 
until there is clarity and certainty over receipt of payment for prior crude oil and natural gas deliveries and the payment of dividends by petrodelta  uncertainty over the future of our investment in venezuela will continue to affect our performance and limit our growth opportunities 
we will use our available cash and future access to capital markets to expand our diversified strategy in a number of countries that fit our strategic investment criteria 
in executing our business strategy  we will strive to maintain financial prudence and rigorous investment criteria  access capital markets  create a diversified portfolio of assets  preserve our financial flexibility  use our experience and skills to acquire new projects  and keep our organizational capabilities in line with our rate of growth 

table of contents to accomplish our strategy  we intend to diversify our political risk acquire oil and natural gas fields in a number of countries to diversify and reduce the overall political risk of our investment portfolio 
seek operational and financial control we desire control of major decisions for development  production  staffing and financing for each project for a period of time sufficient for us to ensure maximum returns on investments 
establish a presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a presence in the countries and areas we operate through joint venture partners to facilitate stronger governmental and business relationships 
in addition  we use local personnel to help us take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we are willing to agree to minimum capital expenditures or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments to fulfill them over time under a prudent plan of development  allowing near term operating cash flow to help fund further investment  thereby limiting our maximum cash exposure 
we also seek to maximize available local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
provide technical expertise we believe there is an advantage in being able to provide geological  geophysical and engineering expertise beyond what many companies or countries possess internally 
in addition to our in house technical capabilities  in january we acquired a minority interest in fusion  a technical firm with significant experience in providing leading edge geophysical  geosciences and reservoir engineering services in many places in the world 
through this acquisition we have strategic access to these services 
maintain a prudent financing plan we intend to maintain our financial flexibility by closely monitoring spending  holding sufficient cash reserves  minimizing the use of restricted cash  actively seeking opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of capital and increase our access to debt and equity markets 
manage exploration risks 
we seek to manage the higher risk of exploration by diversifying our prospect portfolio  applying state of the art technology for analyzing targets and focusing on opportunities in proven active hydrocarbon systems with infrastructure 
establish various sources of production 
we seek to establish new production from our exploration and development efforts in a number of diverse markets and expect to monetize production through operations or the sale of assets 
diversification in and  we recognized the need to diversify our asset base as part of our strategy 
our strategy has broadened from our primary focus on venezuela to identify  access and integrate hydrocarbon assets to include organic growth through exploration in basins globally with proven hydrocarbon systems 
we seek to leverage our venezuelan experience as well as our recently expanded business development and technical platform to create a diversified resource base 
with the addition of technical resources  opening of our london office  the planned opening of a singapore office  the redeployment of resources from our moscow office as well as our earlier purchase of a percent equity interest in fusion  we have made significant investments to provide the necessary foundation and global reach required for an organic growth focus 
our organic growth is focused on undeveloped or underdeveloped fields  field redevelopments and exploration 
while exploration will become a larger part of our overall portfolio  we will generally restrict ourselves to basins with known hydrocarbon systems and favorable risk reward profiles 
exploration will be technically driven with a low entry cost and high resource potential that provides sustainable growth 
we will continue to seek opportunities where perceived geopolitical risk may provide high reward opportunities in the long term 
we will limit producing property acquisitions as market pricing of

our wab  south china sea asset has been in our portfolio since gabon and indonesia are expected to be additions to our new strategy after receipt of government approvals 
wab  south china sea in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a border dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with another company 
the border dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the wab area due to the dispute 
we continue to have meetings with cnooc to monitor this situation and explore new business opportunities 
dussafu marin  offshore gabon in november  we executed a sale and purchase agreement for the purchase of a percent interest in the dussafu psc 
all conditions precedent to the sale and purchase agreement are complete except for final government and partner approvals 
we anticipate receiving final approvals during the first half of on receipt of final partner approval  we will become the operator of the dussafu psc 
the purchase will be recorded in the quarter in which approvals are received 
located offshore gabon  adjacent to the border with the republic of congo  the dussafu psc contains  acres with water depths to  feet 
the dussafu psc has two small oil discoveries in the gamba and dentale reservoirs and a small natural gas discovery 
production and infrastructure exists in the blocks contiguous to the dussafu psc 
the dussafu psc partners and the republic of gabon recently agreed to enter into the second exploration phase of the psc with an effective date of may  the second exploration phase is a three year work commitment which includes the acquisition and processing of kilometers of d seismic  geology and geophysical interpretation  engineering studies and the drilling of a conditional well 
leads in the underexplored syn rift potential in the m baya and lucina reservoirs that are commercial in immediately adjacent fields have been identified and are expected to be the focus of the planned work program which includes the acquisition and processing of kilometers of d seismic data 
the dussafu psc partners anticipate prospects can be generated to test these play concepts in budong budong  onshore indonesia in february  indonesia s oil and gas regulatory authority  bp migas  approved the assignment to us of a percent interest in the budong psc located onshore west sulawesi  indonesia 
final government approval from migas is pending 
the budong psc includes a ten year exploration period and a year development phase 
in the initial three year exploration phase  which began january  we expect to acquire  process and interpret approximately kilometers of d seismic and drill two exploration wells 
tately will be the operator through the exploration phase as required by the terms of the budong psc 
we will have control of major decisions and financing for the project with an option to operate in the development and production phase if approved by bp migas 
the budong psc covers million acres and includes the lariang and karama sub basins which are the eastern onshore extension of the wsfb 
exploration to date in the basin is immature due to previously difficult jungle terrain  which is now accessible with the development of palm oil plantations and their related infrastructure 
field work performed over the last years  as outcrops have been more accessible  has given a new understanding to the presence of eocene source and reservoir potential that had not previously been recognized 
recent seismic surveys have greatly improved the understanding of the geology and enhanced the prospectivity of the offshore wsfb and  by analogy  the sparsely explored onshore area 
to date  a total of eight leads have been recognized 
it will be necessary to acquire a grid of seismic data to confirm the structures and give an indication of eocene target s within the section and to mature these leads into drillable prospects 
the two identified sub basins lariang and karama provide an opportunity to test prospects in two sub basins

interest expense decreased due to the payment of harvest vinccler s bolivar denominated debt in the year ended december  income tax expense decreased due to the recording of harvest vinccler s prior period tax assessments in the year ended december  and the reversal of deferred income taxes provided on harvest vinccler s deferred revenue 
we have utilized our current united states general and administrative expenses plus our net operating loss carryovers to offset the gains on financing transactions generated during the year ended december  there was no effect on our effective tax rate 

table of contents years ended december  and we reported a net loss of million  or diluted earnings per share  for compared with net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for revenues were lower for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  due to the conversion of the osa to a minority equity interest in petrodelta 
total expenses and other non operating income expense in millions year ended december  increase decrease general and administrative contribution to science and technology fund account receivable write off on retroactive oil price adjustment taxes other than on income investment income and other interest expense net gain loss on exchange rates general and administrative expenses increased due to higher business development costs and employee related expenses 
taxes other than on income decreased due to the elimination of municipal taxes as a result of the conversion of the osa to petrodelta 
interest expense increased due to harvest vinccler s estimated liability for interest of million on the tax assessments as well as increased borrowings to pay the tax assessments 
in october  the executive branch of the venezuelan government issued the regulations for the science and technology law which established the methodology for determining the required investment  contribution or expenditure for the calendar year financial results 
after release of the regulations  harvest vinccler accrued million for the estimated liability for and the first quarter of based on its current understanding of the regulations 
capital resources and liquidity while we can give no assurance  we currently believe that petrodelta will fund its own operations and pay a dividend prior to december   and that our cash on hand will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our exploration and business development expenditures for the next months 
in item a risk factors  we discuss a number of variables and risks related to our investment in petrodelta and exploration projects that could significantly affect our capital resources and liquidity 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to  delays or inability of ppsa to pay for past and future crude oil and natural gas deliveries  the ability to implement petrodelta s business plan  changes in oil prices  fiscal and contractual stability  payment of a petrodelta dividend and the ability to obtain financing for other projects 
we also point out that the total capital required to develop the fields in venezuela may exceed petrodelta s available cash and financing capabilities  and that there may be operational or contractual consequences to this inability 
in addition  our ability to explore and develop growth opportunities outside of venezuela is dependent upon the ability to receive dividends from petrodelta and access debt and equity markets 
the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see item a risk factors 
we require capital principally to fund the exploration and development of new oil and gas properties 
on february   venezuela imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
these controls fix the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivars for us dollars and vice versa 
the bolivar is not readily convertible into the us dollar 
we do not expect the venezuelan currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet short term loan obligations and operating requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in march  venezuela announced that effective january   the currency unit of the monetary system of venezuela will be redenominated to the equivalent of  current bolivars 
this means that the bolivar dropped three zeros effective january  from january   all amounts of money became denominated in a new and smaller scale of bolivars under the temporary name of bol vares fuertes  which after a period of time will bear again the name of bolivars 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
our future rate of capital resource and liquidity growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures 
our ability to acquire and develop growth opportunities outside of venezuela is dependent upon the ability to receive dividends from petrodelta and access debt and equity markets 
debt 
at december   harvest vinccler has debt of billion bolivars approximately million which is secured by million in restricted cash deposited in a us bank 
we have no other debt obligations 
working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the ability of petrodelta to pay dividends 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  in thousands except as indicated net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash working capital current ratio total cash  including restricted cash total debt percent of total debt to capitalization the decrease in working capital of million was primarily due to the inability to reflect a dividend from petrodelta or collect the advances made by harvest vinccler to pdvsa in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the charge in the second and third quarters of of million for additional taxes and related interest for the impact of income tax assessments by the seniat for through first quarter of cash flow from operating activities 
during the years ended december  and  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to the collection of accrued oil and gas sales receivable in the first quarter of which was offset by the charge in the second and third quarters of for the estimated tax assessments and related interest  as well as our inability to reflect a dividend from petrodelta or collect the advances made by harvest vinccler to pdvsa beginning with the second quarter of cash flow from investing activities 
during the years ended december  and  we had limited production related capital expenditures 
the reduction in capital expenditures was due to the continued suspension of our drilling program and the fact that our producing properties are now recognized under the equity method of accounting 
we continued to advance funds during the period prior to the formation of petrodelta for maintenance of the existing wells 
after the formation of petrodelta  capital commitments for petrodelta will be determined by the business plan provided for in the conversion contract and the annual budget approved by the petrodelta board of directors to implement the business plan 
outside of venezuela  our capital commitments to date support our 
table of contents business development efforts and are substantially at our discretion 
during the year ended december   we invested million of investigatory costs in support of our business development 
in january  we purchased a percent interest in fusion for million and hnr finance funded its percent share of petrodelta for million 
during the year ended december   we deposited cash of million as collateral for four loans with venezuelan banks  of which million had been returned to us 
by december   the restricted cash balance was million 
during the year ended december   million of the restricted cash was released and returned to us 
cash flow from financing activities 
during the year ended december   harvest vinccler repaid billion bolivars approximately million of its bolivar denominated debt 
harvest vinccler repaid the debt using a series of exchange transactions more fully described in part iv  item  notes to the consolidated financial statements  note gain on financing transactions 
during the year ended december   harvest vinccler borrowed billion bolivars approximately million for short term bolivar denominated obligations  billion bolivars approximately million and billion bolivars approximately million for the seniat income tax assessments and related interest and billion bolivars approximately million for the seniat income tax assessments and related interest  to refinance previous borrowings and for operational needs 
also during the year ended december   harvest vinccler repaid million of its us dollar debt one payment of million and four payments of million each on the variable rate loans and billion bolivars approximately million of its bolivar debt 
in june  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time through open market transactions 
as of december   million shares had been purchased under the program for million  or an average cost of per share  including commissions 
at december   we had approximately million shares outstanding 
contractual obligations we have a lease obligation of approximately  per month for our houston office space 
this lease runs through april in addition  harvest vinccler has lease obligations for office space in caracas  venezuela for approximately  per month 
this lease runs through december payments in thousands due by period less than after contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt building lease total effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
fluctuations in oil prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
as noted above under capital resources and liquidity  venezuela imposed currency exchange restrictions in february  and adjusted the official exchange rate in february and again in march we do not expect the currency conversion restrictions or the adjustment in the exchange rate to have a material impact on us at this time 
dividends from petrodelta will be denominated in us dollars when paid 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor with respect to results of operations in venezuela 
in march  venezuela announced that effective january   the currency unit of the monetary system of venezuela will be redenominated to the equivalent of  current bolivars 
this means that the bolivar will drop three zeros effective january  from january   all amounts of money will become denominated in a new and smaller scale of bolivars under the temporary name of bol vares fuertes  which after a period of time will bear again the name of bolivars 

table of contents during the years ended december  and  our net foreign exchange gains attributable to our international operations were minimal 
the us dollar and bolivar exchange rates have not been adjusted since march however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  most of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan currency to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
an exemption under the venezuelan criminal exchange law for transactions in certain securities results in an indirect securities transaction market of foreign currency exchange  through which companies may obtain foreign currency legally without requesting it from the venezuelan government 
publicly available quotes do not exist for the securities transaction exchange rate but such rates may be obtained from brokers 
securities transaction markets are used to move financial securities in and out of venezuela 
in october  the government of venezuela announced the application of a new tax on financial transactions the tft to private companies 
the tft does not apply to individuals 
the tax was set at percent of the value of the transaction 
the tft applies to all debits to bank accounts as well as payments of debt outside the banking system and is not tax deductible 
the levy will be applied from november  through december  the tft will not have a material effect on harvest vinccler s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
all intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
investment in equity affiliates the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
in january  we purchased a percent equity interest in fusion 
in october  petrodelta was formed  and the equity in earnings from april  to december  is reflected in the fourth quarter of consolidated statement of operations 
these investments are increased or decreased by earnings losses and decreased by dividends paid 
no dividends were declared or paid by fusion or petrodelta in property and equipment in december  we changed our accounting method for oil and gas exploration and development activities to the successful efforts method from the full cost method 
although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development continues to be an accepted method of accounting for oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting as prescribed by sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies is the preferred method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  financial information for prior periods has been restated to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method 
we believe the successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of our results of operations and the ability to assess our future investments in oil and gas properties for impairment based on their estimated fair values rather than being required to base valuation on prices and costs as of the balance sheet date 
the significant differences between successful efforts and full cost accounting for oil and gas properties relate to the expensing of exploration activities and related unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities 
the expensing of these costs can create volatility in the statement of operations 
the change in accounting principle resulted in a cumulative  non cash increase to retained earnings of million  net of income tax  as of december  retained earnings increased due to the reversal of ceiling test write downs in prior years required under the full cost accounting rules of the sec 
there were no such impairments under the successful efforts accounting rules 
the effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and was a decrease of million and million  net of income tax  or and per diluted share  respectively 
the decrease in 
table of contents income from continuing operations was due to an increase in depletion expense 
there was no effect on cash and cash equivalents 
oil and natural gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive  based on historical experience  is amortized over the average holding period 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
oil and natural gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  conclusive formation test or by certain technical data 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the projects is being made 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization of the cost of proved oil and natural gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the basis for grouping is reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments 
we account for impairments under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
inventory held for use in the exploration for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil reserves are carried at cost with adjustments made from time to time to recognize any reductions in value 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents foreign currency the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency 
amounts denominated in non us currencies are re measured in non us dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the statement of operations 
we attempt to manage our operations in such a manner as to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
however  there are many factors that affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange risk  as discussed below 
oil prices as an independent oil producer  our revenue  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas 

table of contents prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
in august and september  harvest vinccler hedged a portion of its oil sales for calendar year by purchasing two west texas intermediate wti crude oil puts 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
see part iv  item  notes to the consolidated financial statements  note organization and summary of significant accounting policies derivatives and hedging for a complete discussion of our derivative activity 
we had no hedging transactions in place for our or production 
interest rates total short term debt at december  of million consisted of harvest vinccler s bolivar denominated debt  which had a fixed rate for its initial twelve months 
total short term debt at december  of million consisted of harvest vinccler us dollar denominated fixed rate loans 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in the interest rate would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
foreign exchange the bolivar is not readily convertible into the us dollar 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in venezuela  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in that country 
venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls see capital resources and liquidity above
