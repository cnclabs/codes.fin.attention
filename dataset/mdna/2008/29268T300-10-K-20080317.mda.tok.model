item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we manufacture and sell fiber optic and led lighting systems  and our business is involved in two specific markets commercial lighting and pool lighting 
our patented system  used by both product lines  is called the efo system 
the efo system delivers higher energy savings  heat dissipation  and lower maintenance cost 
these features provide a distinct advantage over our competitors products  and we have been able to successfully cater to a niche market 
our products are a good fit for the lighting needs of supermarkets  retail stores  the us navy  museums  and other specialized markets  including but not limited to hotel chains  dock lighting  and casinos 
also  the lighted fiber optic cables  an integral part of the lighting system  are aesthetically pleasing and have been warmly welcomed by design firms 
even though our net sales have been trending downward during the past years  the sales from our efo systems  our patented product  have been progressively improving 
the efo generated sales were  in   in  and  in the efo systems have been well received by architectural and design firms and are now marketed in europe  russia  and the middle east 
in august  our company was awarded the prestigious defense advanced research project agency darpa award for small business innovation 
this award brings awareness in the marketplace about our technological contribution  which we hope will result in increased sales 
in and  a modified version of our efo system was fitted to three navy ships 
this project was funded through a government grant from darpa 
during the first quarter of  we became a subcontractor to the university of delaware for conducting research on very high efficiency solar cells vhesc 
this is a prestigious assignment that we hope will bring awareness about our technological strengths 
trends and uncertainties the following is a summary of trends and uncertainties that affected our financial performance in economic trends during the second half of  the us economy was adversely affected by continued deterioration in the housing market and extraordinary volatility in the fixed income markets 
these problems affected our results in varying degrees 
certain geographic regions were impacted more significantly than others  and this had some influence on the seasonal and regional business conducted by our pool business 
economic decline in the construction industry affected sales negatively in both the pool and commercial lighting markets 
management team during  we experienced turnover in several senior management positions 
we believe that we have a new management team focused on addressing the issues of declining sales and increasing revenue through improved marketing channels while reducing expenses 
we expect our operations to benefit from the expertise of the new leaders who joined our organization in sales plans we introduced a new product category called efo led as part of our efo systems 
initial feedback is that it has been well accepted by the market and is expected to contribute positively to future sales growth 
in  we constructed a new showroom at our headquarters in solon  ohio  to showcase our products to architects and designers 
this effort too will help bolster sales in the future 
we recently entered into partnership with tcp  inc  of aurora  ohio  and eco engineering  llc of cincinnati  ohio  to distribute a broad range of our products to their national customers 
this is a significant step for increasing sales in the future and is in addition to the previously used marketing channels of commission based sales representatives 
we believe that this step will positively affect our sales in the near future 
liquidity due to continued losses and sales declines in  management intends to pursue the raising of additional equity financing in on march   the company raised approximately  in equity financing  net of expenses  in a private placement of shares of common stock and warrants to existing shareholders 
this additional financing will be used to fund working capital  pay debt and perform additional research and development

the decrease in pool lighting sales was due to a  or  drop in sales of in ground pool products and also a  or  decrease in sales of jazz lighting products 
however  jazz lighting products are no longer considered a core product for the future  and the decrease was anticipated 
our sales breakdowns  by product lines  with efo products as a separate line item  are as follows product line breakdown in thousands year ended december  efo traditional pool traditional commercial lighting total efo sales reported in and have been restated for comparability with efo products included in the increased sales of efo products were a result of organic sales growth and the introduction of certain new efo products in these new products were an addition to the existing efo fiber optic product and contributed  or  in sales out of the total efo sales of  in  net sales decreased by to  compared to  in the decrease was a result of lower sales of pool products  excluding efo  of  or  and commercial lighting products of  or  which partially was offset by increased sales of efo products of  or  including  of new efo pool products

borrowings by german subsidiary borrowings under equipment term loan non cancelable operating leases thereafter the company also has  for credit line borrowings  in the united states  recorded as a current liability at december  off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the financial statements 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and expenses if different judgments or different estimates were utilized 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates that we believe have the most significant impact on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  long lived assets  valuation of inventories  accounting for income taxes  and share based compensation revenue recognition revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable  has been earned  and when all of the following has occurred persuasive evidence or an arrangement exists  eg  a sales order  a purchase order  or a sales agreement 
shipment has occurred the standard shipping term is fob ship point or services provided on a percentage of completion basis or installation have been completed 
price to the buyer is fixed or determinable 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sale generally is recognized upon shipping because of the following all sales made by the company to its customer base are non contingent  meaning that they are not tied to that customer s resale of products 
standard terms of sale contain shipping terms of fob ship point  meaning that title is transferred when shipping occurs 
there are no automatic return provisions that allow the customer to return the product in the event that the product does not sell within a defined timeframe 
revenue from installation services  including design and integration services and other services where product sales are not incorporated into the contract  is recognized upon the following percentage of completion method using the ratio of labor cost incurred to the total final estimated labor cost 
under this method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of anticipated revenue that has been earned 
revenue from product sales that incorporate specifically defined installation services is recognized as follows product sale at completion of installation and installation service at completion of installation we warrant our products against defects or workmanship issues 
we set up allowances for estimated returns  discounts  and warranties upon recognition of revenue and these allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated returns  discounts  and warranty expenses 
our distributors obligation to us is not contingent upon the resale of our product and as such does not prohibit revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts  returns  and discounts we establish allowance for doubtful accounts for probable losses  based on past history  current economic conditions  and contractual terms 
the specific components are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable  and allowance for sales returns in  the total allowance was  with  related to accounts receivable and  related to sales return 
in  the total allowance had a balance of  with  related to accounts receivable and  related to sales return 
the company reviews these allowance accounts periodically and adjusts them according to current conditions 
long lived assets the company has  in goodwill in  which represents of total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  and at december   it was determined that no impairment occurred 
the first test for impairment requires us to make an assessment of our book value versus our market capitalization value 
since our market value was greater than book value  no further impairment testing was required 
if these values change in the future  additional analysis would be required  and we may incur non cash charges for impairment of goodwill 
valuation of inventories we state inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost determined using the first in first out method or market 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
during   and  we charged   and  respectively  to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventories 
adjustments to our estimates  such as forecasted sales and expected product lifecycles  could harm our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then must assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not certain or is unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united states and germany  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based upon our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
share based payments in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised or fas r  share based payments 
fas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments  such as stock options granted to employees

 share based payment sab  which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between fas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
it also provides the sec staff s views regarding valuation of share based payment arrangements 
the application of fas r with sab had the effect of increasing stock based compensation expense and reducing earnings by  in and  in we measure all employee stock based awards as an expense based on the grant date fair value of these awards 
effective january   we began to recognize expense for all stock based awards granted on or after that date and for all previous unvested awards using the modified prospective method 
the fair value of options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
weighted average assumptions used in the model include the expected life of the options  volatility  and risk free interest rate 
the volatility estimates are calculated using historical pricing experience
