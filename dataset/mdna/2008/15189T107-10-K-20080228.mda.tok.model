a february conversion notice by a holder of million principal amount of our convertible 
table of contents senior notes is expected to result in a march conversion and settlement with a cash payment for the principal amount and delivery of shares of our common stock for the excess value due the converting holder 
transition bonds pursuant to a financing order issued by the texas utility commission in september  in february a subsidiary of centerpoint houston issued approximately million in transition bonds in two tranches with interest rates of and and final maturity dates in february and february  respectively 
scheduled final payment dates are february and february through issuance of the transition bonds  centerpoint houston securitized transition property of approximately million representing the remaining balance of the competition transition charge ctc less an environmental refund as reduced by the fuel reconciliation settlement amount 
recovery of true up balance in december  the texas third court of appeals issued its decision in the appeal of the final order true up order issued by the texas utility commission to centerpoint houston 
in its decision  the court of appeals reversed the district court s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity auction true up amounts  reversed the district court s judgment to the extent it upheld the texas utility commission s decision to allow centerpoint houston to recover excess mitigation credits emcs paid to reliant energy  inc rri  ordered that the tax normalization issue be remanded to the texas utility commission  and affirmed the district court s judgment in all other respects 
centerpoint houston and two other parties filed motions for rehearing with the court of appeals 
in the event that the motions for rehearing are not resolved in a manner favorable to it  centerpoint houston intends to seek further review by the texas supreme court 
although we and centerpoint houston believe that centerpoint houston s true up request is consistent with applicable statutes and regulations and accordingly that it is reasonably possible that it will be successful in its further appeals  we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate rulings by the courts on the issues to be considered in the various appeals or with respect to the ultimate decision by the texas utility commission on the tax normalization issue 
to reflect the impact of the true up order  in and we recorded a net after tax extraordinary loss of million 
no amounts related to the district court s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
however  if the court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of the pending motions for rehearing or on further review by the texas supreme court  we anticipate that we would be required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision 
the amount of that loss would depend on several factors  including ultimate resolution of the tax normalization issue and the calculation of interest on any amounts centerpoint houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is required to refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the true up order  but could range from million to million  plus interest subsequent to december  interstate pipeline expansion carthage to perryville 
in april  centerpoint energy gas transmission cegt  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp  completed phase one construction of a mile  inch diameter pipeline and related compression facilities for the transportation of gas from carthage  texas to cegt s perryville hub in northeast louisiana 
on may   cegt began service under its firm transportation agreements with shippers of approximately million cubic feet mmcf per day 
cegt s second phase of the project  which involved adding compression that increased the total capacity of the pipeline to approximately bcf per day  was placed into service in august cegt has signed firm contracts for the full capacity of phases one and two 
in may  cegt received federal energy regulatory commission ferc approval for the third phase of the project to expand capacity of the pipeline to bcf per day by adding additional compression and operating at 
table of contents higher pressures  and in july  cegt received approval from the pipeline and hazardous materials administration phmsa to increase the maximum allowable operating pressure 
the phmsa s approval contained certain conditions and requirements  which cegt expects to satisfy in the first quarter of cegt has executed contracts for approximately mmcf per day of the mmcf per day phase three expansion 
the third phase is projected to be in service in the second quarter of sesh 
in june  centerpoint energy southeast pipelines holding  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp  and a subsidiary of spectra energy corp 
spectra formed a joint venture  sesh  to construct  own and operate a mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately bcf per day that will extend from cegt s perryville hub in northeast louisiana to an interconnection in southern alabama with gulfstream natural gas system  which is owned by an affiliate of spectra 
we account for our interest in sesh as an equity investment 
in  sesh signed agreements with shippers for firm transportation services  which subscribed capacity of million cubic feet per day 
additionally  sesh and southern natural gas sng have executed a definitive agreement that provides for sng to jointly own the first miles of the pipeline 
under the agreement  sng will own an undivided interest in the portion of the pipeline from perryville  louisiana to an interconnect with sng in mississippi 
the pipe diameter was increased from inches to inches  thereby increasing the initial capacity of bcf per day by mmcf per day to accommodate sng 
sesh will own assets providing approximately bcf per day of capacity as initially planned and will maintain economic expansion opportunities in the future 
sng will own assets providing mmcf per day of capacity  and the agreement provides for a future compression expansion that will increase the jointly owned capacity up to mmcf per day  subject to ferc approval 
an application to construct  own and operate the pipeline was filed with the ferc in december in september  the ferc issued the certificate authorizing the construction of the pipeline 
this ferc approval does not include the expansion capacity that would take sng to mmcf per day 
sesh began construction in november sesh expects to complete construction of the pipeline as approved by the ferc in the second half of sesh s net costs after sng s contribution are estimated to have increased to approximately billion

as of december   the convertible senior notes discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements have been included as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets because the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the third quarter of was greater than or equal to of the conversion price of the convertible senior notes and therefore  during the fourth quarter of  the convertible senior notes meet the criteria that make them eligible for conversion at the option of the holders of these notes 
in  we issued million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately million upon conversion of approximately million principal amount of our convertible senior notes 
subsequent to december   we have issued million shares of our common stock and paid cash of approximately million upon conversion of approximately million principal amount of our convertible senior notes 
a february conversion notice by a holder of million principal amount of our convertible senior notes is expected to result in a march conversion and settlement with a cash payment for the principal amount and delivery of shares of our common stock for the excess value due the converting holder 
arkansas public service commission apsc  affiliate transaction rulemaking proceeding 
in december  the apsc adopted new rules governing affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in arkansas 
in february  in response to requests by cerc and other gas and electric utilities operating in arkansas  the apsc granted reconsideration of the rules and stayed their operation in order to permit additional consideration 
in may  the apsc adopted revised rules  which incorporated many revisions proposed by the utilities  the arkansas attorney general and the apsc staff 
the revised rules prohibit affiliated financing transactions for purposes not related to utility operations  but permit the continuation of existing money pool and multi jurisdictional financing arrangements such as those currently in place at cerc 
non financial affiliate transactions generally have to be priced under an asymmetrical pricing formula under which utilities would receive the better of cost or market pricing for goods and services provided to or from the utility operations 
however  corporate services provided at fully allocated cost such as those provided by service companies are exempt 
the rules also restrict utilities from engaging in businesses other than utility and utility related businesses if the total book value of non utility businesses exceeds of the book value of the utility and its affiliates 
however  existing businesses are grandfathered under the revised rules 
the revised rules also permit utilities to petition for waivers of financing and non financial rules that would otherwise be applicable to their transactions 
the apsc s revised rules impose record keeping  record access  employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions  including notification to the apsc of the formation of new affiliates that will engage in transactions with the utility and annual certification by the utility s president or chief executive officer and its chief financial officer of compliance with the rules 
in addition  the revised rules require a report to the apsc in the event the utility s bond rating is downgraded in certain circumstances 
although the revised rules impose new requirements on cerc s operations in arkansas  at this time neither we nor cerc anticipate that the revised rules will have an adverse effect on existing operations in arkansas 
in september  gas operations made a filing with the apsc in accordance with the revised rules to document existing practices that would be covered by grandfathering provisions of those rules 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases and the guaranties described below  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
prior to the distribution of our ownership in reliant energy  inc rri to our shareholders  cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri s trading subsidiary 
under the terms of the 
table of contents separation agreement between the companies  rri agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation  but at the time of separation in september  rri had been unable to extinguish all obligations 
to secure cerc against obligations under the remaining guaranties  rri agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of cerc  and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties 
in february  we and cerc made a formal demand on rri in connection with one of the two remaining guaranties under procedures provided by the master separation agreement  dated december   between reliant energy and rri 
that demand sought to resolve a disagreement with rri over the amount of security rri is obligated to provide with respect to this guaranty 
in december  we  cerc and rri amended the agreement relating to the security to be provided by rri for these guaranties  pursuant to which cerc released the million in letters of credit rri had provided as security  and rri agreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure cerc against exposure under the remaining guaranties as calculated under the new agreement if and to the extent changes in market conditions exposed cerc to a risk of loss on those guaranties 
the remaining exposure to cerc under the guaranties relates to payment of demand charges related to transportation contracts 
the present value of the demand charges under those transportation contracts  which will be effective until  was approximately million as of december  rri continues to meet its obligations under the contracts  and we believe current market conditions make those contracts valuable in the near term and that additional security is not needed at this time 
however  changes in market conditions could affect the value of those contracts 
if rri should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if rri should fail to provide security in the event market conditions change adversely  our exposure to the counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security provided by rri

we cannot assure you that these ratings  or the credit ratings set forth below in impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings  will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies

senior unsecured debt baa stable bbb positive bbb stable a stable outlook from moody s indicates that moody s does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed 
an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a stable outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our billion credit facility  centerpoint houston s million credit facility and cerc corp 
s million credit facility 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
additionally  a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments 
in september  we issued zens having an original principal amount of billion of which million remain outstanding 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc common stock tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common equal to approximately of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the zens notes and tw common shares become current tax obligations when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common shares are sold 
a tax obligation of approximately million relating to our original issue discount deductions on the zens would have been payable if all of the zens had been exchanged for cash on december  the ultimate tax obligation related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes 
centerpoint energy services  inc ces  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp 
operating in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states 
in order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry  including those pertaining to credit thresholds 
typically  the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces 
to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold  ces is not obligated to provide collateral 
mark to market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces 
as of december   the amount posted as collateral amounted to approximately million 
should the credit ratings of cerc corp 
as the credit support provider for ces fall below certain levels  ces would be required to provide additional collateral on two business days notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly 
table of contents lower 
in addition  cerc corp 
and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of million based on cerc corp 
s s p senior unsecured long term debt rating of bbb 
upgrades and downgrades from this bbb rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly 
in connection with the development of sesh s mile pipeline project  cerc corp 
has committed that it will advance funds to the joint venture or cause funds to be advanced for its share of the cost to construct the pipeline 
cerc corp 
also agreed to provide a letter of credit in an amount up to million for its share of funds that have not been advanced in the event s p reduces cerc corp 
s bond rating below investment grade before cerc corp 
has advanced the required construction funds 
however  cerc corp 
is relieved of these commitments i to the extent of of any borrowing agreements that the joint venture has obtained and maintains for funding the construction of the pipeline and ii to the extent cerc corp 
or its subsidiary participating in the joint venture obtains committed borrowing agreements pursuant to which funds may be borrowed and used for the construction of the pipeline 
a similar commitment has been provided by the other party to the joint venture 
as of december   subsidiaries of cerc corp 
have advanced approximately million to sesh  of which million was in the form of an equity contribution and million was in the form of a loan 
cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default 
in addition  six outstanding series of our senior notes  aggregating billion in principal amount as of december   provide that a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million  will cause a default 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including gas purchases  gas price and weather hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments  particularly given gas price levels and volatility  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities  various regulatory actions  the ability of rri and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of centerpoint houston and in respect of rri s indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which cerc is a guarantor  slower customer payments and increased write offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions  cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent conversion rights of holders of convertible debt  the outcome of litigation brought by and against us  contributions to benefit plans  restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes  and various other risks identified in risk factors in item a of this report

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
our electric transmission distribution business applies sfas no 
 which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our former electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of sfas no 
with respect to our electric transmission distribution business segment relate to million of recoverable electric generation related regulatory assets as of december  these costs are recoverable under the provisions of the texas electric choice plan 
based on our analysis of the final order issued by the texas utility commission  we recorded an after tax charge to earnings in of approximately million to write down our electric generation related regulatory assets to their realizable value  which was reflected as an extraordinary loss 
based on subsequent orders received from the texas utility commission  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after tax in related to the regulatory asset 
additionally  a district court in travis county  texas issued a judgment which would have had the effect of restoring approximately million  plus interest  of disallowed costs 
centerpoint houston and other parties appealed the district court s judgment to the texas third court of appeals  which issued its decision in december in its decision  the court of appeals reversed the district court s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity auction true up amounts  reversed the district court s judgment to the extent it upheld the texas utility commission s decision to allow centerpoint houston to recover emcs paid to rri  ordered that the tax normalization issue be remanded to the texas utility commission  and affirmed the district court s judgment in all other respects 

table of contents centerpoint houston and two other parties filed motions for rehearing with the court of appeals 
in the event that the motions for rehearing are not resolved in a manner favorable to it  centerpoint houston intends to seek further review by the texas supreme court 
although we and centerpoint houston believe that centerpoint houston s true up request is consistent with applicable statutes and regulations and accordingly that it is reasonably possible that it will be successful in its further appeals  we can provide no assurance as to the ultimate rulings by the courts on the issues to be considered in the various appeals or with respect to the ultimate decision by the texas utility commission on the tax normalization issue 
to reflect the impact of the true up order  in and we recorded a net after tax extraordinary loss of million 
no amounts related to the district court s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
however  if the court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of the pending motions for rehearing or on further review by the texas supreme court  we anticipate that we would be required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision 
the amount of that loss would depend on several factors  including ultimate resolution of the tax normalization issue and the calculation of interest on any amounts centerpoint houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is required to refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the true up order  but could range from million to million  plus interest subsequent to december  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of july  unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  interest rates  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
asset retirement obligations we account for our long lived assets under sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
fin 
sfas no 
and fin require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in the same period  the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
rate regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with sfas no 
and fin  and costs recovered through the ratemaking process 
we estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components inflation adjustment the estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor  equipment  materials  and other disposal costs  discount rate the estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium  and third party markup adjustments internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset 

table of contents changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under sfas no 
and fin for example  if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate by basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage 
at december   our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately million 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers 
however  the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded 
please read other significant matters pension plans for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements see note o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
other significant matters pension plans 
as discussed in note p to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory qualified pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa and the internal revenue code 
we made no contribution to the qualified pension plans in and the minimum funding requirements for these plans did not require contribution for the respective years 
additionally  we maintain an unfunded non qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated 
employer contributions for the non qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires us  as the sponsor of a plan  to a recognize on our balance sheets as an asset a plan s over funded status or as a liability such plan s under funded status  b measure a plan s assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
as of december   we recorded a regulatory asset of million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive income of million  net of tax 
at december   the market value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans by million 
changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions 
pension expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in addition  included in the costs for is less than million of expense related to texas genco participants 
pension expense for texas genco participants is reflected in our statement of consolidated income as discontinued operations 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   our qualified pension plan had an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of december  we believe that our actual asset allocation  on average  will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a increase from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
as of december   pension plan assets exceed the projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan by million 
however  if the discount rate was lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december  by million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in of million  net of tax 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding long term debt  bank loans  lease obligations  treasury rate lock derivative instruments and our obligations under our zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
our floating rate obligations aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would increase by approximately million annually 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities and trust preferred securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as of december   we had treasury rate lock derivative instruments with million of notional value and expiration dates of june  to hedge the risk of changes in the year us treasury rate prior to the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt in as of december   the treasury lock derivative instruments could be terminated at a cost of million 
the treasury rate lock derivative instruments qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 and are marked to market in our consolidated balance sheets with changes reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a decrease of in the december  level of interest rates on year us treasury notes would

as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  upon adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   the zens obligation was bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  was a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  a million recorded liability at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated income and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on our zens obligation and our historical accounting treatment of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income 
commodity price risk from non trading activities we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
at december   the recorded fair value of our non trading energy derivatives was a net liability of million 
the net liability consisted of an million net liability associated with price stabilization activities of our natural gas distribution business segment and a net liability of million related to our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment 
net assets or liabilities related to the price stabilization activities correspond directly with net over under recovered gas cost liabilities or assets on the balance sheet 
an increase of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have increased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives net liability by million 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions 
we have a risk oversight committee composed of corporate and business segment officers that oversees our commodity price  weather and credit risk activities  including our trading  marketing  risk management services and hedging activities 
the committee s duties are to establish commodity risk policies  allocate risk capital within limits established by our board of directors  approve trading of new products and commodities  monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with our risk management policies and procedures and trading limits established by our board of directors 
our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments 
a leveraged financial instrument  for this purpose  is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument
