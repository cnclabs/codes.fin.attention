overview we are a new jersey biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes issued patents in the us and more than other patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
we continue to manufacture and commercialize leukoscan in territories where regulatory approvals have been granted 
as of june   research and development into diagnostic product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
from inception in until june  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and have never earned a profit 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  or fda  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
we account for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we concluded that the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa  the ucb agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in january  ucb  sa or ucb decided to stop further new patient enrollment into the sle clinical trials designed and initiated by us 
investigators were advised by ucb of this decision  and protocol amendments were submitted to institutional review boards to seek approval to treat patients with sle who demonstrated clinical benefit in these trials 
during the three month period ended march   ucb and its experts in the field of sle believed that the existing clinical trial protocols should be revised  including potential changes to patient enrollment criteria as such changes may result in more rapid patient enrollment 
as a result of the ucb decision to terminate the two phase iii sle trials  we are no longer able to determine when these clinical trials will take place nor can it determine how these decisions will impact its obligation period under the terms of the agreement with ucb 
accordingly  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing to revenue the deferred revenue recorded with the receipt of the up front payments from ucb at the inception of the license agreement until such time as the obligation period is reasonably determinable 
we have been advised by ucb that it remains committed to developing epratuzumab for the treatment of sle 
the obligation period estimate will be re evaluated when ucb makes a determination as to the next phase iii sle clinical trials 
payments received under contracts to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed 
payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where the company has continuing involvement in the agreement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of mutually agreed milestones  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
to date  we have not recorded any revenue for milestone payments under the ucb agreement 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
marketable securities we hold a number of interest bearing auction rate securities  or ars  that represent investments in pools of assets 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
ars have long term scheduled maturities  but have interest rates that are typically reset at pre determined intervals  every days for the securities purchased by us  at which time the securities can typically be purchased or sold  creating a liquid market 
due to an active secondary market for such investments  the rate reset for each instrument is an opportunity to accept the reset rate or sell the instrument at its face value in order to seek an alternative investment 
in the past  the auction process has allowed investors to roll over their holdings or obtain immediate liquidity by selling the securities at par 
we do not intend to hold these securities to maturity  but rather to use the interest rate reset feature to provide the opportunity to maximize returns while preserving liquidity 
these securities are classified as short term investments in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the ars held are all aaa rated collateralized by student loans  guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and backed by insurance companies 
to date we have collected all interest payable on all ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
as of june   we held six auction rate securities with a par value of million  and these securities are classified as short term investments on the consolidated balance sheet 
until february  the auction rate securities market was highly liquid 
during the week of february   a substantial number of auctions failed  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
the continued uncertainties in the credit markets have affected our holdings in ars investments as the auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
we reviewed ars for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
this treatment is appropriate when a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and a company has the ability to hold the investment until a recovery in market value takes place 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and results in a charge to earnings for the applicable accounting period 
in evaluating the impairment of our ars  we classified such impairments as an other than temporary impairment 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the intent and our ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
as a result of our assessment of a number of factors  including without limitation  market conditions and the credit quality of these securities  we determined that the estimated fair value no longer approximates par value  although we continue to earn interest on the current auction rate security investments at the maximum contractual rate 
accordingly  we have recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million to reduce the value of the ars to their estimated fair value of million 
we estimated the fair value of these ars using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of june  the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include i estimates for the investment s contractual bond coupon rates  ii the market yield interest rates and iii the effective maturity period which is the period the auctions are expected to resume its normal function 
if our estimates regarding the fair value of these securities are inaccurate  a future other than temporary impairment charge may be required 
additionally  these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions and  as such  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses for impairment if we determine there are further declines in fair value 
foreign currency risks for subsidiaries outside of the united states that operate in a local currency environment  income and expense items are translated to united states dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year  assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in the determination of comprehensive loss 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net loss 
stock based compensation we currently have an employee share option plan  or the plan  which permits the grant of share options and shares to our employees for up to million shares of common stock 
a summary of this plan is provided in note we believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant  those option awards generally vest based on four years of continuous service and have seven year contractual terms 
certain options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the plan 
the fair value of each option granted during the years ended june   and is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in the following table years ended june  expected dividend yield expected option term years expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate the weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during the years ended june   and were  and per share  respectively 
we use historical data to estimate employee forfeitures  which for the fiscal year was for employees  for executive officers and for outside directors within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected stock price volatility was calculated on ten year daily stock trading history 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have  non vested options and restricted stock units outstanding 
as of june  and june  there was  and  respectively  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is being recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the weighted average remaining contractual terms of the exercisable shares is years and years as of june  and june   respectively 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost includes the fair value of awards originally accounted for under apb no 
that were not vested on july  and compensation cost for all share based compensation granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
due to the accelerated vesting prior to the adoption of sfas r noted above  the impact on the statement of operations for the year ended june  was not material 
impairment of assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of our ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
life insurance policies split dollar life policy in september  the company had entered into a split dollar life insurance arrangement with dr 
goldenberg and a trust controlled by his family the trust pursuant to which the company had agreed to pay a significant portion of the premiums on a whole life insurance policy insuring dr 
goldenberg and owned by and benefiting the trust 
the company would be repaid the lesser of the cumulative premium payments it has made with respect to the policy or the cash surrender value of the policy upon dr 
goldenberg s death or the voluntary termination of the arrangement by dr 
goldenberg out of the policies existing surrender value at the time of repayment 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for collateral assignment split dollar life insurance  an employer should recognize a liability for any post employment benefit in accordance with apb opinion no 
associated with split dollar life insurance plans 
since the contractual terms of the arrangement provide that the company may not be reimbursed the premiums of the policy upon termination of employment  the company accrued a liability for a post employment benefit  which was based on a number of assumptions 
the measurement of the related benefit was based on a number of probability weighted assumptions 
the more significant of these assumptions were a the appropriate discount rate to use in computing the present value of the benefit  b the expected return on cash surrender values  c the estimated retirement date  and d the expected period of time after employment and prior to the death benefit 
actual results will likely differ from the assumptions used 
those differences  along with changes made in the assumptions used from period to period  would impact the amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company had recognized an asset based on the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract as of the date of each balance sheet 
the amount the company could realize was the lesser of the premiums paid by the company or the cash surrender value of the policy 
other life insurance policies the company has various other life insurance policies on dr 
goldenberg  some of the policies are for the benefit of the company and some of the policies were previously for the benefit of dr 
goldenberg 
when the company is the beneficiary of the policy  and there are no other contractual arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg  the company recognizes the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement as an asset in the balance sheet 
when the company was the owner of the policy  but had contractually agreed to give dr 
goldenberg rights to the policy  the company would record both an asset for the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement  and a corresponding liability that represented the value contractually benefiting dr 
goldenberg 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of  or 
there were no license fee and other revenue for the fiscal year compared to  for the fiscal year 
the current fiscal year did not include any amortization of deferred revenues due to the decision by ucb in february to stop patient enrollment into the sle clinical trials  as discussed in our critical accounting policy

see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other than temporary impairment charge 
interest and other income for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to the sale of four executive life insurance contracts which were no longer deemed to be necessary resulting in  of other income 
interest expense decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this decrease resulted primarily from the conversion of the senior convertible notes into the company s common stock during the fiscal year 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of  and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of  for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of  and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of  the tax benefits for and fiscal years were also partially offset by new jersey state income tax provisions of  and  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or  primarily due to the impact of the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue from the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa the ucb agreement  as well as higher product sales 
product sales of  for the fiscal year were  higher  primarily due to higher sales in europe than in the prior year due to having the leukoscan product available for the entire fiscal year 
on january  approval was received from the european regulatory agency to market leukoscan for the revision to our manufacturing process 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year increased to  from  for the same period in  primarily from the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue earned under the ucb agreement 
total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year declined by  or  to  from  in fiscal year due primarily to the transfer of the sle clinical trials to ucb as part of the ucb agreement

sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  the decline in marketing expenses was due to the continued de emphasis of the diagnostic product line 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  this decrease was primarily due to a charge of  for fees associated with the ucb agreement in the fiscal year and the reduction in fiscal of certain legal expenses of approximately  interest and other income for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher levels of investments the result of the cash received from the ucb agreement in may and sale of shares of common stock in may as well as higher interest rates 
interest expense decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this decrease resulted primarily from the conversion of the senior convertible notes  due may  or the notes  from the previous fiscal year and the conversion of the remaining notes in fiscal for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively

net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our product candidates in development were  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses increased by  in or as compared to research and development expenses decreased by  in or as compared to we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple product candidates at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consists of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  in thousands research costs product development costs total research costs research costs in total increased by  or for the year ended june  research costs in total decreased by  or for the year ended june  as compared to the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  from this decrease was a result of the usage of the replenishment of supplies from the previous year and from the company s cost savings efforts during the fiscal year 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or over the increase in spending in was to replenish supplies that were utilized during but not purchased due to cost control efforts implemented by the company prior to the ucb agreement in may personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to this increase was a result of an increase to the employee headcount to offset the previous years attrition 
personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to these declines resulted primarily from employee attrition and cost savings efforts during the year 
patent expenses for were  an increase of  or over the increase was primarily due to higher professional fees for patent filings and support 
animal studies conducted by outside organizations in were  a decrease of  or from  as testing for toxicity studies for compounds in the preclinical stage were reduced on the current status of product development 
product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total increased by  or as compared to product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by  or as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or over the reduction in these expenses were primarily the result of the closure of a number of clinical trials that were either completed or which the company decided it was no longer going to pursue 
clinical trial expenses in were  a decrease of  or over this decrease is primarily the result of the transfer of the phase iii clinical trials for sle to ucb  effective may   with ucb responsible for the investigator fee and all other expenses associated with these phase iii trials 
personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to this increase was primarily a result of an increase to the employee headcount to offset the previous years attrition and to provide for increased product development and quality control efforts 
personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to this decrease was primarily due to employee attrition during the year  partially as a result of the transfer of the phase iii clinical trials to ucb in may patent expenses for were  an increase of  or over patent expenses for were  an increase of  or over the increase for was primarily due to higher professional fees incurred for patent litigation defense 
the increase in the fiscal year was primarily for professional fees for patent filings and support 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or over the increase for was primarily the result of increased production development efforts over the previous year 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or over the reduction for was a result of delayed production of clinical antibodies as part of cost control efforts in and and lower demand of the clinical trials with the transfer of the phase iii clinical trials for sle in may expenses for outside testing were  in  and increase of  or over this increase was primarily for procedures performed for testing for product safety and validations for manufacturing process 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient follow up in light of trials results  the number of clinical sites required for trials and  the number of patients that ultimately participate 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of our equity securities  revenue earned and cash received under licensing agreements and  to a lesser degree  from sales of cea scan and leukoscan  research grants from various sources and investment income 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  despite the loss on operations of million for the current year  the net cash used in operations was million lower than the loss on operations due to non cash charges  primarily the million impairment charge on marketable securities  million of depreciation expense and million of stock compensation expense 
in addition we received million for the cash surrender value from the termination of executive life insurance policies in fiscal for the fiscal year  the net cash used in operations was million higher than the million loss on operations 
this decline resulted from the million non cash deferred revenue and the payment of million for accrued legal fee  partially offset by the interest expense paid for with common stock million  depreciation expense million and increase in deferred compensation  million 
the decline in the cash flow used in operations of million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million provided from operations in fiscal year ended june  was primarily the result of the cash receipt of million from the ucb agreement in may  partially offset by reduced spending in fiscal year for the clinical trials that were assumed by ucb and higher levels of interest income 
cash flows from investing 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  was million compared to million of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  the increase in cash flow from investing for was the result of the sale of million of marketable securities necessary to fund operations in addition to the use of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in fiscal year the company purchased million of marketable securities utilizing a portion of the million of proceeds received from the ucb agreement in may the cash received from investing activities in the fiscal year ended june  was derived from the sale of marketable securities to fund operations prior to the completion of the ucb agreement 
cash flows from financing 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  was million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended june  the cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year was for the payment of debt 
the cash provided from financing activities in the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of common stock of million in may  which more than offset the payment of debt for the year 
the million of cash flow provided by financing activities in fiscal year was higher than the million provided by financing activities in fiscal year there was no corresponding equity sale of securities in the fiscal year  however  the company did receive million held in escrow from the sales of senior convertible notes that had been issued in the fiscal year 
at june   we had working capital of  representing a decline of  from  at june  the decline in current assets was primarily due to the reduction of our cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million to fund our loss from operations 
marketable securities also declined due to the million impairment charge for our auction rate securities 
this decrease was partially offset by the cash receipts of million for the cash surrender value from the termination of an executive life insurance policy 
at june   there was no long term debt  as a result of the payment of the remaining portion of the new jersey economic development authority during the fiscal year 
on june   the company obtained a line of credit for a period of up to one year at an interest rate of libor plus or at june   for up to million with a financial institution  secured by the auction rate securities 
as of june  no borrowings had occurred by the company under this line of credit 
in august  the obligations of the parties under this agreement were terminated 
on july   we entered into the nycomed agreement providing nycomed gmbh an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  and commercialize veltuzumab  our humanized anti cd antibody  in the subcutaneous formulation  for the treatment of all non cancer indications 
under the terms of the nycomed agreement  we retain the right to develop veltuzumab in the field of oncology 
in addition  we will continue our ongoing phase i ii study in immune thrombocytopenic purpura  or itp and nycomed will reimburse us for all expenses incurred in connection with this study 
the nycomed agreement also provides us with an option to co promote veltuzumab for the treatment of itp in the united states 
under the terms of the nycomed agreement  on august  we received initial cash payments totaling million before fees 
our cash and cash equivalents of  and marketable securities of  totaled  at june   representing a decrease of  from  at june  this reduction was primarily attributable to our use of cash in operations and the million impairment charge to our auction rate securities  partially offset by the sales of proceeds of  for executive life insurance policies 
we hold a variety of ars that represent investments in pools of assets 
these ars investments were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals that allowed investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets over the last six months affected all of our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to all of the ars investments are investment grade quality and were consistent with our investment policy at the time of acquisition 
previously the fair value of ars investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of june  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of june  we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of million  which was deemed an other than temporary impairment 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record additional other impairment charges in future periods 
we continue to monitor the market for ars transactions and consider their impact if any on the fair value of our investments  see note  concentration of credit risk 
with the million of cash proceeds from the nycomed agreement received on august   we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements in fiscal year are expected to be at a higher level than in fiscal year due to increased spending for research and development activities 
however  research and development activities are expected to continue to expand over time and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to complete our research and development compounds in our development pipeline in line with our corporate strategy 
as a result  we will continue to require additional financial resources in order to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of product candidates and regulatory filings 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
there can be no assurance that immunomedics will be able to raise the additional capital it will need on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
if we were unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item a risk factors  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us  and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities

 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the eitf concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and other accounting literature 
based on the nature of the arrangement  payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and its terms  the nature of the entity s business  and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented 
companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however  required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
during the early part of  liquidity issues began to affect the global credit and capital markets 
as a result  securities known as auction rate securities ars  which historically have had a liquid market and had their interest rates reset periodically eg monthly through dutch auctions  began to fail at auction 
these auction failures have caused ars to become illiquid since investors are hesitant to purchase these types of investments  which in turn has caused the fair market values for these securities to decline 
as of june   the company has million invested in ars with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each month 
these monthly auctions have historically provided a liquid market for these securities 
the company s investments in ars all currently have aaa aaa credit ratings and interest continues to be paid by the issuers of the securities 
the ars held are all aaa rated collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and backed by insurance companies 
as a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  certain of the ars  with a total principal value of million held by the company at june   have experienced multiple failed auctions since february the estimated fair market value at june   of the company s ars with continuing auction failures totaled approximately million 
the company estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of its investment in ars as of june  the company reviews for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
this treatment is appropriate when a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and the company has the intent and ability to hold the investment until a recovery in market value takes place 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
the company determined that the entire impairment related to its ars was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge in other income expense on its consolidated statements of operations 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio in marketable securities as of june  expected maturity date and thereafter total fair value in thousands variable rate average interest rate we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in regards to certain agreements with service providers relating to certain clinical trials that are in process 
depending on the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  realized and unrealized currency fluctuations could be significant
