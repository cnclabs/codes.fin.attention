overview we are a leading designer  producer and brand manager of innovative  high quality footwear and the category creator in the sport sandal  luxury sheepskin  and sustainable footwear segments 
we market our products under three proprietary brands teva high performance sport sandals and rugged outdoor footwear and accessories  ugg authentic luxury sheepskin boots and a full line of luxury and comfort footwear and accessories  and simple innovative sustainable lifestyle footwear and accessories 
in  we embarked on a strategy to license our footwear brands to complementary products outside of footwear  generally in the apparel and accessories categories 
we currently have eight licensing agreements with five licensees for the teva and ugg brands combined 
we record licensing revenues and expenses within their respective brand 
the activity is very small in relation to the consolidated operations  and we do not expect significant incremental net sales and profits from licensing in the near future 
we sell our three brands through our quality domestic retailers and international distributors and directly to our end user consumers through our ecommerce business and our retail stores 
we sell our footwear in both the domestic market and in international markets 
independent third parties manufacture all of our products 
our business has been impacted by several important trends affecting our end markets the markets for casual  outdoor and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our customers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
by emphasizing our brand image and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some of the important factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
teva brand overview from fiscal to  wholesale net sales of teva brand products increased at a compound annual growth rate of 
however  for fiscal years and  wholesale net sales of teva products decreased by approximately and  respectively  compared to the year ago periods 
we attribute this decline in sales primarily to a prolonged period of weak product innovation  coupled with a significant increase in competitor activity 
we began to address this situation in by dedicating significantly greater resources to product planning  design  and development  and through aggressive marketing 
we also repositioned the teva brand to a younger target consumer 
for the year ended december   wholesale net sales of teva products increased by approximately  and net sales of teva products including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales increased by approximately  compared to the same period in we see a continuing shift in consumer preferences and lifestyles to include more outdoor recreational activities 
the teva brand has remained popular among professional and amateur outdoor enthusiasts  who consider the brand authentic and performance oriented 
our spring product line was over new  and included innovative technical performance styles  as well as new colors and fresh new casual styles  which target a new generation of young outdoor athletes and enthusiasts 
likewise  our spring and fall product lines include new product introductions 
we intend to explore opportunities to broaden the teva brand s distribution with image enhancing retailers beyond our core outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels 
through effective channel management  we plan to expand into new distribution channels without diluting our outdoor heritage and our appeal to outdoor enthusiasts 
through appropriate channel product line expansion  we plan to further broaden our product offerings beyond sport sandals to new products that meet the style and functional needs of our consumers 
ugg brand overview the ugg brand has been a well known brand in california for many years and over the past few years has become a recognized brand throughout the remainder of the country as well as internationally 
over the past few years  our ugg brand has received increased media exposure including increased print media in national ads and co op advertising with our customers  which has contributed to broader public awareness of the ugg brand and significantly increased demand for ugg brand products 
we believe that the increased media focus and demand for ugg brand products was driven by the following consumer brand loyalty  due to the luxury and comfort of ugg brand footwear  increased marketing in high end magazines  successfully targeting high end distribution  adoption by high profile film and television celebrities as a favored footwear brand  increased media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have normally been able to  continued geographic expansion across the us and internationally  and continued addition of new product categories 
we believe the luxury and comfort features of ugg brand products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg brand footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy  we have increased our product offering to approximately styles for men  women and children for the fall season 
this product line expansion includes an ever growing spring line  an expanded men s line  as well as a fall line that consists of a range of luxurious collections for both genders 
these collections include new fashion collections  a variety of casual comfort collections  cold weather offerings  as well as our classic  ultra  ultimate and slippers collections 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that ugg brand sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from ugg brand products will not at some point decline 
for the year ended december   the ugg brand s wholesale net sales increased  and the ugg brand s net sales including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales increased by approximately  compared to the same period in we do not expect these growth rates to continue 
simple overview the simple brand began in as an alternative to all the over built  over priced  and over hyped products in the marketplace 
the brand s foundation was built on the old school sneaker and the new original clog 
in  as a response to the massive amount of waste produced by the footwear industry  the simple brand launched a new collection of ecologically friendly footwear called green toe  a product collection that consists primarily of sustainable materials and that is revolutionizing the footwear industry 
we have repositioned the brand to be focused on becoming a leader in sustainable footwear and accessories 
in  we improved our distribution initiatives through the establishment of dedicated sales representatives in key markets 
in and  our men s and women s products performed well at retail  as demand continued to increase for our green toe and ecosneaks products 
we increased our account base both domestically and internationally 
we also expanded our presence into additional retail stores with our key accounts 
for the year ended december   wholesale net sales of simple products increased by approximately  and net sales of simple products including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales increased by approximately  compared to the same period in we expect simple brand growth including wholesale  ecommerce and retail store sales  to be higher year over year in compared to ecommerce overview we acquired our ecommerce retailing business in november as part of the acquisition of the teva rights 
our ecommerce business  which sells all three of our brands  enables us to meet the growing demand for these products  to sell the products at retail prices and to provide us with significant incremental operating income 
from the time we initiated our ecommerce business through the end of  we have had significant revenue growth  much of which occurred as the ugg brand gained popularity and as consumers have continued to increase reliance on the internet for footwear and other purchases 
net sales of the ecommerce business increased in the year ended december   compared to the same period in as our annual baseline of ecommerce sales increases  we do not expect this growth rate to continue 
our ecommerce business consists of internet sales and catalog sales 
managing our internet business requires us to focus on generating internet traffic to our websites  to effectively convert website visits into orders  and to maximize average order sizes 
we distribute approximately  consumer brochures for our ugg brand products throughout the year to drive our catalog order business 
we plan to continue to grow our internet business through improved website features and performance  increased marketing and international websites 
overall  our ecommerce business benefits from the strength of our brands and  as we grow our brands over time  we expect this business to continue to be an important segment of our business 
retail stores overview in we opened our fifth retail outlet store  in woodbury  new york  to add to our existing retail outlet stores in ventura  california  camarillo  california  wrentham  massachusetts and riverhead  new york 
in  we also opened our second ugg brand concept store in chicago  illinois  to add to our existing concept store in new york  new york 
based on the success of the existing stores  we currently plan to open one additional outlet store and two additional ugg brand concept stores in major metropolitan areas by the end of our retail stores enable us to directly impact our customers experience  meet the growing demand for these products  to sell the products at retail prices and to provide us with incremental operating income 
from the time we opened our first retail store through the end of  we have had significant revenue growth  much of which occurred as we opened new stores and the ugg brand gained popularity 
net sales of the retail store business increased in the year ended december   compared to the same period in we do not expect this growth rate to continue because as we increase the number of our stores  each new store will have less proportional impact on our growth rate 
seasonality our business is seasonal  with the highest percentage of teva brand net sales occurring in the first and second quarters of each year and the highest percentage of ugg brand net sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
to date  the simple brand has not had a seasonal impact on the company 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales     income from operations     first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales     income from operations     included in income from operations in the fourth quarter of is a  impairment loss on our teva trademarks 
with the dramatic growth in the ugg brand in recent years  combined with the introduction of a fall teva product line  net sales in the last half of the year have exceeded that for the first half of the year 
given our expectations for each of our brands in  we currently expect this trend to continue 
nonetheless  actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition and our customers continuing to carry and promote our various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties

the increase in income from operations was primarily due to higher sales and gross profit compared to  and also due to a  impairment loss on our teva trademarks in net sales

gross profit 
gross profit increased by  or  in compared to as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was in both and our gross margins fluctuate based on several factors and we expect our gross margin to decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased by  or  in compared to as a percentage of net sales  sg a decreased from in to in the increase in sg a in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in payroll  commissions  retail store and ecommerce expenses and warehouse expenses  as well as approximately  of expenses in related to the investigation and restatement of certain of our historical consolidated financial statements as disclosed in the company s annual report on form k a for the year ended december  impairment loss 
we conducted our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques as of december  and  and concluded that as of december   we had no impairment loss since the fair values of our goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets were higher than the carrying amounts 
however  as of december   the fair value of our teva brand trademarks was lower than the carrying amount  therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  on our teva trademarks in the fourth quarter of income from operations 
income from operations increased by  or  in compared to  representing of sales in and in the increase in income from operations was primarily due to the increase in sales and gross profit in  and also due to the impairment loss in income from operations of the teva brand at wholesale increased by  or  in compared to this increase was largely due to the  impairment loss on our teva trademarks in as well as the increase in net sales in  partially offset by higher divisional sales expenses and design expenses in income from operations of the ugg brand at wholesale increased by  or  in compared to this was largely due to increased sales volumes and was partially offset by higher sales commissions and marketing expenses due to the growth of the brand

income from operations of our retail store business increased by  or  in compared to this increase was largely due to the increase in net sales  partially offset by higher operating costs 
because this business is in its early stages and we have begun adding new stores each year  our growth rate has increased significantly since inception 
we do not expect this growth rate to continue 
unallocated overhead costs increased by  or  in compared to the increase resulted primarily from higher corporate payroll costs  warehouse expenses  and international division costs  none of which are allocated to the brands 
other expense income 
other expense income  net was  in compared to  in in  we had higher interest income from higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances and higher investment return rates than in addition  we had and of interest and penalties in and  respectively  related to underreporting of employee payroll expense and underpayment of certain tax obligations to authorities in china for one of the company s foreign subsidiaries  holbrook limited 
during  we accrued of interest and penalties related to this matter  however  in the fourth quarter of  we reversed of penalties from and prior years that had previously been accrued  because authorities in china did not assess the related estimated penalties when a portion of the tax obligations were paid 
we expect to continue to have increased interest income in based on higher expected cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in compared to income taxes 
in  income tax expense was  representing an effective income tax rate of 
in  income tax expense was  representing an effective income tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to approximately  of impairment loss in attributable to a foreign subsidiary that receives no tax benefit from the charge  as this subsidiary is in a tax free jurisdiction

our net income increased  or  primarily as a result of higher net sales  higher gross profit  and higher interest income in  and also from the impairment loss in our earnings per diluted share increased from in to in primarily as a result of the increase in net income 
we do not expect these growth rates to continue

in  we had net sales of  and income from operations of  compared to net sales of  and income from operations of  in these results were driven by increased ugg and simple brand sales  partially offset by a decrease in teva brand sales 
the decrease in income from operations was the result of a  impairment loss on our teva trademarks in  partially offset by higher sales and gross margins compared to net sales 
net sales increased by  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to increases in sales for the ugg and simple brand sales  partially offset by lower teva brand sales  as discussed below

in addition  full price sales of ugg brand products increased in compared to net wholesale sales of teva products decreased by  or  in compared to this decrease was due to increased competition  a lack of meaningful product innovation  and a decline in sales in certain international markets 
we began to address the situation by dedicating significantly greater resources to product development  marketing and advertising  and the development of a solid international infrastructure 
we began to see the results of these efforts in the fourth quarter of with an increase of over the fourth quarter of net wholesale sales of ugg brand products increased by  or  in compared to due primarily to increased sales of all categories  including boots  slippers  casuals  kids and men s footwear

impairment loss 
we conducted our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques as of december  and concluded that the fair value of our teva brand trademarks was lower than the carrying amount 
therefore  we recognized an impairment loss of  on our teva trademarks in the fourth quarter of income from operations 
income from operations decreased by  or  in compared to  representing of sales in and in the decrease in income from operations was primarily due to the impairment loss and the increase in sg a expenses  partially offset by the increase in sales and gross profit

the increase in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to approximately  of impairment loss attributable to a foreign subsidiary that receives no tax benefit from the charge  as this subsidiary is in a tax free jurisdiction

off balance sheet arrangements we have four types of off balance sheet arrangements 
see contractual obligations below 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital and operating needs using a combination of our cash and cash equivalents balances  short term investments  cash generated from operations and as needed  the credit availability under our revolving credit facility 
in an economic recession or under other adverse economic conditions  we may be unable to realize a return on our cash equivalents and short term investments or to secure additional credit on favorable terms 
such failures may impact our working capital reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have not experienced any failed auctions or similar sale failures of our short term investments held at december  subsequent to december   we sold a majority of our variable rate demand notes  auction rate securities and dividend received deduction securities at full par value 
see part i  item a  risk factors for more discussion of this issue 
during the latter part of  us and foreign credit markets experienced adverse conditions  including unusual volatility and a lack of secondary market liquidity  which conditions have presented  and continue to present  significant challenges to the investment markets and have limited the availability of short term debt for working capital 
while it is difficult to predict how long these adverse conditions will exist  these factors  if continuing  could adversely impact our future financial condition and our future results of operations 
the seasonality of our business requires us to build inventory levels in anticipation of the sales for the coming season 
the teva brand generally begins to build inventory levels beginning in the fourth quarter and first quarter in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the first and second quarters  whereas the ugg brand generally builds its inventories in the second and third quarters to support sales for the fall and winter selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of these inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables 
given the seasonality of our teva and ugg brands  our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations is generally provided using our internal cash flows 
if necessary  we may borrow funds under our revolving credit facility 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was largely due to the higher net income 
the increase was also due to a greater increase in income taxes payable in compared to due to the higher pre tax income as well as a greater increase in trade accounts payable in versus primarily due to increased purchases of inventory 
this was partially offset by a greater increase in inventories in compared to due to the planned early receipt of spring product in the fourth quarter of to support the higher expected sales in the first quarter of compared to  as well as a greater increase in accounts receivable in compared to  which resulted primarily from increased sales 
net working capital improved by  to  as of december  from  as of december   primarily as a result of higher short term investments balances  increased accounts receivable and increased cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable and an increase in income taxes payable 
these changes in working capital are primarily due to increased sales as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments 
cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  in  which was comprised primarily of the net purchases of short term investments 
in addition  we used  for capital expenditures  primarily related to the build out of our new retail stores  the replacement and upgrading of certain computer equipment and additional warehouse equipment

in addition  we used  for capital expenditures  primarily related to the build out of three retail stores  racking for the distribution center in camarillo  california and the replacement and upgrading of certain computer equipment

trade accounts receivable increased by to  at december  from  at december  resulting primarily from a increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of accounts receivable turnover increased to times in the twelve months ended december  from times in the twelve months ended december   primarily as a result of increased sales and faster collections in compared to due to the continued increased demand for ugg brand product in  which encouraged retailers to pay their receivables balances faster in efforts to receive their upcoming deliveries more quickly 
inventories increased by  or  at december  compared to december   reflecting a  increase in ugg brand inventory  a  increase in teva brand inventory and a  increase in simple brand inventory 
overall  inventory turnover increased to times for the year ended december  from times for the year ended december   largely due to higher sales during the twelve months ended december  compared to net sales in the twelve months ended december  the increase in inventory of all brands was due to the planned early delivery of spring product in the fourth quarter of to support the higher expected sales in the first quarter of compared to our revolving credit facility with comerica bank the facility provides for a maximum availability of  up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december  or  at our option  at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  at december  plus to  depending on our ratio of liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility includes annual commitment fees of per year and expires on june  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility  no foreign currency reserves for outstanding forward contracts and aggregate outstanding letters of credit of as a result   was available under the facility at december  the agreements underlying the facility contain certain financial covenants including a quick ratio requirement  profitability requirements and a tangible net worth requirement  among others  as well as a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december   and remain so as of the date of this report 
as of december   we had no material commitments for future capital expenditures  but we estimate that the capital expenditures for will range from approximately  to  and anticipate those will include the costs of an inventory pick module in our warehouse in camarillo  california  and the build out of new retail stores 
the actual amount of capital expenditures for may differ from this estimate  largely depending on any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets and the timing of expenditures 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations     unrecognized tax benefits   total      our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our corporate offices  distribution centers and retail locations 
our purchase obligations consist primarily of approximately  in outstanding purchase orders with our manufacturers that we anticipate will become due in less than one year 
also  we have approximately  of promotional expenditures due periodically through the unrecognized tax benefits are related to uncertain tax positions that have been or will be taken in our income tax returns that would impact the effective tax rate  if recognized 
we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing facility  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories  the availability of short term credit  market volatility and the volume of letters of credit used to purchase product  among others 
see part i  item a  risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirement  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit facility or draw on our existing facility 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may  from time to time  evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands

impact of inflation we believe that the rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts  markdowns  and bad debts are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales  while the related costs paid to third party shipping companies are recorded as a cost of sales 
we present revenue net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience  existing  known circumstances  authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been materially accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience with bad debts 
reserves have been established for all probable losses of this nature 
the gross trade accounts receivable balance was  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was at december   compared to gross trade accounts receivable of  and allowance for doubtful accounts of at december  the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  compared to december  was primarily related to the collection of accounts for which we had previously reserved as doubtful as well as the write offs of accounts deemed to be uncollectable 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by approximately reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we estimate the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable  and we record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
the reserve for sales discounts was approximately  at december  and  at december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in gross trade accounts receivable as of december  compared to december  in addition to a larger volume of pre season sales to customers in the fourth quarter of our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example a change in the estimate of the percentage of accounts that will ultimately take their discount would change the reserve for sales discounts at december  by approximately allowance for estimated returns 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products but discourage returns for other reasons 
we base the amount of the allowance on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for returns was  at december  and  at december  the increase in the allowance was primarily the result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  as well as a change in the assumptions used to calculate the allowance as of december  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the reserve for returns at december  by approximately allowance for estimated markdowns 
when our customers pay their invoices  they often take deductions for markdowns against their invoices  which we seldom recover 
therefore  we record an allowance for the balance of markdowns that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each quarter  along with an estimated reserve for markdowns that have not yet been taken against outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing of markdowns taken against invoices 
the allowance for markdowns was  at december  and  at december  the decrease in the allowance was a result of faster resolution of these markdowns by our vendor compliance department 
inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or estimated future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the decrease in inventory write downs at december  compared to december  was primarily due to smaller amounts of closeout inventory on hand for teva and simple 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down reserve at december  by approximately valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets individually 
we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based on the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill or the fair value of the assets for nonamortizable intangibles compared to their respective carrying value 
we consider other long lived assets to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  we consider the following factors the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  our future plans regarding utilization of the assets  any changes in legal ownership of rights to the assets  and changes in consumer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets 
if we determine the assets to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate sales or otherwise be used by us 
in and  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets using market value approaches and valuation techniques and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  and  or of the teva trademarks as of december  however  as of december   we concluded that the fair value of our trademarks was less than the carrying amount  and accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of  in the fourth quarter of our use of different estimates including estimated royalty rates  discount rates  and future revenues and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated future revenue growth rate for teva would have resulted in the carrying value exceeding the fair value as of december  accordingly  if growth rates fail to meet our forecasts  impairment of the teva trademark may occur in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas standardizes the definition and approaches for fair value measurements of financial instruments for those standards which already permit or require the use of fair value 
it does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas defines a hierarchy for valuation techniques and also requires additional disclosures 
the provisions of sfas are effective for us as of january  the fasb has deferred the effective date of sfas only as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides companies the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this provides companies the opportunity to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by measuring instruments differently without complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the effect this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
the objective of the statement is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
sfas r requires that all business combinations be accounted for by applying the acquisition method previously referred to as the purchase method  and most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in business combinations to be recorded at full fair value 
sfas r also broadens the definition of a business and changes the treatment of direct acquisition related costs from being included in the purchase price to instead being generally expensed if they are not costs associated with issuing debt or equity securities 
sfas r is effective for us beginning january   and will be applied prospectively to any new business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
the objective of the statement is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas specifies that noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests be reported as a separate component of equity  not as a liability or other item outside of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
sfas is effective for us beginning january   and will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before that date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
although we have used foreign currency hedges in the past  we currently do not utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate  as the majority of our purchases and sales for the foreseeable future will be denominated in us currency 
although our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us currency  our sales and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold and manufactured 
if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our distributors  which may have a negative impact on our net sales and gross margins 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any impact on sales and gross margins attributed to pricing pressures caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
market risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our revolving line of credit provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or at our election tied to libor 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have no impact on income before income taxes
