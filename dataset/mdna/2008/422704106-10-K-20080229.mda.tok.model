item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a for further discussion 
employees at our la camorra unit went on an additional strike for days  which ended in december many of our employees are represented by unions 
we anticipate that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with each union  although there can be no assurance that this can be done or that it can be done without disruptions to production 
during and  labor strikes and work slow downs adversely affected our production in mexico and venezuela  and our venezuelan operations were also impacted by labor issues in and similar labor problems could continue to affect our financial results or condition in the future

item a 
risk factors the following risks and uncertainties  together with the other information set forth in this form k  should be carefully considered by those who invest in our securities 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results and could decrease the value of our common and or preferred stock 

table of contents financial risks we have had losses in the past that may occur in the future 
although we reported net income for the years ended december  and  of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million 
a comparison of operating results over the past three years can be found in results of operations in md a 
many of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control  including the volatility of metals prices  interest rates  global or regional political or economic policies  inflation  developments and crises  governmental regulations  continuity of orebodies  and speculation and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors 
we cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience net losses in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  including speculative activities  relative exchange rates of the us dollar  global and regional demand and production  recession or reduced economic activity  and other political and economic conditions 
these factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration  development or operations  or incur asset write downs at one or more of our properties 
in february  we announced an agreement to acquire of the greens creek mine  where we currently own the remaining interest see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have received million in committed debt financing  which will be used towards funding the acquisition 
if the market prices for the metals we produce fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  our ability to service our debt obligations associated with this transaction may be adversely affected

hedging activities could limit our opportunities if prices rise 
we periodically enter into hedging activities  such as forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option contracts  to manage the metals prices received on our products and in an attempt to insulate our operating results from declines in those prices 
however  hedging may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract 
in addition  we may experience losses if a 
table of contents counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity 
we had no open hedging positions at december  our costs are subject to currency fluctuations 
our products are sold in world markets in united states dollars  although a portion of our venezuelan operating expenses are incurred in the venezuelan bol var 
foreign exchange fluctuations may materially increase our production costs  future exploration activities and costs of capital 
for more specific information with regard to foreign currency as it relates to our operations in venezuela  see la camorra segment in md a 
our profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities 
our business activities are highly dependent on the costs of commodities such as fuel  steel and cement 
the recent prices for such commodities have significantly increased and have increased our costs of production and development 
a material increase in costs at any of our operating properties could have a significant effect on our profitability 
for additional discussion  see results of operations in md a 
failure to comply with debt covenants could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
in september  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement that includes various covenants and other limitations related to our indebtedness and investments that require us to maintain customary measures of financial performance 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the credit agreement and were in compliance with our covenants 
we believe we will be able to comply with such requirements in the future  although failure to do so could adversely affect our results or financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing 
in february  we received million in committed debt financing for possible use towards our announced acquisition of the remaining of the greens creek mine see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the greens creek transaction 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations  future metals prices  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments  including long lived assets and investments  reserves for contingencies and litigation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information  see critical accounting estimates in md a  note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated  our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise and our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income we recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets 
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction 
to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates  our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted 
additionally  future changes in tax law could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets 
as of december   our current and non current deferred tax asset balances were million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets 

table of contents operation  development  exploration and acquisition risks our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks 
we currently conduct significant mining operations and exploration projects in venezuela and mexico 
we anticipate that we will continue to conduct significant operations in these and possibly other international locations in the future 
because we conduct operations internationally  we are subject to political and economic risks such as the effects of local political  labor and economic developments and unrest  significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate  exchange controls and export or sale restrictions  expropriation or nationalization of assets with inadequate compensation  currency fluctuations and repatriation restrictions  invalidation of governmental orders  permits  or agreements  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits and contracts  recurring tax audits and delays in processing tax credits or refunds  corruption  demands for improper payments  expropriation  and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security  disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to us laws and regulations  fuel or other commodity shortages  illegal mining  laws or policies of foreign countries and the united states affecting trade  investment and taxation  civil disturbances  war and terrorist actions  and seizures of assets 
consequently  our exploration  development and production activities outside of the united states may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
for more information regarding our operations in mexico and venezuela  see md a  item property descriptions and other various risk factors relating to our foreign operations 
political  social and regulatory change in venezuela may adversely affect us 
the success of our la camorra unit is dependent on the political  social and regulatory stability of venezuela 
we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully 
however  we face continued uncertainty in venezuela relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  exportation and exchange controls  and the possible effects of all of these uncertainties on our operations 
risks due to changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages  industry nationalization  seizures of assets  relationships with small mining groups in the vicinity of our mining operations and the impact on commodities necessary to operate  mean there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
any such factors or occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
specifically  we are currently subject to the following business risks in venezuela  which are discussed in more detail in md a in january  the venezuelan government announced its intentions to nationalize certain strategic sectors  including petroleum and communications  now owned by private entities 
there has been no announced determination that the mining industry in venezuela will be considered for nationalization  however  there can be no assurance that our operations in venezuela will not be affected by the actions of the government in this capacity 
a fixed exchange rate of venezuelan currency with the us dollar  which has impacted our costs and operating cash flows 
a recently enacted criminal exchange law imposes strict sanctions  both criminal and economic  for currency exchanges outside the officially designated methods or for obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses 
effective january   we implemented a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bol var  the local currency in venezuela 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

table of contents the venezuelan government announced its intention to rescind inactive  non compliant mining concessions and created a state agency that is responsible for exploration  exploitation  processing and industrialization of gold and other minerals in venezuela 
in october  the company s subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv  received notice from the venezuelan ministry for basic industries and mining mibam that it would commence administrative proceedings that it said could lead to the revocation of mhv s la camorra concession notice 
the notice said it was based upon the alleged exhaustion of the gold reserves at the la camorra concession and upon the alleged non payment of an extraction tax 
hecla has ongoing mining operations at mina isidora that process ore at the la camorra mill and has had  and plans to continue to have  independent contractors that extract ore from the la camorra concession on the company s behalf 
the company and mhv disagree with the assertions in the notice 
we have filed a formal disagreement with mibam  and have not received a response 
we plan to contest the notice vigorously and  based upon what we know at present  believe that we have strong legal grounds in our favor 
however  there can be no assurance that our operations in venezuela will not be affected by the government s proceedings addressed in the notice 
venezuela has had high levels of inflation in the recent past 
continued or increased inflation there could increase the prices we pay for products and services  including wages for our employees 
movement of cash from venezuela  at the official exchange rate  is regulated by the criminal exchange act 
we are able to repatriate cash to the us  however  in doing so we must utilize specific government programs that have been limited or slow  or utilize negotiable instruments on which we have incurred losses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated 
capitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate 
if we are unable to realize a return on these investments  we may incur a related asset write down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
our ability to sustain or increase our current level of production of metals partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and or expand existing mining operations 
before we can begin a development project  we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so 
this determination is based on estimates of several factors  including ore reserves  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  future metals prices  facility and equipment costs  availability of affordable sources of power and adequacy of water supply  exploration and drilling success  capital and operating costs of a development project  environmental considerations and permitting  adequate access to the site  including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  currency exchange and repatriation risks  applicable tax rates  foreign currency fluctuation and inflation rates  political risks and regulatory climate in the foreign countries in which we operate  and availability of financing 
these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data  which may be imprecise 
as a result  actual operating and capital costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates as a result of which it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project 
our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise 
our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals 
you are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves 
reserves are estimates made by our professional technical personnel  and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions 
our reserve estimates  particularly those for properties that have not yet started producing  may change based on actual production experience 
further  reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices  which may not be consistent among our operating and non operating properties 
the economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of the various metals we mine  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  increase in the dilution of the ore  and reduced recovery rates 
short term operating factors relating to our ore reserves  such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may adversely affect our cash flow 
we may use forward sales contracts and other hedging techniques to partially offset the effects of a drop in the market prices of the metals we mine 
however  if the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period  we could experience delays in new project development  net losses  reduced cash flow  reductions in reserves  and write downs of asset values 
efforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful  which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock 
one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
thus  we must continually replace depleted ore reserves 
our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration program 
mineral exploration  particularly for silver and gold  is highly speculative and expensive 
it involves many risks and is often nonproductive 
even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit  it may be several years before production is possible 
during that time  it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic  regulatory  political or other reasons 
as a result of high costs and other uncertainties  we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted  which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
our joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful 
it is possible we will enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties  similar to our joint venture arrangements related to the greens creek unit 
in a typical joint venture arrangement  the partners own a proportionate share of the assets  are entitled to indemnification from each other and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to their interest in the joint venture 
if a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement  we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro rata share of the joint venture 
for further information  please see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on february   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary  rio grande silver inc  acquired the right to earn into a joint venture interest in an approximately square mile consolidated land package in the creede mining district of colorado 
for more information on the terms of the agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy 
mines have limited lives  which is an inherent risk in acquiring mining properties 
we are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties 
although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our investors  these pursuits are costly and often unproductive 
inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 

table of contents there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the united states and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and or production activities  and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks 
in addition to the risk associated with limited mine lives  we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices  failure to obtain permits  labor problems  changes in regulatory environment  an inability to obtain financing and other factors previously described 
acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic  political  operating  and geological risks 
in addition  we face strong competition for companies and properties from other mining companies  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  and we may be unable to acquire attractive companies and mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable 
we may be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties if our announced acquisition agreements fail to close 
in february  we announced two separate acquisition agreements an agreement with kennecott minerals to acquire the companies that hold of the greens creek mines  and and agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of independence lead mines company independence 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
failure to complete these transactions could negatively impact our stock performance and future operations 
for example the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the transactions will be completed 
we must pay expenses related to the transactions  including a nonrefundable deposit and substantial legal and accounting fees  even if the transactions are not completed 
this could affect the results of our operations for the period during which the fees are incurred 
in the case of the greens creek transaction  current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us and kennecott  until our strategies are announced and executed 
this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel 
our business depends on good relations with our employees 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers  managers  employees and other personnel  including those residing outside of the us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of such employees 
we compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry in connection with the recruiting and retention of qualified employees knowledgeable in mining operations 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
during  we significantly reduced the workforce at the la camorra mine and mill through voluntary termination incentives  at a cost of approximately million 
our ability to manage our costs at our la camorra unit in venezuela depends in part upon the success of our efforts to retain a remaining workforce that will maintain a satisfactory level of production and cost performance 
mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production 
production may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents  unfavorable ground conditions  work stoppages or slow downs  lower than expected ore grades  the metallurgical characteristics of the ore are less economical than anticipated  or our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected 
our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards  political and country risks  civil unrest or terrorism  industrial accidents  labor disputes or strikes  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  cave ins  explosive rock failures  and 
table of contents unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
such risks could result in personal injury or fatalities  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities  environmental damage  delays in exploration  development or mining  monetary losses  and legal liability 
for some risks  we maintain insurance to protect against losses at levels consistent with our historical experience  industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  too expensive for us  and  therefore  we do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability 
legal  market and regulatory risks we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
there are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved 
if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us  is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise impacts our operations  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we may ultimately incur environmental remediation costs substantially in excess of the amounts we have accrued and the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings may be awarded substantial damages  which costs and damages we may not be able to recover from our insurers 
for a description of the lawsuits in which we are involved  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental and lessor approvals and permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex  time consuming and costly process 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control 
obtaining environmental permits  including the approval of reclamation plans  may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and  if obtained  that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation 
we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
our business is subject to extensive us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing development  production  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  use of toxic substances  environmental regulations  mine safety and other matters 
see risks titled our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made and our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks 
we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage or violating environmental laws  and we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future 
new legislation and regulations may be adopted at any time that result in additional operating expense  capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining  production or development of our properties 
from time to time  the us congress considers proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
the extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of us congressional action is difficult to predict 
although a majority of our existing us mining operations occur on private or patented property  changes to the general mining law  if adopted  could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands 
see also our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks and political  social and regulatory instability in venezuela may affect us  and md a 

table of contents our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are subject to significant environmental obligations  particularly in northern idaho 
at december   we had accrued million as a provision for environmental remediation  million of which relates to our various liabilities in idaho  and there is a significant risk that the costs of remediation could materially exceed this provision 
for an overview of our potential environmental liabilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged 
unpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings  the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested 
although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings  title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title 
in accordance with mining industry practice  we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property 
therefore  while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties  some titles may be defective 
the price of our common stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future 
our common and preferred stocks are listed on the new york stock exchange 
the market price for our common shares has been volatile  often based on fluctuating proven and probable reserves  factors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects  such as global economic developments and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries  changes in metals prices  particularly gold and silver  our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the sec  foreign political and regulatory risk  the success of our exploration program  ability to meet production estimates  environmental and legal risk  the extent of analytical coverage concerning our business  and the trading volume and general market interest in our securities 
the market price of our common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long term value  and may prevent shareholders from realizing a profit on their investment 
our series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
our series b preferred stock ranks on parity with our mandatory convertible preferred stock 
our mandatory convertible preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million which includes any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
our mandatory convertible preferred stock ranks on parity with our series b preferred stock 
we may not be able to pay preferred stock dividends in the future 
in july  we paid outstanding dividends in arrears on our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock totaling approximately million 
since july  we have continued to pay regular quarterly dividends on our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the annual dividend payable on the series b preferred stock is currently million 
the expected dividend payable on our mandatory convertible preferred stock will be million in april  and then million quarterly thereafter 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not declared preferred dividends on series b preferred stock since the second quarter of there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share 

table of contents we may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes 
any such acquisition could be material to us and could significantly increase the size and scope of our business  including our market capitalization 
to the extent we issue substantial additional equity securities  the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue up to million in common stock and warrants in connection with business combination transactions 
if a large number of shares of our common stock is sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future issuances by us of our common stock or other equity will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  shares of our common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions 
we may issue substantial additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with material acquisition transactions 
the market price of our common stock could decline if certain large holders of our common stock  or recipients of our common stock in connection with an acquisition  sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner 
in addition  these sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that transaction would be beneficial to stockholders 
these impediments include the classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval  a provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors  a provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our entire board of directors  a prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders  a provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock  a provision that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders  a prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the interest  or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination  and a prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock 
the existence of these provisions may deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell our stock at a premium over prevailing prices 
the potential inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock

table of contents item property descriptions operating properties the lucky friday unit since  we have owned and operated the lucky friday unit  a deep underground silver  lead and zinc mine located in the coeur d alene mining district in northern idaho 
lucky friday is one quarter mile east of mullan  idaho  and is adjacent to us interstate below is a map illustrating the location and access to the lucky friday unit 
luckyfriday 
jpg 
there have been two ore bearing structures mined at the lucky friday unit 
the first  mined through  was the lucky friday vein  a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d alene mining district 
the orebody is located in the revett formation  which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of orebodies in the coeur d alene mining district 
the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet 
its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite 
the ore occurs as a single continuous orebody in and along the lucky friday vein 
the major part of the orebody has extended from the  foot level to and below the  foot level 
the second ore bearing structure  known as the lucky friday expansion area  has been mined since during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high grade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property  approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings 
this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the level 
we control the gold hunter property under a long term operating agreement with independence lead mines company independence expiring in february and renewable thereafter  that entitles us  as operator  to an interest in the net profits from operations from the gold hunter property 
under the current agreement  we would be obligated to pay a net profits interest of to independence after we have recouped our costs to explore and develop the property 
on february   we announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of independence  including the mining claims pertaining to their agreement with the lucky friday mine that includes all future interest or royalty obligation to independence see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as of december   unrecouped costs totaled approximately million 
we believe all of our commitments under the operating agreement have been met 
for a description of a legal claim involving the lucky friday unit and independence  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access  cut and fill 
this method utilizes rubber tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the orebody 
once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein  it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed  either above or below  from the ramp system 
the ore produced from lucky friday is processed in a  ton per day conventional flotation mill 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately tons per day 
the flotation process produces both a silver lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  lead and zinc 
all silver lead and zinc concentrate production during was shipped to teck cominco limited s smelter in trail  british columbia  canada

cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent measurements that are not in accordance with gaap that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver provide an indicator of profitability and efficiency at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in item md a  under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by ore body and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at the lucky friday  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade at the lucky friday ranges from per ton nsr to per ton nsr 
an independent audit of reserves at the lucky friday was conducted by scott wilson roscoe postle associates inc during our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices 
table of contents december  silver lead zinc reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
zinc recovery has improved from historical levels due to mill upgrades completed during  and the changes in reserves in versus  and in versus  are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work together with increases in forecast metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
a pre feasibility study is under way to determine whether it is possible to expand production from the lucky friday mine 
the study is scheduled for completion in the third quarter of in addition  we are examining construction of an internal shaft  which  upon completion  would allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings on the level  down to the level  and also provide deeper exploration access 
basic engineering and equipment procurement documents have been completed  and activities in are anticipated to include detailed engineering  major equipment purchases  including a production hoist and sinker hoist  pre development from existing workings to the collar  including the hoist room and associated excavations  installation of shaft collar and head frame  and related development on the level 
ultimate reclamation activities are anticipated to include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed in  and at december   an asset retirement obligation of approximately million had been recorded for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to  and all are in good physical condition 
in  and  we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries 
additions included a three stage crushing system  increased flotation capacity and two new flash cells  new column cells and tailings thickeners  and an on stream analyzer 
the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside contractors as required 
at december   there were employees at the lucky friday unit 
the united steelworkers of america is the bargaining agent for the lucky friday s hourly employees 
the current labor agreement expires on may  avista corporation supplies electrical power to the lucky friday unit 
the greens creek unit we currently hold a interest in the greens creek unit through a joint venture arrangement with kennecott greens creek mining company and kennecott juneau mining company  subsidiaries of rio tinto 
the term of the joint venture arrangement continues for years after the effective date may  and for so long thereafter as products are produced from the properties or the participants continue to have an ownership interest in the assets  unless the arrangement is terminated earlier or is extended 
the partners of the joint venture arrangement are obligated to contribute funds to adopted programs in proportion to their respective participating interests 
a participant s interest in the joint venture arrangement would change upon election to contribute less to an adopted budget than the percentage reflected by its participating interest  in the event of a participant s default in making its agreed upon contribution to an adopted budget  followed by the election of the other participant to invoke remedies as permitted in the agreement  transfer by a participant of less than all of its participating interest in accordance with the terms of the agreement  or acquisition by a participant of some or all of the other participant s interest  however arising 
on february   we announced an agreement to acquire all of the shares of the rio tinto subsidiaries that hold the remaining interest in the greens creek mine  which will result in various subsidiaries of ours holding ownership of the greens creek joint venture 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as a part of the agreement  no distributions are allowed to the venture partners from the date of the stock purchase agreement  resulting in the allocation of all cash flows  assets and liabilities  prior to the close of the transaction  to our account after netting out our interest rate factor  if any 
the greens creek orebody contains silver  zinc  gold and lead  and lies adjacent to the admiralty island national monument  an environmentally sensitive area 
the greens creek property includes patented lode claims and one patented mill site claim  in addition to property leased from the us forest service 
greens creek also has title to mineral rights on  acres of federal land adjacent to the properties 
the entire project is accessed by boat and served by miles of road and consists of the mine  an ore concentrating mill  a tailings impoundment area  a ship loading facility  camp facilities and a ferry dock

the greens creek deposit is a polymetallic  stratiform  massive sulfide deposit 
the host rock consists of predominantly marine sedimentary  and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks  which have been subjected to multiple periods of deformation 
these deformational episodes have imposed intense tectonic fabrics on the rocks 
mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites and a structural footwall of graphitic and calcareous argillite 
major sulfide minerals are pyrite  sphalerite  galena  and tetrahedrite tennanite 
pursuant to a land exchange agreement  the joint venture transferred private property equal to a value of million to the us forest service and received exploration and mining rights to approximately  acres of land with mining potential surrounding the existing mine 
production from new ore discoveries on the exchanged lands will be subject to federal royalties included in the land exchange agreement 
the royalty is only due on production from reserves that are not part of greens creek s extralateral rights 
thus far  there has been no discovery triggering payment of the royalty 
the royalty is if the average value of the ore during a year is greater than per ton of ore  and if the value is per ton or less 
the benchmark of per ton is adjusted annually according to the gross domestic product gdp implicit price deflator until the year  and at december   was at approximately per ton when applying the latest gdp implicit price deflator observation 
greens creek is an underground mine which produces approximately  tons of ore per day 
the primary mining methods are cut and fill and longhole stoping 
the ore is processed on site at a mill  which produces lead  zinc and bulk concentrates  as well as dor containing silver and gold 
the dor is sold to a precious metal refiner and the three concentrate products are sold to a number of major smelters worldwide 
concentrates are shipped from a marine terminal located on admiralty island about nine miles from the mine site 
the greens creek unit has historically been powered completely by diesel generators located on site 
however  an agreement was reached during to purchase excess hydroelectric power from the local power company 
installation of the necessary infrastructure was completed in  and use of hydroelectric power commenced during the third quarter of low lake levels and increased demand in the juneau area have combined to decrease power available to greens creek  and it is unlikely that greens creek will obtain sufficient utility power until the employees at greens creek are employees of kennecott greens creek mining company  and are not represented by a bargaining agent 
there were employees at the greens creek unit at december  our interest in the net book value of the greens creek unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million 
all equipment  infrastructure and facilities  including camp and concentrate storage facilities  are in good condition 
as of december   we have accrued million for reclamation and closure costs 
a reclamation trust fund has been established and funded for million  our portion of which being approximately million 
this fund replaced other forms of security that had been provided to regulatory agencies 
kennecott greens creek mining company s geology and engineering staff computes the estimated ore reserves  and provides the weighted average metals prices used in the reserve estimates  for the greens creek unit  with technical support from rio tinto plc 
we review geologic interpretation and reserve methodology  but the reserve compilation is not independently confirmed by us in its entirety

estimates of proven and probable ore reserves for the greens creek unit as of december  and are derived from successive generations of reserve and feasibility analyses for different areas of the mine each using a separate assessment of metals prices 
the weighted average prices used were determined by the kennecott greens creek mining company  and differ from the prices used by us  for example  in making such calculations for our lucky friday unit 
the average prices used for the greens creek unit were december  silver gold lead zinc ore reserves represent in place material  diluted and adjusted for expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries of ore reserve grades differ by ore zones and are expected to average for silver  for gold  for zinc and for lead 
the changes in reserves in versus and versus are due to addition of new drill data  increases in forecasted precious metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates for certain orebodies  partially offset by depletion due to production 
we only report probable reserves at the greens creek unit  which are based on average drill spacing of to feet 
proven reserves typically require that mining samples are partly the basis of the ore grade estimates used  while probable reserve grade estimates can be based entirely on drilling results 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by orebody and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
cutoff grades range from per ton net smelter return to per ton net smelter return 
an independent review by amec e c  inc was completed for reserve models in for the south  and southwest bench deposits

the mill uses a conventional carbon in leach process 
the ore is crushed with a three stage system consisting of a primary jaw crusher with secondary and tertiary cone crusher with a triple deck vibrating screen 
the grinding circuit includes a primary and a secondary ball mill 
the ground ore is mixed with a cyanide solution and clarified  followed by countercurrent carbon in leach gold adsorption 
the carbon is then stripped and the gold recovered and poured into gold bars for shipment to a third party refiner 
mill recovery averages approximately all mill equipment  infrastructure and facilities are in good condition 
the mill was constructed in and has been periodically upgraded 
the mill is capable of processing approximately tons per day 
during  we started a custom milling program for small mining cooperatives working in the area of la camorra and mina isidora mines 
the cooperatives sell their ore to us for further processing at our la camorra mill 
we also process gold bearing sands purchased from local suppliers

the venezuelan criminal exchange law imposes strict criminal and economic sanctions on the exchange of venezuelan currency with other foreign currency through other than officially designated methods  or for obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses 
approvals for foreign currency exchange are limited and we are evaluating opportunities to minimize our exposure to devaluation 
as a consequence  our cash balances denominated in bol vares that are maintained in venezuela have increased from a us dollar equivalent of approximately million at december   to million at december  additionally  during the next six months  we are required to convert into venezuelan currency the us dollar proceeds of venezuelan export sales made over the past days  or a total value of approximately million 
during and  we exchanged the us dollar equivalent of approximately million and million  respectively  valued at the official exchange rate of  bol vares to for approximately million and million  respectively  at open market exchange rates  in compliance with applicable regulations  incurring foreign exchange losses in each year for the differences 
approximately million and million of the and conversion losses were incurred on the repatriation of cash from venezuela  and are included in net foreign exchange loss on the consolidated statement of operations 
additional losses of approximately million and million for and are related to conversions of bol vares for the payment of expatriate payroll and other us dollar denominated goods and services  and are included in the cost of sales and other direct production costs and exploration amounts reported on the consolidated statement of operations 
although we are making appropriate applications through the venezuelan government for acquisition of dollars at the official exchange rate  our cash balances denominated in the venezuelan bol var may continue to grow and any future conversions or devaluation of the bol var may result in further losses when and if in the future we decide to distribute money outside venezuela 
changes to the venezuelan criminal exchange law enacted in december prohibit the publication of bol var exchange rates other than the official rate 
the central bank of venezuela maintains regulations concerning the export of gold from venezuela 
under current regulations  of our gold production from venezuela is required to be sold in venezuela 
prior to our acquisition of the la camorra mine  the then owners had sold substantially all of the gold production to the central bank of venezuela and built up a significant credit to cover the requirement  which we assumed upon our acquisition and have fully utilized 
during  we identified a local market with the ability to purchase the required of our production 
during and  we sold approximately and of our gold ounces  respectively  in venezuela 
effective january   we implemented a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bol var  the national currency in venezuela 
we believe that significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances affecting our venezuelan operations indicate that a change in the functional currency is appropriate  under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 foreign currency translation sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the balance sheet for our venezuelan operations was recalculated as of january   so that all assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate of  bol vares to  the fixed  official exchange rate 
we have used the official exchange rate pursuant to guidance from the american institute of certified public accountant s s international practices task force 
as a result  the dollar value of non monetary assets  previously translated at historical exchange rates  has been significantly reduced  with a translation adjustment recorded to equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the functional currency change resulted in a reduction of approximately million in the carrying value of net assets  with a translation adjustment for the same amount recorded to the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included as a component of shareholders equity on our balance sheet 
further discussion of the functional currency change  including a summary of how the functional currency indicators listed in sfas have been affected by recent changes in the economic facts and circumstances influencing our venezuelan operations  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential effects of factors such as currency exchange controls and export restrictions in venezuela  and the change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations to the bol var  are not included in cutoff grade calculations at the la camorra unit  which only consider estimated operating cost requirements 
however  the effects of these items are considered in calculating the total estimated cash flow and net present value of our venezuelan projects  measures used to determine whether overall project economics are positive 
by definition  reserves cannot be present at new projects unless they pass a positive economic test 
therefore  it is possible for a project to have sufficient ore grades to meet estimated operating cost requirements  but have negative overall economics  and not meet proven or probable reserve criteria  when considering the factors above 
the la camorra mine the la camorra mine is located approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz in the eastern venezuelan state of bol var 
the mine is accessed via a gravel road that we maintain and is six miles east of state highway  which is a paved two lane road running from upata south to the brazilian border 
we acquired the la camorra mine in from monarch resources investments limited monarch  and it is owned by us through our venezuelan subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv 
the purchase agreement includes a provision to pay monarch a net smelter return nsr royalty on production exceeding a cumulative total of  ounces of gold from the properties acquired in venezuela from monarch 
the royalty is based on a sliding scale that is dependent on the price of gold 
when the gold price is below per troy ounce  there is no royalty  when the price is between and per troy ounce the royalty is  when the price is between and per troy ounce  the royalty is  and when the price is and above  the royalty is 
the  ounce production milestone was reached during the second quarter of gold production since that time has been subject to the provisions of the royalty agreement  the payments of which have been offset by our costs incurred related to ongoing tax litigation  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the la camorra mine is located on an exploration concession granted by the ministry of energy and mines in that has been converted to a fifty year exploitation license 
the mine is a high grade underground gold mine that exploits two shear zone hosted quartz veins known as the main zone and the betzy vein 
it lies in the botanamo greenstone belt of the precambrian guayana shield and is hosted by the caballape group of volcanoclastic rocks 
the formations most likely date from archean to proterozoic in age and consist primarily of intermediate volcanics with subordinate metasediments 
gold mineralization at la camorra is confined to narrow  near vertical quartz veins hosted in an east west trending  left lateral shear zone 
most economic mineralization in the la camorra veins occur in distinct ore shoots 
gold occurs both as free particles in quartz and attached to  or included in  pyrite 
locally  gold is also seen on chloritic partings 
in  the principal working levels of the la camorra mine were located between the elevations of and feet below sea level 
the proven and probable reserves extended to the foot elevation  and exploration drill holes have intersected gold mineralization below the current reserve limits at the foot level 
at the end of  the mine had been developed to the foot level 
engineering studies undertaken in and indicated that the combination of ventilation and haulage requirements would make mining below the foot level extremely difficult and marginally economic without the development of a shaft 
in august  due to the long construction lead time necessary  the board of directors approved the development of a production shaft at the la camorra mine in order to develop further ore reserves and mine more efficiently at greater depths 
we began using the production shaft during the second half of the shaft loading station is at the foot level 
the underground workings at the la camorra mine are accessed via the shaft and a ramp from the surface  excavated at a grade  that provides access to numerous levels 
the main access ramp has been developed to a depth of approximately feet below sea level 

table of contents ore has been mined primarily by longhole stoping and extracted from the stopes using rubber tired equipment and hauled to the surface in mine haulage trucks and  beginning in the second half of  the production shaft 
sub economic material has been used to backfill mined out stopes 
site infrastructure  equipment and facilities are in good condition and include a water supply system  maintenance shop  warehouse  living quarters  a dining facility  administration building and a national guard post 
we also share a housing facility located near the town of el callao with units for approximately families 
mine electric power is purchased from eleoriente a state owned electric company 
diesel powered electric generators are available on site for operation of critical equipment during power outages 
at december   the net book value of the la camorra mine property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million 
our reclamation plan has been approved by the ministry of environment and natural resources 
planned activities include recontouring and revegetation of disturbed areas 
the reclamation and closure accrual as of december   was million 
at december   there were hourly and salaried employees associated with the la camorra mine 
the hourly employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  the contract for which expires in june in an effort to reduce the workforce at the la camorra mine  as a result of reaching the end of the known mine life there in june  the contract for the collective bargaining agreement provided incentives for a substantial number of hourly workers to voluntarily terminate during approximately workers accepted the voluntary termination incentive  and we have recorded a total cost to operations of approximately million  primarily in the first half of in addition  there were employees at the administrative office in puerto ordaz as of december  information with respect to the la camorra mine s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  proven ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces probable ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces total proven and probable ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces the company s estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on a gold price of and per ounce  respectively  in and proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
the year end proven and probable reserves decrease in tonnage and grade  as well as an associated decrease in ounces when compared to the year end proven and probable reserves  are a result of mining depletion of  tons in  not extending reserve limits in and encountering lower than expected grade in development areas compared to the grade estimated in the reserve estimate 
at the end of  the la camorra mine development of the vein system was complete within feet vertical of the reserve limit 
accordingly  proven and probable ore reserve estimates at the la camorra mine were primarily based on polygonal estimates from development headings and drilling with spacing of to feet 
cutoff grade assumptions were developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs 
the cutoff grade at la camorra was ounces of gold per ton 
proven and probable ore reserves were exhausted at the la camorra mine in june we also have the exploration rights to approximately  hectares square miles adjacent to the la camorra mine 
this property is controlled through eight different contracts with the venezuelan state owned development company  corporacion venezolana de guayana  as well as five different concessions with the ministry of basic industries and mines formerly the ministry of energy and mines 
the contracts and concessions were granted at various times with expiration dates between and  and most are renewable for a period of to years 
in  proven and probable reserves decreased at the la camorra mine as the deposit exhibited lower ore grades 
no significant exploration results were returned from drilling on the la camorra veins during  and we reached the end of 
table of contents the known mine life at the la camorra mine in june however  continued exploration activity has focused on the delineation of new auriferous zones on the concessions surrounding the la camorra concession 
work in consisted of linecutting  geological  geochemical and geophysical surveying 
many new drill targets were identified by this work and drilling is planned in the future once permitting requirements are met 
block b in march  we acquired the block b exploration and mining lease near el callao in the venezuelan state of bol var from cvg minerven  a venezuelan government owned gold mining company 
the lease runs through march the area s mining history dates back to the s 
block b is a seven square mile property position in the el callao gold mining district and contains many historic mines including the chile  laguna and panama mines  which collectively produced over million ounces of gold between and pursuant to the lease agreement  we will pay cvg minerven a royalty of to on production from block b  based on production levels 
the royalty terms are i if the price of gold is below per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment  ii if the price of gold is equal or greater than and equal to or below per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment  and iii if the price of gold is greater than per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  in royalty expense was incurred relating to production at block b 
the el callao area is located approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz in the eastern venezuelan state of bol var  and is just a short distance from highway  a paved two lane road running from upata south to the brazilian border 
overall good infrastructure exists and an kw electricity power line supplies the area predominantly populated by miners operating underground small scale mines 
the population of el callao is approximately  people 
geologically  the gold is found in shear zone hosted quartz veins and stockworks in proterozoic greenstone volcanics  primarily andesitic to basaltic lavas and pyroclastics 
gold occurs as free gold in quartz and is also commonly associated with coarse grained pyrite 
upon acquisition  exploration began on the chile vein system  which we believed to host high grade gold mineralization 
the chile mine itself was an important gold producer that historically produced more than  ounces of gold at an average grade of over one ounce per ton 
since the mine shut down in the s  two phases of exploration drilling were undertaken prior to our work in the block b lease area  one in the s  and more recent drill testing in the s that encountered high grades west of the old mine 
during and  we completed an exploration drilling campaign including drill holes and  feet of drilling resulting in the discovery of what we refer to as mina isidora  which we access via a ramp and an inclined shaft 
during  production at mina isidora included  tons of ore and  ounces of gold 
mina isidora ore is shipped to the mill at the la camorra concession for beneficiation 
at december   the net book value for the development of mina isidora and related plant and equipment totaled million 
in addition  we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of million 
at december   there were salaried and hourly employees associated with block b 
information with respect to mina isidora s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  proven ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces probable ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces total proven and probable ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces 
table of contents proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
an independent audit of the reserve model for mina isidora was completed by scott wilson roscoe postle associates inc in our estimates of proven and probable reserves were based on a gold price of  and per ounce  respectively  in  and proven and probable ore reserves at mina isidora are based on diamond drill hole spacing of to feet  and estimated using geostatistical modeling 
cutoff grade assumptions are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs 
the changes to the mina isidora ore reserves in compared to and in compared to are attributed to additional drill data  changes in modeling techniques  changes in mining assumptions  mining depletion and costs 
the cutoff grade at isidora is ounces of gold per ton 
during exploration drilling at and adjacent to the isidora mine was successful in outlining several new potential zones of economic mineralization 
a possible down plunge extension of the s vein was discovered returning ounces of gold per ton over feet 
this intersection is located approximately feet below the currently defined resource block 
a new parallel vein shear was discovered approximately  feet to the west of the isidora mine and feet north in the footwall of the s vein 
the uppermost part of this structure returned low gold values 
however  at a depth of feet  three potentially economic intercepts were returned over a strike length of feet 
values of ounces per ton over a width of feet  ounces per ton over feet and ounces per ton over feet were returned 
exploration work at mina isidora in will consist of follow up drilling of the potential economic intersections discovered below and adjacent to the isidora mine during the exploration program 
these holes will target targeting mineralization approximately feet below the current economic mineral resource at a vertical depth of feet 
additional holes will be drilled along strike to the east to explore for other zones of deep mineralization 
at least  feet are planned 
outside the mina isidora area  other exploration work on the block b concessions has included geologic mapping  geophysical surveying  geochemical sampling and  feet of exploration diamond drilling 
this work led to the discovery of two mineralized zones  the twin and conductora mineralized zones  located approximately one kilometer northeast of the mina isidora orebody 
the twin structure was discovered through drilling during the second quarter of  and is host to a large mineralized zone known as the twin mineralized zone 
the twin mineralized zone has a minimum strike length of  feet and a minimum vertical extent of  feet  and is still open down dip and along strike 
mineralization is somewhat erratic with values ranging from ounces per ton to over ounces per ton and widths from three feet to over feet 
the gold mineralization is associated with disseminated pyrite in a moderate to strong schistose shear zone  with moderate to intense ankerite sericite alteration and minor quartz veining 
the conductora structure  which is a possible extension to the northeast of the twin structure  is a second shear zone that has been traced over a strike length of about  feet and is still open in both directions along strike and also down dip 
the structure is host to the conductora mineralized zone  which has erratic gold values associated with sulphides in narrow  quartz veins and or wide zones of quartz veinlets in moderate to intensely schistose rocks with strong ankerite sericite alteration 
the significance of the twin conductora discovery is that it outlines a previously unidentified shear structure and a new style of mineralization on the block b concession that might exist in other unexplored areas 
exploration work has also been completed on the panama santa rita a lode structure situated approximately one mile to the northeast of the isidora mine 
drilling has encountered encouraging values of between to ounces per ton to as high as ounces per ton  and defines a distinct zone of mineralization that is open to depth 
we are currently reviewing the results from the programs completed in and and formulating plans for another drilling campaign late in custom milling business during  we completed construction of a small scale crushing and sampling plant on the block b concessions that allows us to purchase ore produced from small underground mines in the area 
ore purchased from the small mines are crushed  sampled and assayed at the sampling plant  and then trucked to the mill at the la camorra mine for further beneficiation 
the sampling plant is designed to process up to tons of purchased ore per day 
payment for the ore is calculated and made to the miners generally within three days of assaying of the ore 
we also purchase ore and gold bearing sands from small mining groups and suppliers in the el dorado and el callao areas  which are shipped directly to the mill at the la camorra mine 
as a part of this program  we provide small mine operators with financing and technical assistance  including technical advice on mining techniques  grade controls and safety standards 
the small mine activity in venezuela is a significant part of the country s mining industry  and we believe working with the miners provides goodwill and develops positive relationships with local mining groups  as well as assistance to the communities that are impacted by our operations 
we have received a positive response from local and national politicians and citizens for our efforts in helping the small mining cooperatives to improve their practices  and for assisting in providing a stimulus to the local economy 
as part of the custom milling business  we enter into contracts with the small mining groups and advance funds in the form of equipment and working capital  and collect such advances from ore delivered to the sampling and crushing plant 
as of december   we had unrecouped advances to small mining cooperatives totaling million  net of a reserve of million  for geologic and technical factors which inhibit recoupment from the small miner community 
the net book value for the plant and equipment associated with the custom milling business at december  was million 
in addition  we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of million

production from the don sergio vein was from a high grade gold vein with some silver credits 
mineral concession titles are obtained and held under the laws of mexico  and are valid for years with the possibility of extending another years 
there are work assessment and tax requirements that are variable and increase with the time that the concession is held 
several intermediate sulfidation epithermal veins occur within the saladillo valley and include the francine  profesor  middle and north vein systems 
these veins are proximal to each other and are hosted within a series of shales with interbedded fine grained sandstones interpreted to belong to the cretaceous caracol formation 
the don sergio  jessica  andrea and antonella veins located in the cerro pedernalillo area  about miles from francine  are end member low sulfidation epithermal veins hosted by the same formation with the addition of dioritic intrusive rocks 
underground development along the francine vein started in may  and reached full production during the second quarter of mining of economic ore on the upper francine vein was completed during the first quarter of the mine has been placed on care and maintenance as exploration continues on the property  including the hugh zone  which is located feet below historic mining 
mining of economic ore on the don sergio vein was completed in the fourth quarter of and reclamation of this portion of the mine site was completed during san sebastian s life of mine production over four years was million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold 
the francine vein strikes northwest and dips southwest  and is located on the southwestern limb of a doubly plunging anticline 
the vein ranges in true thickness from more than feet to less than feet  and consists of several episodes of banded quartz  silica healed breccias and minor amounts of calcite 
the vein is oxidized to a depth of approximately vertical feet and the wall rocks contain an alteration halo of less than feet next to the vein 
mineralization within the oxidized portion of the vein contains limonite  hematite  silver halides and various copper carbonates 
higher grade gold and silver mineralization is associated with disseminated hematite and limonite after pyrite and chalcopyrite  copper carbonates including malachite and azurite and hydrous copper silicates including chrysocolla 
native gold occurs associated with hematite and limonite 
mineralization in the sulfide portion of the francine vein contains pyrite  chalcopyrite  sphalerite  galena  native silver  argentite and trace amounts of aguilarite 
hugh zone mineralization contains chalcopyrite  sphalerite  galena  argentite  acanthite  tetrahedrite  polybasite  stephanite  freibergite  and pyrargyrite 
access to both underground workings has been through ramps from the surface connecting one or more levels 
ore has been mined by the cut and fill stoping method and extracted from the stopes using rubber tired equipment and hauled to the surface in trucks 
run of mine ore has been hauled in trucks by contractors to our processing facility near velarde a  which is approximately miles from the san sebastian mine and miles from the don sergio mine 
the mill is a conventional leach  counter current decantation and merrill crowe precipitation circuit 
the ore has been crushed in a two stage crushing plant consisting of a primary jaw  a secondary cone crusher and a double deck vibrating screen 
the grinding circuit includes a primary ball mill and cyclone classifiers 
the ground ore was thickened  followed by agitated leaching and four stages of counter current decantation to wash solubilized silver and gold from the pulp 
the solution bearing silver and gold was clarified  deaerated and zinc dust added to precipitate silver and gold that is recovered in plate and frame filters 
the precious

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview established in in northern idaho s silver valley  hecla mining company has distinguished itself as a respected precious metals producer with a rich history of mining 
headquartered in coeur d alene  idaho  this international  nyse traded company is years old 
in  we continued to build on our silver operations and exploration potential 
for eight consecutive quarters  our silver operations gross profit has exceeded million per quarter  and we ended with the lowest silver cash costs per ounce in our history 
we improved our production of silver to million ounces in  up slightly from production of lead and zinc  important by products at our lucky friday and greens creek mines  also improved in gold production declined  however  as the known existing reserve at our la camorra mine in venezuela was exhausted and all production was shifted to the nearby mina isidora mine 
despite reduced gold production  our revenues were million in  which was higher than revenues of million reported for improved silver  gold  and lead prices during supplemented increases from our higher silver and base metal production  although the average zinc price declined by approximately 
the average total cash cost per silver ounce for was our lowest ever at negative  an improvement from last year s 
total cash cost per gold ounce increased  however  from in to in as a result of higher transportation  labor  and supplies costs  as well as distribution of fixed costs to fewer gold ounces 
earnings in totaled per diluted share  per share less than in gross profit from operations was within of its level  and pre production costs incurred at the hollister development block were million less than in  due to the sale of hollister in april furthermore  we recorded a gain of million on asset sales in versus million in however  we also recorded in a non cash charge of million for environmental accruals related to idaho s coeur d alene basin  which had no comparable event in meanwhile  the balance of our cash and equivalents grew by million in versus million in our sale of over two million shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock in december  for net proceeds of million  was instrumental in the growth of our cash balance 
the factors driving metals prices are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
while prices rebounded in and sustained their high levels in  we remain at risk for downturns in prices 
average prices in compared to those in and are illustrated in the results of operations section below 
on february   we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in the greens creek mine for total consideration of million  which will result in various subsidiaries of ours holding ownership of greens creek 
greens creek is regarded as the world s fifth largest silver mine  and is among the lowest cost silver mines in north america 
the transaction is anticipated to almost double our annual silver production and have a positive impact on our silver cost per ounce 
in addition  on february   we announced an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of independence lead mines company 
on february   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary  rio grande silver inc  acquired the right to earn into a joint venture interest in an approximately square mile consolidated land package in the creede mining district of colorado

continued focus on acquiring new assets to accelerate growth 
key issues we expect our strategy to increase production and expand our proven and probable reserves will be implemented by development and exploration  as well as by future acquisitions 
our strategic plan requires that we overcome several pervasive challenges and risks inherent in conducting mining  development  exploration and metal sales in multiple international locations 
one such challenge is metals prices 
while the metals mining industry enjoyed continued strength in metals prices from through  we have very little control over prices 
we must make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future revenues  which is a daunting challenge to an industry for which new opportunities can require many years and substantial cost from discovery to production 
we approach this challenge by investing exploration and capital in districts with an established history of success  and in managing our operations in a manner that seeks to mitigate the effects of lower prices 
another challenge is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities may change in the future  as they did in  and that our strategic plans could be affected as a result 
in accordance with our environmental policy  our operating activities will be conducted in a manner that attempts to minimize risks to public health and safety 
we believe that natural resources can be developed and utilized in a manner consistent with proper stewardship for the environment  and plan to design and manage our projects in an attempt to reasonably minimize risk and negative effects on the environment 
we will continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we face challenges also from political  social  and regulatory change in venezuela 
in  our cash balance increased in venezuela by million  to million translated at the official exchange rate of  bol vars to  as a result of the criminal exchange act  which regulates the movement of cash from venezuela at the official rate 
we are able to repatriate cash to the us  however  in doing so  we must utilize specific government programs that have been limited  or utilize negotiable instruments on which we have incurred losses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
another challenge to us in venezuela is the government s view on strategic industries 
through  the government announced the intention of nationalizing strategic industries  including petroleum  communications  and banking 
while mining has not been mentioned as a strategic industry  we will continue to monitor the government s view of the mining industry in venezuela 
reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining 
our reserve estimates  which drive our mining and investment plans and many of our costs  may change based on economic factors and actual production experience 
we particularly face challenges with regards to our gold reserves  which declined by approximately in after strong production from the la camorra mine since acquisition by us in  the mine was closed in the second quarter of due to depletion of reserves 
the nearby mina isidora mine  which utilizes the processing plant at la camorra  continues to produce as designed with over  ounces in reserves  and plan to continue our exploration programs in both the el callao and el dorado districts of venezuela in results of operations for the year ended december   we reported income applicable to common shareholders of million  compared to income applicable to common shareholders of million in and a loss applicable to common shareholders of million in the following factors positively impacted the results for the year ended december   compared to and increased gross profit at our lucky friday and greens creek units see the lucky friday segment and greens creek segment sections below for further discussion of operating results

the positive impact of these factors on our operating results  compared to and  was partially offset by the following an increase of million in in our estimated liabilities for environmental remediation in idaho s coeur d alene basin and the bunker hill superfund site 
during the second quarter of  we finalized a proposed multi year clean up plan for the upper portion of the coeur d alene basin  together with an estimate of related costs to implement the plan 
based on that work and a reassessment of our other potential liabilities in the basin  we increased our accrual for remediation in the basin by million 
we also accrued an additional million for the remaining bunker hill superfund site work 
for additional discussion  see bunker hill superfund site and coeur d alene river basin environmental claims in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we committed to a donation of our common stock valued at million in for the creation of hecla charitable foundation  an organization that will fund charitable contributions in the communities in which hecla holds mining interests

the increase in gross profit in  compared to and  resulted primarily from higher average silver and lead prices and increased production  partially offset by lower ore grades 
full production on the level expansion was reached in the fourth quarter of  resulting in approximately  ounces of silver mined from the level during upgrades to the mill in  and have resulted in operating efficiencies that  when coupled with the increased production from the level  increased tonnage milled in by compared to  despite eight and a half days of lost mill operation during the third quarter of due to plugged tailings lines 
however  the production improvements were partially offset by a decrease in silver ore grade due to the nature of the current ore body and increased zinc production 
the improvement in total cash costs per silver ounce in  as compared to and  is attributed to higher lead and zinc by product credits resulting primarily from increased average lead prices and higher production for both metals 
mining at wider strike lengths and wider faces at the lucky friday has allowed us to take advantage of the high base metals prices 
ore was mined at greater widths to include stringers that give us access to zinc that otherwise would not be mined 
this results in an economic benefit  but also temporarily lowers the silver ore grade below life of mine reserve levels  as anticipated  and delays some silver production to later periods 
increased productivity and lower transportation costs  due to increased production from the level  have also contributed to the improved total cash cost per ounce 
while value from lead and zinc is significant at the lucky friday  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
the recent increase in the lead price changed the balance of revenue for lucky friday  so that lead competed with silver for the largest portion of total revenue in we will continue to monitor the relationship of revenue contribution among the metals produced from lucky friday  however  until lead sustains its high price relative to silver for a longer period  we continue to view silver as our primary product 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset increases in operating costs due to the increased average prices

gross profit in  which was substantially the same as  was impacted by increased production costs  partially offset by higher silver  gold and zinc prices 
the higher production costs were due in large part to the rising cost of diesel fuel and an increased use of contract labor  as increasing industry competitiveness has resulted in a shortage of experienced miners 
the increase in gross profit during  compared to  was primarily the result of higher average metals prices  partially offset by the effects of mine rehabilitation work and higher diesel prices 
ground falls in various areas of the mine in the third quarter of resulted in the allocation of resources to rehabilitation work 
throughout  greens creek continued to focus manpower and equipment on mine rehabilitation work relating to ground support reinforcement in the main haulage ways 
underground congestion caused by alternative truck routing  and the lack of available mine ore faces both results of the focus on rehabilitation work decreased production during the first six months of a mining contract company was engaged during the second quarter of to help maintain production and reduce the effects of the rehabilitation work  and ore production for the second half of was higher compared to the same period of as a result 
throughout  greens creek continued to utilize the contract mining company to maintain production levels and provide ore access development 
the greens creek operation is partially powered by diesel generators  and production costs have been significantly affected by increasing fuel prices 
infrastructure has been installed that allows hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by alaska electric light and power company ael p  via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
ael p had agreed to supply power to greens creek  however  low lake levels and increased demand in the juneau area have combined to decrease power available to greens creek 
as a result  it is unlikely that greens creek will obtain significant utility power until the improvement in total cash costs per silver ounce in  compared to  is attributable to increased by product credits  as lead and gold prices exceeded prices during the same period  partially offset by higher production costs 
the improvement in total cash cost per silver ounce in  versus  was due to increased by product credits  as zinc  lead  and gold prices exceeded prices during the same period 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  
table of contents the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  in most of its working areas  greens creek generally utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery  and the recent increase in the zinc price changed the balance of revenue for greens creek  so that zinc competed with silver for the largest portion of total revenue in and we will continue to monitor the relationship of revenue contribution among the metals produced from greens creek  however  until zinc sustains its high price relative to silver for a longer period  we continue to view silver as our primary product 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset increases in operating costs due to increased prices 
on february   we announced an agreement to purchase all of the shares of the rio tinto subsidiaries that hold the remaining interest in the greens creek mine  which will result in our various subsidiaries holding ownership of greens creek 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the reduction in gross profit for  compared to and  primarily resulted from escalating labor  commodity and transportation costs 
the higher transportation costs are related to haulage of ore mined from mina isidora and ore purchased from small third party mining operations to our milling facility located approximately miles from mina isidora 
reduced production from the la camorra mine due to mining at greater depths  lower productivity  lower gold grades  and reduced reserves 
we reached the end of the currently known mine life there in june  and production from the la camorra unit has transitioned primarily to mina isidora 
a temporary suspension of operations at mina isidora during the second quarter of a road blockade in early may disrupted access to mina isidora and impacted gold production 
the issues with the community and a small number of employees resulting in the blockade  which primarily consisted of hecla continuing its program of improving local infrastructure  were resolved  and operations at the mine were restored at the beginning of the third quarter of gold dor pours resumed in august million in expense recognized in related to voluntary termination of personnel at the la camorra mine 
we increased the provision for materials and supplies inventory impairment at our la camorra segment to million at december   from million at december   with the adjustment recorded as a charge to cost of sales and other direct production costs 
these factors were partially offset by million in transaction gains on local gold sales in venezuela  which are included in sales for the la camorra segment  compared to million in there were no such gains in 
table of contents in order to mine more efficiently at greater depths and potentially develop further proven and probable reserves  we made the decision in to construct a production shaft at the la camorra mine  which was placed into service during the third quarter of however  proven and probable ore reserves continued to decrease at the la camorra mine since  as it exhibited lower ore grades  and no significant results have been returned from drilling in the la camorra vicinity 
as a result  reduced production levels from the la camorra mine continued  and we reached the end of the known mine life there in june depreciation expense related to the shaft has negatively affected gross profit for the la camorra unit since it was commissioned  and continued to do so until the shaft was depreciated to its salvage value in the second quarter of we have applied for permits in order to continue exploration activity on concessions surrounding the la camorra mine during  however  no permits have been issued to us at this time 
we will continue to assess the carrying value of assets at the la camorra unit  and failure to obtain the permits necessary to continue exploration on concessions near the la camorra mine may cause us to reduce the carrying value of certain assets there 
the carrying value of assets at the la camorra mine  excluding the value of the la camorra mill  was approximately million at december  the construction of the production shaft was more costly and took longer than originally anticipated  and we disputed some of the shaft construction costs submitted by the contractor 
pursuant to the construction agreement  we submitted the matter to arbitration in november in january  the matter was resolved  resulting in a dismissal of the arbitration and all claims by each party against the other 
as a result of the settlement  we paid an additional million and recognized an additional million for the cost of the project in  as an accrual for million was already recorded 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
a strike at the la camorra mine suspended operations for days during the third quarter of the strike  along with subsequent labor issues  significantly impacted production at the la camorra unit during the second half of operations at our la camorra were suspended due to an additional day strike  which ended in december improvement in the total cash cost per ounce at the la camorra unit is anticipated in  due to higher gold grades at mina isidora  partially offset by the use of a more expensive mining method due to the dip of the vein  and increased ore transportation costs 
functional currency for venezuelan operations effective january   we implemented a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bol var  the national currency in venezuela 
we believe that significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances affecting our venezuelan operations indicate that a change in the functional currency is appropriate  under the provisions of sfas the functional currency change resulted in a reduction of approximately million in the carrying value of net assets  with a translation adjustment for the same amount recorded to the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income 
further discussion of the functional currency change can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business risks in venezuela currency and related risks the venezuelan criminal exchange law imposes strict criminal and economic sanctions on the exchange of venezuelan currency with other foreign currency under false pretenses 
approvals for foreign currency exchange are limited and we are evaluating opportunities to minimize our exposure to devaluation 
as a consequence  our cash balances denominated in bol vares  at the official rate of  bol vares to  that are maintained in venezuela have increased to a us dollar equivalent of approximately million at december   from million at december  additionally  during the next six months we are required to convert into venezuelan currency the proceeds from venezuelan export sales made over the past days  or a total value of approximately million 
during and  we exchanged the us dollar equivalent of approximately million and million  respectively  valued at the official exchange rate of  bol vares to  for approximately million and million at open market exchange rates  in compliance with applicable regulations  incurring foreign exchange losses for the difference 
approximately million and million of the conversion losses for and were incurred on the repatriation of cash from venezuela  and are included in net foreign exchange loss on the consolidated statement of operations 
additional losses of approximately million in and million in were related to conversions of bol vares for the payment of expatriate payroll and other us dollar denominated goods and services  and are included in the cost of sales and other direct production costs and exploration amounts reported on the consolidated statement of operations 
changes to the venezuelan criminal exchange law enacted in january prohibit the publication of bol var exchange rates other than the official rate 
although we are making the appropriate applications through the venezuelan government  our cash balances denominated in the venezuelan bol var may continue to grow and any future conversions or devaluation of the bol var may result in further losses when and if in the future we decide to distribute money outside venezuela 
seniat litigation our wholly owned subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv was involved in litigation in venezuela with seniat  the venezuelan tax authority  concerning alleged unpaid tax liabilities that predate our purchase of the la camorra mine from monarch resources investments limited monarch in pursuant to our purchase agreement  monarch has assumed defense of and responsibility for the pending tax case in the superior tax court in caracas 
in april  
table of contents seniat filed with the superior tax court in bol var city  state of bol var  an embargo action against all of mhv s assets in venezuela to secure the alleged unpaid tax liabilities 
in order to prevent the embargo  in april  mhv made a cash deposit with the court for the dollar equivalent of approximately million  at exchange rates in effect at that time 
in june  the superior tax court in caracas ordered suspension and revocation of the embargo action filed by seniat  although the court retained the million pending settlement of the tax liabilities 
in october  mhv  monarch and seniat reached a mutual agreement to settle the case 
the terms of the agreement provided that mhv would pay approximately million in exchange for a release of the alleged tax liabilities  and paid the million in august this agreement was validated by the tax court that was hearing the case in march in a separate agreement  monarch agreed to reimburse mhv for all amounts expended in settling the case  including response costs  through a reduction in mhv s royalty obligations to monarch 
in june  the tax court released to mhv the deposit plus interest 
mhv subsequently paid million to monarch in settlement of mhv s royalty obligations less the legal costs and fees that monarch was obligated to pay in accordance with the prior settlement 
this matter is now resolved 
la camorra concession notice by letter dated october   the company s subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv  received notice from the venezuelan ministry for basic industries and mining mibam that it would commence administrative proceedings that it said could lead to the revocation of mhv s la camorra concession notice 
the notice said it was based upon the alleged exhaustion of the gold reserves at the la camorra concession and upon the alleged non payment of an extraction tax 
hecla has ongoing mining operations at mina isidora that process ore at the la camorra mill and has had  and plans to continue to have  independent contractors that extract ore from the la camorra concession 
if the la camorra concession is revoked  we may face additional costs or asset write downs 
for example  we have property  plant and equipment with book values at our la camorra concession 
fixed assets with book value totaling approximately million at december  may require write down if the concession is revoked without government compensation 
in addition  we would need to process the ore from our mina isidora mine at a different facility 
while milling capacity exists with other mining companies in the vicinity of mina isidora  we could incur additional costs for tolling our ore as opposed to hauling it to our la camorra mill for processing 
the company has not yet determined how much  if any  additional costs would be incurred 
we have filed a formal disagreement with mibam  and have not received a response 
we will continue to contest the notice vigorously  however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail 
other although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  there is a continued uncertainty in venezuela relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  as well as export and exchange control 
this uncertain environment could affect our operations  including by changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages  industry nationalization  seizures of assets  relationships with small mining groups in the vicinity of our mining operations  and impacting our supplies of oil  gas and other goods 
as a result  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations  and any such occurrences  if significant  could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations or financial position

significant exploration efforts have continued during and at the hugh zone and other exploration targets located on or near the san sebastian property  where we now hold square miles of contiguous concessions 
additional exploration activity at the san sebastian unit in included completion of initial drilling on a number of veins at our rio grande project  where our concession holdings cover approximately square miles 
we incurred million in exploration expenses during at the san sebastian unit  compared to million in and million in the national miners union initiated a strike at our velarde a mill in october  which prevented production at the san sebastian unit until it was resolved in june during the strike  costs related to our mining operations were included in the valuation of our stockpile inventory  while costs related to the idle mill were expensed as incurred 
upon resolution of the strike  mining activities resumed until october  at which time we reached the end of the known mine life 
the san sebastian mine and velarde a mill are currently on care and maintenance status as we continue exploration efforts 
sales reported for represent final settlement payments received on prior period dor shipments  and include revenue received from silver and gold contained in material remaining in the mill after operations ceased 
during periods of operation  gold has been considered a by product credit at the san sebastian unit 
while value from by product gold has been significant for san sebastian  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with gold as a by product  was appropriate because we have historically presented san sebastian as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  san sebastian is in a mining district historically identified with silver  exploration has been directed toward silver  and recent exploration results have shown a predominant silver content  and our mining methods and production planning have targeted silver as our primary product  which has been accompanied by a significant gold presence 
costs related to the velarde a mill strike and care and maintenance of the mine and mill of million were not included in the calculation of total cash costs per ounce 
corporate matters other significant variances affecting our results  as compared to results  were as follows overall decrease in exploration expense in of million  due primarily to the sale of the hollister development block project see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information  partially offset by increased costs for exploration activity at our san sebastian unit in mexico  the addition of our new office in vancouver  british columbia  and an exploration program to generate new projects underway in north idaho s silver valley 
lower pre development expense in  by million  as a result of the hollister sale discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

an increase in the provision for closed operations and environmental matters in of million  which includes a million adjustment to increase the accruals relating to the coeur d alene basin and bunker hill superfund site  as discussed further in the results of operations section above 
a million adjustment to increase the accrual related to the idle republic mine site  in the state of washington  and idle property expenses recognized during the second half of relating to the la camorra mine  as we reached the end of the known mine life there in june  also contributed to the higher expense

in addition  we are subject to a quarterly commitment fee  which totaled million in  on the unused portion of the amount available under the facility  and we also have costs related to amortization of the original loan fees associated with the facility 
we had an outstanding balance under the credit agreement of million at december   and borrowed an additional million in january the million balance was repaid in february  with no additional borrowings made during or  and no outstanding balance under the credit agreement at december  or december  an income tax benefit of million in  compared to an income tax provision of million in the income tax benefit is primarily the result of a decrease in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets

for the sole purpose of implementing a holding company structure  on november   an agreement and plan of reorganization was filed 
under that plan of reorganization  hecla mining company  a new delaware corporation organized on august   and formerly named hecla holdings inc  became the successor issuer to hecla limited  formerly named hecla mining company 
in addition  hecla limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of hecla mining company

total cash costs provide management and investors an indication of net cash flow  after consideration of the realized price received for production sold 
management also uses this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period to period from a cash flow perspective 
total cash cost per ounce is a measure developed by gold companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard  however  there can be no assurance that our reporting of this non gaap measure is similar to that reported by other mining companies 
cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs

mine and mill operations ceased in october during  cost of sales and other direct production costs of million were not included in the determination of total cash costs for silver operations 
san sebastian recognized depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million during  which is reflected in the total for all properties and combined silver properties above 
includes approximately  related to san sebastian cost of sales and other direct production costs during the first quarter of for prior period dor shipments 
ounces mined from the level development project at lucky friday are not included in the determination of total cash costs during  as commercial production levels from the expansion project had not yet been reached 
approximately  ounces of silver were excluded from the calculation 
costs per ounce of gold are based on the gold produced by the la camorra mine and our block b concessions  including mina isidora  only 
during the years ended december   and  a total of   and  ounces  respectively  were produced from third party mining operations located near the la camorra mine and block b concessions 
the revenues from these gold ounces were treated as a by product credit and included in the calculation of gold costs per ounce 
included in total cash costs for  and  were the costs to purchase the ore of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
incentives were offered at the la camorra mine for voluntary reduction of the workforce 
during the year ended december   these cost of sales and other direct production costs of million were not included in the determination of total cash costs for gold operations 
operations at the mina isidora mine in venezuela were closed during a portion of the second quarter of when a small group of local residents and employees blocked hecla employees from accessing the mine 
see the la camorra segment section above for more information 
cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion  and amortization totaling million were incurred during the second quarter of  and were not included in the total cash costs for gold operations 
financial liquidity and capital resources our liquid assets include in millions december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents held in us dollars cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currency adjustable rate securities marketable equity securities  current marketable equity securities  non current total cash  cash equivalents and investments the balance of our cash and cash equivalents increased by million in  up from an increase of million in and a decrease of million in significant reasons for the increase in cash flow in include sale in december of  shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock with proceeds of million  net of related fees  receipt of million for the divestment of the hollister development block project  net income adjusted for non cash elements in that exceeded last year s level by million  repayment in of a million then outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility  and decreased working capital and other non current assets and liabilities of million in the current year versus million last year 
the above increased year on year cash flows have been partly offset by sale of equity securities in for million  additions to properties  plants  and equipment that have exceeded last year s levels by million  and proceeds from asset sales in of million  primarily from our interest in the noche buena property in mexico 
in addition to the foregoing changes in cash and cash equivalents  our liquidity has been boosted by 
table of contents receipt of stock in great basin gold upon the sale of our interest in the hollister development block project  which was valued at million upon acquisition and increased in value subsequent to receipt  appreciation totaling million in the value of equity securities held by us  and release of a cash deposit of approximately million previously held by the tax court in venezuela  resulting in a reclassification from non current restricted cash and investments to cash and cash equivalents 
our current ratio at december  was to  up from to at december  the change was attributable primarily to growth in our cash and current investment balances resulting from the sale of preferred stock  cash flow from operations  and asset sales in  as well as to payment of current liabilities accrued at december  for the resolution of la camorra shaft arbitration 
liquidity for the next months will be provided by existing cash balances and maturities of short term investments  cash provided by operations  availability of our million revolving line of credit which extends to september  and issuance of securities pursuant to two extant registration statements that would allow us to issue a combination of common stock  additional preferred stock  warrants  and debt 
in addition  on february   we announced an agreement to acquire of the shares of the companies owning of the greens creek mine  where we currently own the remaining interest  for million 
the purchase price is comprised of million in cash and million in hecla common stock 
we have received million in committed debt financing  which will fund the acquisition  together with existing cash 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we believe that our existing financial position and plans for the coming year will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  exploration  and other corporate activities 
our plans for significant uses of cash in include the following million towards the transaction to purchase of the greens creek mine  as discussed above  capital expenditures of million  primarily related to sustaining and growth capital at our lucky friday mine  sustaining capital at greens creek mine in which we are a participant  and sustaining capital at our mina isidora operation in venezuela  exploration expenditures of approximately million  general funding of operations and general and administrative expenses  reclamation and other closure costs of approximately million  and potential acquisitions of mining properties or businesses as opportunities may arise 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  up from million in the same period last year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a million increase in net income  adjusted for non cash elements  and a million increase in working capital and other assets and liabilities in the versus a million increase in the comparable period last year 
these changes included accounts receivable decreased by million in versus a million increase in due to the timing of shipments to smelters 
furthermore  rising metals prices in resulted in higher product values than in  inventories decreased by million in  yielding more cash than the million decrease in due to the timing of shipments to smelters and reduced inventories of gold dor in venezuela  and offsetting the above cash flows  liabilities accrued at december  for the resolution of la camorra shaft arbitration were paid in the first quarter of our net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to a use of million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to higher net income  adjusted for non cash elements  by million in the primary driver of higher income was favorable metals prices  with all four metals produced by us at levels exceeding average prices by over  and timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of our business  with non cash working capital decreasing by 
million in 
table of contents investing activities cash provided by investing activities totaled million in  up from million in the main differences between the years include net maturities of short term variable rate investments 
in  these investments increased by million  while in the current year  they decreased by million  and receipt of million in proceeds from the venezuelan government for cash posted in to prevent an embargo related to an income tax matter 
partially offset by higher investment by million in in property  plant  and equipment  primarily as a result of projects at our lucky friday mine  and lower proceeds from asset sales in in  we received million for the sale of our interest in the hollister development block 
in  we received million from asset sales  including the sale of alamos stock and our noche buena property 
our net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to cash applied in totaling million 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of our interest in alamos gold  inc totaling million  lower investment in property  plant  and equipment by million as we completed the shaft project in venezuela  and proceeds from asset sales totaling million in  primarily for our interest in the noche buena property in mexico 
partially offset by net purchases of short term investments in compared to net sales in as our cash position strengthened 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  in contrast to cash used in of million  due to our sale of  shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock in yielded million  proceeds from stock option exercises in were higher than in by million as more options were exercised due to higher stock prices in the current year  and in  we repaid our million balance on our revolving loan facility  while in  the facility carried no balance 
our net cash used by financing activities totaled million in  compared to million used in the increase in cash provided in was primarily due to increased proceeds from stock issued pursuant to stock option plans in  and decreased payments of dividends to holders of preferred shares due to payment of dividends in arrears in these factors were partially offset by repayment of million on our revolving loan facility in  compared to million in borrowings in

included in these amounts are approximately million and million related to various capital projects at the lucky friday and greens creek units  respectively 
in september  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement subject to an interest rate of above the london interbank offered rate or an alternate base rate plus 
there was no outstanding balance under the credit agreement at december  each quarter  we pay a commitment fee of of the unused balance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
as of december   we were committed to approximately million for various capital projects at the lucky friday  greens creek and la camorra units 
total contractual obligations at december  also include approximately million related to ore transportation and other non capital cost commitments at the la camorra unit and approximately million for commitments relating to non capital items at greens creek our share 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
on february   we announced an agreement to purchase the remaining of the greens creek mine for million 
the purchase price is comprised of million in cash  including a million nonrefundable deposit  million of which may be funded through committed debt financing  and million in hecla common stock

gold production from our la camorra mine and block b property in venezuela is subject to royalties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the royalty provisions 
the amount of our royalty obligations is dependent upon the number of gold ounces produced and the gold price 
based on our current projections for production at block b  and the average gold price for  we estimate our future royalty payments will be million for  million for and million for within the area mined by lucky friday  we control the gold hunter property under a long term operating agreement with independence lead mines company independence expiring in february and renewable thereafter  that entitles us  as operator  to an interest in the net profits from operations from the gold hunter property 
under the current agreement  we would be obligated to pay a net profits interest of to independence after we have recouped our costs to explore and develop the property 
recoupment depends on  among other factors  metals prices and the extent of capital invested in lucky friday 
in february  we announced an agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of independence  which would result in our ownership of of the property 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the agreement 
we maintain reserves for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our reserves for these matters totaled million  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic  political  regulatory  and other factors that affect our business prospects 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  and mineral reserves  as they require us to make assumptions that were 
table of contents highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made  and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical 
however  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
future metals prices metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities  including properties  plants and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accounts receivable 
as shown under item a 
risk factors  metals prices have been historically volatile 
while average prices for all four metals we produce have performed favorably for five consecutive years  we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices in the past  and we can offer no assurance that prices will remain at their current levels or higher 
processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analyses of asset carrying values  depreciation  and deferred income taxes 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant we examine the carrying values of our assets  our depreciation rates  and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in our analyses of carrying values and deferred taxes  we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model  including current prices  forward curve prices  and historical prices see mineral reserves  below  regarding prices used for reserve estimates 
using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets  we use the most likely outcome to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated  and to determine the level of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
future metals prices also affect our assessment of recoverability of certain accounts receivable 
we hold accounts receivable from various mining cooperatives in venezuela from whom we purchase custom ores and sands 
our assessment of gold prices helps us to assess the future profitability of the cooperatives  which  in turn  informs the level of recoverability of receivables from the cooperatives 
obligations for environmental  reclamation and closure matters the most significant liability on our balance sheet is for accrued reclamation and closure costs 
we have conducted considerable remediation work at sites in the united states for which remediation requirements have not been fully determined  nor have they been agreed between us and various regulatory agencies with oversight over the properties 
we have estimated our liabilities with counsel and in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if warranted management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee 
however  the range of liability proposed by the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings considerably exceeds the liabilities we have recognized 
if substantial damages were awarded or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
mineral reserves critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves 
our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices  as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade  accessibility and production cost 
metals prices are estimated at long term averages  as described in item property descriptions 
our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually  and periodically utilizes external audits 
reserves are a key component in valuation of our properties  plants and equipment 
reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units of production depreciation  with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves 
reserves are also a key component in forecasts  with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately 
reserves represent a culmination of many estimates  and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of no 
arb  which is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  sfas no 
amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling ownership interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement on our consolidated financial statements and at this time we do not anticipate a material effect 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
business combinations 
the revised standard is effective for transactions where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas no 
r will change the accounting for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 

table of contents acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests formally known as minority interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense

risk factors 
cash and foreign currency conversion exchange control regulations in venezuela have limited our ability to repatriate cash and receive dividends or other distributions without substantial cost 
at december  and december   we held the us dollar equivalent of approximately million and million  respectively  denominated in the venezuelan bol var at the rate of  bolivares to 
additionally  during the next six months we are required to convert into venezuelan currency the proceeds of venezuelan export sales made over the past days  approximately million 
exchanging our cash held in local currency into us dollars can be done through specific governmental programs  or through the use of negotiable instruments at conversion rates that are higher than the official rate parallel rate on which we have incurred and may incur additional foreign currency losses 
during and  we exchanged the us dollar equivalent of approximately and million  respectively  at the official exchange rate of  bolivares to for and million at open market exchange rates  incurring a foreign exchange loss for the difference 
although we are making appropriate applications through the venezuelan government  our cash balances denominated in venezuelan bol vares may continue to grow and any future conversions may result in further losses when and if we decide to distribute money outside venezuela 
converting our december  bol var denominated cash balances to dollars at the parallel exchange rate at february  would result in a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 

table of contents short term investments our december  short term investments of million  consisting of auction rate securities  were subject to changes in market interest rates and were sensitive to those changes 
our short term investments were subject to a weighted average interest rate of and mature over the next twelve months 
commodity price risk management at times  we use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures 
interest rate risk management at december   we had no debt outstanding 
however  our revolving credit facility  if used  would be subject to changes in market interest rates 
for additional information regarding our million revolving credit facility  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
venezuelan currency exchange rates effective january   we implemented a change in the functional currency for our venezuelan operations from the us dollar to the bolivar  the national currency in venezuela 
as a result of this change  the us dollar equivalent value of the non monetary assets of our venezuela operation would fluctuate with a change in the official exchange rate of the bolivar 
implementation of the functional currency change  using the current official exchange rate of  bolivares to  resulted in a reduction to net assets of approximately million  with a translation adjustment for the same amount recorded to the opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income 
a increase in the official exchange rate would result in an additional reduction to net assets of approximately million
