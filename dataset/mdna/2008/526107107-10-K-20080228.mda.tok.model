item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in four reportable business segments of the hvacr industry 
the first reportable segment is residential heating cooling  in which we manufacture and market a full line of heating  air conditioning and hearth products for the residential replacement and new construction markets in the us and canada 
the second reportable segment is commercial heating cooling  in which we manufacture and sell rooftop products and related equipment for light commercial applications in the us and canada and primarily rooftop products  chillers and air handlers in europe 
the third reportable segment is service experts  which includes sales  installation  maintenance  and repair services for hvac equipment by company owned service centers in the us and canada 
the fourth reportable segment is refrigeration  in which we manufacture and sell unit coolers  condensing units and other commercial refrigeration products in the us and international markets 
our products and services are sold through a combination of distributors  independent and company owned dealer service centers  other installing contractors  wholesalers  manufacturers representatives  original equipment manufacturers and to national accounts 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
hotter than normal summers generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winters have the same effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress hvacr sales and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and 
table of contents demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence 
the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in our service experts segment  the principal components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
higher prices for these commodities and related components continue to present a challenge to us and the hvacr industry in general 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices through a combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we estimate approximately of the sales of our residential heating cooling segment is for new construction  with the balance attributable to repair  retrofit and replacement 
with the current downturn in residential new construction activity  we are seeing a decline in the demand for the products and services we sell into this market 
our fiscal year ends on december and our interim fiscal quarters are each comprised of weeks 
for convenience  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the calendar quarter

adoption of sab no 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab no 

the transition provisions of sab no 
permitted us to adjust for the cumulative effect in retained earnings for immaterial errors relating to prior periods 
in accordance with sab no 
 we reduced retained earnings as of january  by million to reflect understatements in product warranty liabilities caused by misstatements that occurred in prior years 
the resulting adjustments did not affect previously reported cash flows from operations and the impact on prior years financial position and results of operations was immaterial 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the total cumulative impact is as follows in millions retained earnings deferred income taxes product warranty liability accounting for futures contracts in connection with our year end procedures related to the accounting for futures contracts for copper and aluminum  we determined that certain of our futures contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as our documentation did not meet the criteria specified by sfas no 
in order for the hedging instruments to qualify for cash flow designation 
this determination resulted in two different types of adjustments to our quarterly consolidated financial statements for the year ended december

these transfers are accounted for as sales rather than secured borrowings 
the fair values assigned to the retained and transferred interests are based primarily on the receivables carrying value given the short term to maturity and low credit risk 
as of december  and  we had not sold any beneficial interests in accounts receivable 
as of december   million of cash and cash equivalents were restricted primarily due to routine lockbox collections and letters of credit issued with respect to the operations of our captive insurance subsidiary  which expire on december  these letter of credit restrictions can be transferred to our revolving lines of credit as needed

table of contents on july   we announced that our board of directors approved the share repurchase plan  pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to million of shares of our common stock through open market purchases 
based on the closing price of our common stock on july   a million repurchase represented over of our market capitalization 
we are currently funding the stock repurchases through a combination of cash from operations and third party borrowings 
we plan to fully execute repurchases under the share repurchase plan by the end of the third quarter of during  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share  including commissions  under the share repurchase plan  representing approximately of the million repurchase authorization 
the share repurchase plan terminated and replaced our former share repurchase plan  announced on september   pursuant to which we were authorized to repurchase up to ten million shares of our common stock the share repurchase plan 
purchases under the share repurchase plan were made on an open market basis at prevailing market prices 
the timing of any repurchases depended on market conditions  the market price of our common stock and management s assessment of our liquidity needs and investment requirements and opportunities 
we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share  including commissions  under the share repurchase plan 
we periodically review our capital structure  including our primary bank facility  to ensure that it has adequate liquidity 
we believe that cash flows from operations  as well as available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other existing sources of funding  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and the share repurchases during the term of the share repurchase plan 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the revolving and term loans described above  we utilize the following financing arrangements in the course of funding our operations trade accounts receivable may be sold on a non recourse basis to third parties

due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of payments associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period for which these liabilities might be paid

the majority of our service experts segment s motor vehicle fleet is leased through operating leases 
the lease terms are generally non cancelable for the first month term and then are month to month  cancelable at our option 
while there are residual value guarantees on these vehicles  we have not historically made significant payments to the lessors as the leases are maintained until the fair value of the assets fully mitigates our obligations under the lease agreements

net sales and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the period 
during  and  net sales from outside the us represented  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
historically  foreign currency transaction gains losses have not had a material effect on our overall operations 
as of december   the impact to net income of a change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately million 
our results of operations can be affected by changes in interest rates due to variable rates of interest on our revolving credit facilities 
a change in interest rates would not be material to our results of operations 
currently  we utilize various alternatives to mitigate higher raw material costs  including cash flow and economic hedges and fixed forward contracts 
we enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content 
these contracts are for quantities equal to  or less than  quantities expected to be consumed in future production 
as of december   we had metal futures contracts maturing at various dates through may with a fair value as a liability of million 
the impact of a change in commodity prices would have a significant impact on our results from operations on an annual basis  absent any other contravening actions

the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how such policies can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
we consider our most critical accounting policies to be product warranties  goodwill and other intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension and postretirement benefits  stock based compensation  self insurance expense  income taxes  and derivative accounting
