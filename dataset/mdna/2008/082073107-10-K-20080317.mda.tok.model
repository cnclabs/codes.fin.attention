operating results 
for the year ended december   benjamin franklin bancorp earned million  or 
per diluted share 
per basic share compared to million  or 
per share basic and diluted for the year benjamin franklin bancorp s results of operations are dependent mainly on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and interest expense incurred on its deposits and borrowed funds 
results of operations are also affected by fee and other income from banking and non banking operations  gains losses on sales of loans and securities available for sale  as well as operating expenses  provisions for loan losses  and federal and state income taxes 

table of contents the company s net interest income increased by  or  comparing the years and the net interest margin for the two years was and  respectively 
growth in net interest income and margin has been extremely challenging in light of both the competition for loans and deposits  and an adverse interest rate environment over the past several years 
the net interest margin has been adversely impacted over a protracted period of time during which the overall shape of the yield curve was either flat or inverted 
beginning mid way in the second half of  prompted by adverse economic trends  the yield curve returned to a normal  upward slope 
the quality of the bank s loan assets  as well as growth and mix  influences earnings in part through provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
benjamin franklin bank s loan loss provision increased by  comparing the years and as asset quality was relatively unchanged from year to year  the increase in s provision in large part can be attributed to growth in commercial loan assets and a decline in residential mortgages  and the higher risk associated with this change in loan mix 
non interest income increased from million in the year to million in during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred two non recurring losses totaling million 
excluding those non recurring losses related to the designation of certain portfolio residential mortgage loans as held for sale and a branch sale leaseback transaction and approximately  in non recurring gains recorded in  non interest income increased by million or in a majority of the million increase pertained to growth in loan related fees and increased gains on sales of residential loans originated for sale 
the company s operating expenses increased by million or in the year  compared to  led by million of growth in salaries and employee benefits 
increases in commercial and retail business and product development staff  the costs of staffing two new branch locations  and increases in retirement costs and employee health benefits all contributed notably to the increase 
occupancy costs also increased by  year over year  due primarily to the onset of rental expense in a six branch sale leaseback transaction as well costs to run two new branches opened since september critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assessments by management  and which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
benjamin franklin considers the following to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
this accounting policy is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used  and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on a periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and size of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses  please refer to business asset quality in item income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
benjamin franklin uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
intangible assets 
benjamin franklin considers accounting for goodwill to be critical because significant judgment is exercised in performing periodic valuations of this asset  which arose through the acquisitions of chart bank and foxboro national bank 
goodwill is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis as of each december st  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential for impairment 
at 
table of contents the time of each acquisition  the operations of chart bank and foxboro national bank were combined with the operations of benjamin franklin based on similar economic characteristics 
accordingly  discrete financial information is not separately maintained to evaluate the operating results of the former chart bank and foxboro national bank and  as a result  in performing a goodwill impairment evaluation  benjamin franklin measures the fair value of the entire company  rather than that of each of the acquired banks 
if impairment is detected  the carrying value of goodwill is reduced through a charge to earnings 
the evaluation of goodwill involves estimations of discount rates and the timing of projected future cash flows  which are subject to change with changes in economic conditions and other factors 
such changes in the assumptions used to evaluate this intangible asset affect its value and could have a material adverse impact on benjamin franklin s results of operations 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that management considers to be critical  however all accounting policies are important  and therefore the reader is encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements to gain a better understanding of how benjamin franklin s financial performance is measured and reported

total assets decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decline was primarily the result of the disposition of million of loans held for sale at year end  largely offset by growth in the commercial loan and securities portfolios 
cash and short term investments 
cash balances  comprised of million in cash and correspondent bank balances and million in cash supplied to atms owned by independent service organizations isos  decreased by million to million as of december  when compared to december  this result is the net of a million decline in cash and correspondent bank balances  offset in part by an increase of million in cash supplied to atms owned by isos 
short term investments  comprised of overnight federal funds sold million  repurchase agreements million  and money market funds million  decreased million to million at december  the lower level of short term investments at period end was the result of ordinary fluctuations in the bank s short term liquidity accounts 
securities 
the securities portfolio totaled million at december   an increase of  or million  from million at december  the portfolio represented of total assets at december   compared to a year earlier 
during  government sponsored enterprise gse obligations decreased by million  while the mortgage backed securities portfolio increased by million 
in the first quarter of  the bank completed a sale of residential mortgage loans associated with the million of loans classified as held for sale at december  that netted million of cash proceeds 
management chose to reinvest million of the loan sale proceeds into gse obligations  and million into pass through mortgage backed securities sponsored by government agencies  including million of fixed rate securities and million of adjustable rate securities 
total purchase volume of pass through mortgage backed securities in was million 
the net decline of million in gse 
table of contents obligations in the year included the sale of million of available for sale gse obligations  which generated capital gains of  nearly all of the bonds sold were callable securities  at risk of being called within one year at the time of sale 
the securities portfolio carried net unrealized losses of million at december   compared to million of net unrealized losses at december  the primary reason for the decrease in the net unrealized loss was downward shifts in the level of market interest rates in late  particularly in the short to intermediate portion of the yield curve 
net loans 
net loans as of december  were million  an increase of million  or  over net loan balances of million excluding loans held for sale as of december  net loans represented of total assets at december   compared to a year prior

commercial loans increased by million  or  year over year  and represented of total loans at december   compared to of total loans at december  commercial loan categories with year over year increases included commercial real estate up million and commercial business up million  while construction loans decreased by million

the residential mortgage portfolio excluding loans held for sale decreased by million  or  during the year  and represented of total loans at december   compared to at the end of the prior year 
the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio can be attributed both to the company s loan sales preferences  as well as a general slowdown in the local residential loan market 
the bank s general strategy of retaining adjustable rate mortgages in portfolio while selling fixed rate originations into the secondary market contributed to the decline in loan balances in  as adjustable rate borrowers were active in refinancing their loans  typically into fixed rate mortgages 
however  in late  spreads widened compared to funding costs for both conforming and jumbo residential fixed rate loans  and as a result  the company is currently holding much of its recent fixed rate production in portfolio 
this practice is expected to increase net interest income over time  but will have the more immediate effect of reducing gains realized on loans sold 
consumer loans consist predominantly of home equity loans including term loans and lines of credit  although the bank also offers automobile  savings secured  and other types of consumer loans

demand accounts and savings accounts decreased by million and million  respectively  over the twelve months ended december  unlike many competing institutions throughout the industry that struggled in to grow their core deposits  the company experienced some success in generating new core deposit accounts  largely due to the introduction of two products in the sector

in addition  the bank introduced a new retail now account in the first quarter of that totaled million in account balances at the end of the year 
while the bank pays a competitive rate of interest on both products  management anticipates that the transactional features of the accounts will strengthen the relationships formed with many of these new customers  over time 
growth in core account balances  as well as increasingly attractive rates on term advances offered by the federal home loan bank late in the year  allowed management the flexibility to lower its offering rates on certificates of deposits  leading to a million decline in time accounts in certificates of deposit represented of total deposits at the end of  compared to at the end of the company consistently evaluates all of its deposit and borrowing funding sources for the most attractive mix in funding its asset base

an increase of basis points  year over year  in the yield on loans explains of the total million increase in interest income 
the increase can be attributed to higher interest rates that persisted for much of as well as changes in loan mix toward higher yielding commercial loans 
a sizable proportion of the company s loan assets are adjustable rate  and rate resets typically were higher throughout the year 
in addition  the mix of average loans changed significantly during the year toward higher yielding assets  as commercial loans comprised of average loans for the year  compared to in  while mortgage loans comprised and of average loans for the years and  respectively

net gains losses from these sales including valuation write downs prior to sale were  and million for and  respectively 
excluding these sale transactions  non interest income increased by million  or 

table of contents the following chart itemizes the sale transactions impact on non interest income in and to approximate normalized operating results 
several of these transactions are described more fully following the chart change dollars in thousands reported non interest income less write down of loans transferred to held for sale gain loss on sale of premises gain on sale of cssi customer list normalized non interest income in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a pre tax loss of million upon the designation of million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans as held for sale 
the loss recognized was attributable to the increase in market interest rates since the loans were originated  and no credit issues were associated with these loans

in december  the company sold and simultaneously leased back six of its branch locations 
the total purchase price for the six branches was million 
the gain recognized on five of the branches in the sale million was deferred and is being recognized ratably over the initial lease term of years 
however  a net loss on the sale of one branch  totaling  was recognized as an immediate reduction of non interest income 
in may  the bank and its subsidiary creative strategic solutions  inc cssi  entered into an agreement to sell certain of cssi s assets principally its customer list and rights and obligations under its customer contracts to another bank with an atm servicing division 
as part of the agreement  the company collected  in two installment payments from the other bank 
if former cssi customer balances and rates remain at levels outstanding at the closing of the transaction million  the bank has the opportunity to earn two additional payments aggregating  however  because the prime rate of interest has fallen since the transaction closed  it is likely that the total of any future payments will be less than that amount 
excluding the asset sale transactions listed above  non interest income increased by million  or  comparing to categories with significant increases year over year included other loan related fees up  or  gains on loans originated for sale up  or  and gains on trading assets up 
the increase in loan related fees can be attributed primarily to two causes 
during  the company collected  of prepayment penalties from commercial borrowers who paid off or refinanced their loans earlier than contracted for  approximately  higher than the total 
in addition  loan servicing fees  net of the amortization of mortgage servicing rights  increased by  or year over year  largely due to the addition of million of serviced loans from the bulk loan sale in the first quarter of gains on loans originated for sale in include  in gains for a new reverse mortgage product that did not exist in  the remaining year over year increase of  correlates with increased volume of conventional fixed rate loans sold into the secondary market 
excluding reverse mortgages and the bulk loan sale  the volume of loans sold into the secondary market increased by million or year over year 
gains on trading assets reflect the difference between the purchase amount and sales proceeds of a million mutual fund asset that the company held in for approximately five months 
atm servicing fees decreased by  or  from to  representing the only non interest income category with a year over year decline 
from january through april of  cssi earned fees by providing cash to atms owned by isos nationwide 
fees were collected from the isos for managing the atms and for the use of the cash in the machines 
on may   the bank and cssi entered into an agreement to sell certain of cssi s assets principally its customer list and rights and obligations under its customer contracts to another bank with an atm servicing division 
as part of this transaction  the bank 
table of contents retained the right to continue to supply atm cash to its former customers  for a minimum of months 
the bank continues to earn fees under this arrangement  but those fees are lower  since the bank no longer provides full administrative and operational support for these customers 
the fees charged for the use of the atm cash are assessed using a formula based on the prime rate of interest  and will vary directly over time with changes in the prime rate 
the average yield fee income divided by average cash outstanding earned in was compared to earned in the decline in average rate is attributable primarily to reduced pricing commensurate with the transfer of operational risk and responsibility to the other bank  and to a lesser degree  a basis point decline in the prime rate of interest during the second half of non interest expense 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  when compared to million incurred during the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits expenses represented the largest increase in non interest expense in comparing the years and  growing by million  or  to a total of million

the company also entered into a strategic alliance with a small investment services firm in may  assuming its sales staff and sales support costs 
incentives and commissions increased pursuant to the successful achievement by line personnel of annual business generation goals  particularly for core deposits and loans 
in addition to these base compensation costs  stock incentive plan awards resulted in  of expense over five months in  and million for the full twelve months in increases in retirement plan costs and health insurance benefits also contributed to the overall increase  rising by  year over year 
management took certain steps mid way during to curb growth in salaries  including the elimination of staff positions seven of those at cssi  which is now an inactive subsidiary  and in january instituted less expensive medical insurance and k match programs 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased year over year by  or  totaling million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to the onset of rental expense in the six branch sale leaseback transaction in december  as well as new leases for the two branches opened in wellesley and watertown 
the final category of expense exhibiting an increase year over year in was data processing costs  up  or 
the increase in data processing costs reflects company growth  including development  support and management costs for several new product offerings  and increases in the company s branch and atm network 
expense groupings experiencing year over year declines in included professional fees down  or amortization of intangible assets down  or and marketing and advertising down  or 
the decrease in professional fees arose primarily from a  decline in audit and examination fees and a  decline in consulting fees 
audit fees were abnormally high in the year  primarily due to first year compliance with certain sarbanes oxley act requirements 
the company augmented its internal audit staffing in to help defray costs incurred for outsourced audit assistance 
consulting fees dropped pursuant to the termination of certain contracts related to the cssi operation in the second quarter of  and the lapse of other contracts related to the chart bank merger in the second quarter of the company incurred non cash charges of  for the amortization of intangible assets in   less than the comparable period in a core deposit intangible asset was created in the chart bank acquisition and is being amortized into expense using an accelerated method

the company reduced its effective tax rate below applicable statutory rates  in part  through recognition of capital 
table of contents gains that allowed the use of a capital loss carryover  the tax benefit of which was unrecorded 
the effective tax rate was also reduced by recording higher proportional amounts of taxable income in its securities corporations  which bear lower statutory rates for state income tax purposes 
the income tax benefit recorded in reflected a million tax benefit related to the sale and simultaneous leaseback of six of the company s branch locations 
the positive effect of this transaction on earnings was primarily due to the capital gain generated by the transaction  which allowed the bank to use a capital loss carryover  the tax benefit of which was previously unrecorded and would have expired on december  comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets 
total assets increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this growth was largely the result of an increase in the loan portfolio including loans held for sale  supplemented by smaller increases in cash and cash equivalents and securities

for information concerning the allowance for loan losses at december  and  refer to asset quality allowance for loan losses 
loans held for sale 
in december  the company committed to sell million of lower yielding adjustable rate mortgage loans  in order to help improve its net interest margin in upcoming years 
these mortgages were originated for retention in the loan portfolio  in prior years 
the loss recorded on the transfer to held for sale was million  or approximately of the gross book value of the loans 
the 
table of contents loss recognized was attributable to the increase in market interest rates since the loans were originated  and no credit issues were associated with these loans 
proceeds from the sales were received in february  deposits 
deposits increased by million to million at december   an increase of over a total of million at december  certificates of deposit increased by million  or  year over year 
all other deposit categories decreased by a combined million or  during the year  with the largest declines in regular and other savings million  demand accounts million  and now accounts million 
similar to many other competitors in its market area  the company experienced a shift in deposit mix during the years and  as deposit customers displayed a marked preference for certificates of deposit as compared to other interest bearing deposit products  such as savings  now  or money market accounts 
as short term interest rates rose and stabilized at higher levels in  customers were considerably more aggressive in seeking competitive market yields for their deposit dollars 
the company has strived to respond with competitive products in order to meet the challenges of funding the bank with the deposits it needs to expand 
in  the company introduced a new line of cash management products to its business customers and introduced new checking and health savings account products to retail customers in the first half of borrowed funds

the bank took out new borrowings  in substance  to fund net loan growth 
the million balance in subordinated debt was unchanged during stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity was million as of december   an increase of million compared to million at december  the primary components of the net increase was net income of million  net of million of dividends paid to shareholders and the repurchase of million in common stock 
in addition  stockholders equity increased in from the amortization of  in unearned compensation 
comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  a million increase over the  in net income for the year this increase in net income was largely attributable to million of growth in net interest income  million of growth in recurring sources of other income  and a million income tax benefit derived from the utilization of a tax loss carryover 
while the company s net interest margin declined during  the full twelve month impact of the april chart bank merger contributed favorably to the improvement in operating earnings 
in addition  operating expenses declined by million year over year  after factoring in a one time million pre tax contribution to the benjamin franklin bank charitable foundation in the second quarter of net interest income 
net interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets  offset by a basis point decline or in the net interest margin 
the increase in interest earning assets was due primarily to million of growth  on average  in the loan portfolio  supplemented by a net combined increase of million in average securities and short term investments 
these year over year increases are partially attributable to the full year effect in of the chart bank merger  whereby million of interest earning assets  including million in net loans  were acquired on april  the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points year over year  due mainly to an increase in market interest rates 
average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  growth in average interest bearing liabilities included million in deposits and million in 
table of contents borrowings 
these year over year increases are partially attributable to the full year effect in of the chart bank merger whereby million in deposits and million of borrowed funds were added to the company s balance sheet on april  rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points during  including basis points on deposits and basis points on borrowings 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to million earned in the prior year 
the overall increase in interest income resulted from both a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets  and a basis point  or  increase in the yield on those assets 
approximately of the dollar increase in interest income is explainable by an increase of million in average loans outstanding  year over year  and approximately is explainable by a basis point increase in the yield on loans 
the increase in the loan yield of basis points was due to increases in market interest rates  the full year inclusion in of the acquired chart bank loan portfolio  and to internally generated growth in higher yielding commercial loans 
during  the average balance of securities increased by million  while the average balance of short term investments declined by million 
increases in yields earned on securities and short term investments of basis points and basis points  respectively  were due mainly to the increase in market interest rates during the last two years 
in and  the company s security portfolio was comprised largely of laddered maturities of government sponsored enterprise obligations  which provided the company a regular source of liquidity and re priced upwards as those maturities were replaced with like bonds at current interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense arose from both an million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities  and an basis point  or  increase in the cost of those liabilities 
the million increase in average interest bearing liabilities was caused partially by the full year impact in of the chart bank acquisition  which added million to the company s funding liabilities including non interest bearing demand deposits on april  overall  average interest bearing deposits increased million year over year  while borrowed funds increased by million 
a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits during the year was due in large part to the increase in market interest rates  and a persistent tendency  throughout the year  for customers to choose cds as compared to other types of deposits 
with gradually rising market interest rates  particularly in the first nine months of  the company and other financial institutions in its market area responded to customer demand by increasing their rates paid on cd accounts 
within the company s deposit portfolio  the average balance of cds increased by million year over year  while the other interest bearing deposit categories  generally referred to as core deposits  decreased by a combined million 
outside of cds and money market accounts  the company was generally able to refrain from raising its deposit rates in the overall rate paid on money market accounts increased by basis points  year over year  as the company created new higher paying products in that generated million of account balances at year end 
the company increased its borrowings level  on average  by million in primarily in order to assist in funding loan growth 
the company often takes out medium term or longer term fhlb borrowings for asset liability management purposes  especially since customer demand for cds is predominantly for terms of shorter lengths of time 
the cost of borrowed funds increased by basis points year over year  reflecting higher market interest rates on marginal new business 
provision for loan losses 
the company records a provision for loan losses as a charge to its earnings when necessary in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
refer to business asset quality for additional information about the company s methodology for establishing its allowance for loan losses 
loan loss provisions were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
provisions in both years were primarily reflective of growth in the loan portfolio  as net charge offs recoveries in both years were 
table of contents nominal 
the company s provision was reduced by  in pursuant to the transfer of million of residential mortgages to loans held for sale 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans  compared to million  or  of total loans at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of commercial loans in the portfolio 
in  the company reclassified the reserve for unfunded lending commitments from the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities for all years presented 
the provision for unfunded lending commitments formerly included in the provision for loan losses has been reclassified to non interest expense for all years presented 
non interest income 
non interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or  when compared to the year ended december  during and  the company engaged in several transactions involving bank owned premises including branches and real estate held as future branch sites and portfolio loan sales 
net losses from these sales including valuation write downs prior to sale were million and million for and  respectively 
excluding these sale transactions  non interest income increased by million  or  year over year 
the following chart itemizes the sale transactions impact on non interest income in the years and to approximate normalized operating results 
each transaction is described more fully following the chart change dollars in thousands reported non interest income less write down of loans transferred to held for sale gain loss on sale of premises write down of premises normalized non interest income in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a pre tax loss of million upon the designation of million of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans as held for sale 
the transaction was part of a balance sheet restructure that is expected to increase interest income in upcoming years 
the loss recognized was attributable to the increase in market interest rates since the loans were originated  and no credit issues were associated with these loans 
these loans  which bore below market interest rates  were sold in the first quarter of in december  the company sold and simultaneously leased back six of its branch locations 
the total purchase price for the six branches was million 
the gain recognized on five of the branches in the sale million was deferred and will be recognized ratably over the initial lease term of years 
however  a net loss on the sale of one branch  totaling  was recognized as a reduction of non interest income immediately 
during the second quarter of  two parcels of land that had been held as future branch sites were sold for an aggregate gain of  a third parcel that had been held as a future branch site was written down by million to its estimated net fair market value  once the decision was made by the company to market the parcel for sale 
this parcel was sold in the first quarter of at a gain of excluding the asset sale transactions  non interest income increased by million  or  during the year approximately of this increase  or million  was from higher atm servicing fees  generated by subsidiary cssi 
during and  cssi provided cash to atms owned by isos nationwide  and collected fees from the isos for managing the atms and for the use of the cash in the machines 
other revenue increases year over year included deposit service fees  or  income from bank owned life insurance  or and miscellaneous income  or 
growth in fees earned on deposit accounts and miscellaneous income was mainly the result of the addition of the 
table of contents chart bank deposit accounts and branch locations 
the increase in income on bank owned life insurance was due primarily to an additional million investment made early in income from the sale of non deposit investment products decreased by  or  when comparing the year to the year non interest expense 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  when compared to million incurred during the year ended december  results included a million contribution made in april to the benjamin franklin bank charitable foundation 
the company has no intention of making future contributions to the foundation 
excluding the contribution  the increase in non interest expenses in compared to would have been million  or non interest expenses  excluding the contribution  increased year over year due in part to the full year impact of investments made during the course of  including the acquisition of chart bank  expansion of the company s lending capabilities and the stock conversion  which brought new personnel  investor relations  audit and legal costs associated with operating a larger  and public company 
the largest year over year increase in non interest expense was in employee salaries and benefits expenses  which increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  in addition to a  or  increase in base salaries  bonuses  and commissions  the company instituted new stock incentive plans in august that resulted in  of expense 
staffing levels increased due to the opening of a new branch office in wellesley  as well as in certain sales and administrative functions 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to the addition of costs associated with chart bank s office locations  as well as the new branch in wellesley 
a year over year increase in data processing costs  or largely reflects the growth of the company and development and support costs for new product offerings 
professional fees increased  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a  increase in audit and examination fees  brought about by the conversion to a public company in and compliance with sarbanes oxley act requirements 
the company incurred non cash charges of million for the amortization of core deposit intangible assets in   less than the comparable period in the core deposit intangible was created in the chart bank acquisition and is being amortized into expense using an accelerated method 
general and administrative expenses also increased year over year by  or  due largely to the full year effect of adding chart bank and cssi operations  as well as overall company growth 
larger year over year increases in other general and administrative expenses included insurance premiums  postage and supplies  correspondent bank charges  and directors fees 
directors fees increased with the addition of six new board members from chart bank and the mid year implementation in of a retirement plan for directors 
income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  from the million in expense recorded for the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the and years were and  respectively 
the high effective tax rate in the year was primarily a function of the bank owned land transactions 
no tax benefit was recognized on the million net loss on sale write down of bank owned land 
the income tax benefit recorded in reflected a million tax benefit related to the sale and simultaneous leaseback of six of the company s branch locations 
the total purchase price of the six branches was million 
the positive effect of this transaction on earnings is primarily due to the capital gain generated by the transaction  which allowed the bank to use a capital loss carryover  the tax benefit of which was previously unrecorded and would have expired on december

 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value 
this statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability  that is  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
emphasis is placed on fair value being a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and therefore a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering these market participant assumptions  a fair value hierarchy has been established to distinguish between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
this statement is effective for the company on january  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with the objective of improving financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions  and is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement 
an entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date

this replaces the cost allocation process under statement no 
 which resulted in the non recognition of some assets and liabilities at the acquisition date and in measuring some assets and liabilities at amounts other than their fair values at the acquisition date 
this statement requires that acquisition costs and expected restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition  and that the acquirer in a business combination achieved in 
table of contents stages recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as the non controlling interest in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
this statement also requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  while statement allowed for the deferred recognition of pre acquisition contingencies until certain recognition criteria were met  and an acquirer is only required to recognize assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability 
under this statement  an acquirer is required to recognize contingent consideration at the acquisition date  whereas contingent consideration obligations usually were not recognized at the acquisition date under statement further  this statement eliminates the concept of negative goodwill and requires gain recognition in instances in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non controlling interest in the acquiree

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management and the board of directors of benjamin franklin recognize that taking and managing risk is fundamental to the business of banking 
through the development  implementation and monitoring of its policies with respect to risk management  the company strives to measure  evaluate and control the risks it faces 
the board and management understand that an effective risk management system is critical to the company s safety and soundness 
chief among the risks faced by benjamin franklin are credit risk  market risk including interest rate risk  liquidity risk  operational transaction risk and compliance risk 
within management  the responsibility for risk management rests with the risk management committee  chaired by the svp risk management officer 
other members of the committee include the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  controller  and the senior officers responsible for lending  retail banking and human resources 
the risk management committee meets on a monthly basis to review the status of the company s risk management efforts  including reviews of internal and external audit findings  loan review findings  and the activities of the asset liability committee with respect to monitoring interest rate and liquidity risk 
the committee tracks any open items requiring corrective action with the goal of ensuring that each is addressed on a timely basis 
the compliance and risk management officer reports all findings of the risk management committee directly to the board s audit and risk management committee 
management of credit risk 
benjamin franklin considers credit risk to be the most significant risk it faces  in that it has the greatest potential to affect the financial condition and operating results of the bank 
credit risk is managed through a combination of policies established by the board  the monitoring of compliance with these policies  and the periodic evaluation of loans in the portfolio  including those with problem characteristics 
in general  benjamin franklin s policies establish maximums on the amount of credit that may be granted to a single borrower including affiliates  the aggregate amount of loans outstanding by type in relation to total assets and capital  and loan concentrations 
collateral and debt service coverage ratios  approval limits and other underwriting criteria are also specified 
policies also exist with respect to performing periodic credit reviews  the rating of loans  when loans should be placed on non performing status and factors that should be considered in establishing the bank s allowance for loan losses 
for additional information  refer to business lending activities 
management of market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates  and typically encompasses exposures such as sensitivity to changes in market interest rates  foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
benjamin franklin has no exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodity price movements 
because net interest income is benjamin franklin s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is a significant market risk to which the bank is exposed 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of future net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as by fluctuations in the level  mix and duration of the company s assets and liabilities 
over and above the influence that interest rates have on net interest income  changes in rates may also affect the volume of lending activity  the ability of borrowers to repay loans  the volume of loan prepayments  the flow and mix of deposits  and the market value of the bank s assets and liabilities 
benjamin franklin s asset liability committee alco  comprised of several members of senior and middle management  is responsible for managing the company s interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors 
the alco is charged with managing assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with benjamin franklin s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
on a quarterly basis  the committee reviews with the board of directors its analysis of the bank s exposure to interest rate risk and the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the bank s future net interest income  and by implication its business strategies 
the committee is also actively involved in the bank s planning and budgeting process as well as in determining pricing strategies for deposits and loans 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by benjamin franklin through periodic evaluations of the current interest rate risk inherent in its rate sensitive assets and liabilities  coupled with determinations of the level of risk considered appropriate given the bank s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  and performance objectives 
through such management  benjamin franklin seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the alco s primary tool for measuring  evaluating  and managing interest rate risk is income simulation analysis 
income simulation analysis measures interest rate risk inherent in the company s balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over defined time horizons 
these simulations take into account the specific repricing  maturity  prepayment and call options of financial instruments that vary under different interest rate scenarios 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the exposure to a decline in net interest income remains within established tolerance levels over the simulation horizons and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
benjamin franklin uses instantaneous rate shocks compared against static or flat rates when measuring interest rate risk  and evaluates results over both a twelve month and a thirteen to month period 
all changes are measured in comparison to the projected net interest income that would result from an unchanged scenario  where both interest rates and the composition of the balance sheet remain stable over the measured horizon s 
as of december   the income simulation analysis as noted in the table below for the first twelve month period indicated that exposure to changing interest rates fell within the company s policy levels of tolerance 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure they are reasonable  and back tests simulation results on a periodic basis as a monitoring tool  income simulation analysis may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of the company s interest rate risk or future earnings 
there are inherent shortcomings in income simulation  given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made to perform it 
for example  the projected level of future market interest rates and the shape of future interest rate yield curves have a major impact on income simulation results 
many assumptions concerning the repricing of financial instruments  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  and the expected prepayment rates on loans  mortgage backed securities  and callable bonds are also inherently uncertain 
in addition  as income simulation analysis assumes that the company s balance sheet will remain static over the simulation horizon  the results do not reflect the company s expectations for future balance sheet growth  nor changes in business strategy that the company could implement in response to rate shifts to mitigate its loss exposures 
as such  although the analysis described above provides an indication of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time  these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise 
table of contents forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the estimated changes in net interest income over the next twelve months comparing an unchanged rate scenario to projected results using various parallel shifts in market interest rates 
these computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual future results 
percentage change in estimated net interest income over months basis point increase in rates basis point increase in rates basis point increase in rates flat interest rates basis point decrease in rates basis point decrease in rates the company s income simulation analysis contains important assumptions regarding the rate sensitivity of interest bearing core deposit accounts 
for example  the company assumes that money market account rates would change by basis points for each basis point change in market interest rates 
these scenarios also assume no change in regular savings and regular now account interest rates 
interest rates for certain premium rate now and money market savings accounts are expected to vary to the full extent of any increase or decrease in market interest rates 
in addition  deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate floors below which rates will not fall 
these assumptions are based on the bank s past experience with the changes in rates paid on these non maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates 
there can be no assurance that the core deposit pricing assumptions used in the simulation analysis will actually occur 
as indicated in the table above  the result of an immediate basis point parallel increase in interest rates is estimated to decrease net interest income by over a month horizon  when compared to the unchanged rate scenario 
for an immediate basis point parallel increase in the level of interest rates  net interest income is estimated to decrease by over a month horizon  when compared against the unchanged rate scenario 
the exposure of net interest income to rising rates as compared to an unchanged rate scenario results from the difference between anticipated increases in asset yields and somewhat more rapid increases in funding costs 
the company assumes that certain premium rate now and money market deposit products  that demonstrated strong growth in and comprise a larger proportion of interest bearing deposits  bear full sensitivity to increases in market rates for simulation purposes 
the estimated change in net interest income over a month horizon from the unchanged rate scenario for a basis point parallel decline in the level of interest rates is an increase of 
for an immediate basis point parallel decrease in the level of interest rates  net interest income is estimated to decrease by over a month horizon  when compared against the unchanged rate scenario 
a modest decrease of basis points from an unchanged rate scenario would likely result in a favorable change in net interest income over the next months  as funding costs are projected to decrease farther than asset yields 
however  in the basis point decrease rate scenario  the projected drop in net interest income as compared to an unchanged rate scenario results from a more rapid decline in earning asset yields compared to rates paid on funding liabilities 
if rates were to fall by basis points  rate floors on most core deposit accounts would come into effect for simulation purposes 
in addition  asset yields would decline more than funding costs as cash flow from prepayments of mortgage related products  and redemption of callable securities  would increase significantly as market rates fall  exposing the company to higher re investment risk 
management of liquidity risk 
the risk to earnings and capital arising from an organization s inability to meet its obligations without incurring unacceptable losses is defined as liquidity risk 
the treasurer of the company is responsible for monitoring the adequacy of benjamin franklin s liquidity position on a daily basis 
the company actively manages its liquidity position under the direction of the asset liability committee 
the board of directors provides oversight on no less than a monthly basis  as well 

table of contents liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
benjamin franklin uses its liquidity on a regular basis to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and borrowings  to fund other deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to make dividend payments to shareholders  and to meet operating expenses 
in addition  the company has used funds since early to repurchase its common stock see item c repurchase of equity securities for further information 
benjamin franklin s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  borrowed funds  and the amortization  prepayment and maturities of loans and securities 
while scheduled payments from the amortization and maturities of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and investment prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition to these regular sources of funds  the company may choose to sell portfolio loans and investment securities to meet liquidity demands 
however  it is the bank s general practice to hold loan originations and investment securities until their final maturity 
at december   cash and due from banks excluding cash supplied to atm customers  short term investments  and debt securities maturing within one year totaled million or of total assets 
at december   these totals were million  or of total assets 
management believes that the company has adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands 
benjamin franklin utilizes borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb as a source of funds 
wholesale borrowing may be considered attractive from an earnings perspective when it may be done at a cost advantage to raising deposits in the local market area 
fhlb borrowing may also be used to extend or shorten liability maturities when the deposit customers choice of maturities is not consistent with the company s overall desired position for interest rate risk purposes or due to anticipated economic conditions 
at december   based on qualifying collateral calculations as promulgated by the fhlbb  the company has access to approximately million of additional borrowing capacity 
since december   the company has increased its fhlbb borrowings by million  to a total of million outstanding as of december  the following tables present information indicating various contractual obligations and commitments of the company as of the dates indicated and the respective maturity dates contractual obligations at december  more than more than one year three years one year through through over five total or less three years five years years dollars in thousands federal home loan bank advances operating leases non qualified pension other contractual obligations total contractual obligations secured under a blanket security agreement on qualifying assets  principally family residential mortgage loans

unused portions of construction loans are available to the borrower for up to years for development loans and up to year for other construction loans 
unused portion of checking overdraft lines of credit are available to customers in good standing indefinitely 
management of other risks 
two additional risk areas that receive significant attention by management and the board are operational risk and compliance risk
