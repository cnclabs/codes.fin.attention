item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included throughout this report 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  including statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are  or may be deemed to be  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of as discussed below  the financial statements  footnotes  schedules and discussion within this report have been reformatted to conform to the presentation required for discontinued operations pursuant to the company s sale of its mortgage banking subsidiary in august executive overview first community bancshares  inc is a bank holding company that  through its bank subsidiary  provides commercial banking services and has positioned itself as a regional community bank and a financial services alternative to larger banks which often provide less emphasis on personal relationships  and smaller community banks which lack the capital and resources to efficiently serve customer needs 
the company has focused its growth efforts on building financial partnerships and more enduring and complete relationships with businesses and individuals through a very personal approach to banking and financial services 
the company and its operations are guided by a strategic plan which includes growth through acquisitions and through office expansion in new market areas including strategically identified metro markets in virginia  west virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and tennessee 
while the company s mission remains that of a community bank  management believes that entry into new markets will accelerate the company s growth rate by diversifying the demographics of its customer base and customer prospects and by generally increasing its sales and service network 
economy the local economies in which the company operates are diverse and span a five state region 
west virginia and southwest virginia continue to benefit from increasing coal and natural gas prices 
these economies have significant exposure to extractive industries  such as coal and natural gas  which become more active and lucrative when oil prices rise 
the local economies in the central portion of north carolina have suffered in recent years due to foreign competition in both furniture and textiles  as well as consolidation in the financial services industry 
despite these detractions  the economies in this region continue to benefit from national companies relocating and expanding in the triad and central piedmont areas 
the eastern virginia local economies are benefiting from a wide array of corporate and government activities and relocations 
the capital markets have experienced significant illiquidity in the last half of  which has had an adverse effect on the valuation of debt securities 
competitive focus as the company competes for increased market share and growth in both loans and deposits it continues to encounter strong competition from many sources 
bank expansion through de novo branches and loan production offices has grown in popularity as a means of reaching out to new markets 
many of the markets targeted by the company are also being entered by other banks in nearby markets and  in some cases  from more distant markets 
despite strong competition from other banks  credit unions and mortgage companies  the company has seen success in newly established offices in winston salem as well as other markets in both virginia and north carolina 
the company attributes this measure of success to its recruitment of local  established bankers and loan personnel in those targeted markets 
competitive forces impact the company through pressure on interest yields  product fees and loan structure and terms  however  the company has countered these pressures with its relationship style of banking  competitive pricing and a disciplined approach to loan underwriting 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of financial modeling techniques and appraisal estimates 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following is a summary of the company s more subjective and complex critical accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio  and is based on management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
the company consistently applies a review process to periodically evaluate loans for changes in credit risk 
this process serves as the primary means by which the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans that exhibit inherent weaknesses and various credit risk factors  and general allocations to commercial  residential real estate  and consumer loans are developed giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends and other relevant factors 
these factors may include  among others  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  and the impact of government regulations 
the foregoing analysis is performed by management to evaluate the portfolio and calculate an estimated valuation allowance through a quantitative and qualitative analysis that applies risk factors to those identified risk areas 
this risk management evaluation is applied at both the portfolio level and the individual loan level for commercial loans and credit relationships while the level of consumer and residential mortgage loan allowance is determined primarily on a total portfolio level based on a review of historical loss percentages and other qualitative factors including concentrations  industry specific factors and economic conditions 
the commercial portfolio requires more specific analysis of individually significant loans and the borrower s underlying cash flow  business conditions  capacity for debt repayment and the valuation of secondary sources of payment  such as collateral 
this analysis may result in specifically identified weaknesses and corresponding specific impairment allowances 
while allocations are made to specific loans and classifications within the various categories of loans  the allowance for loan losses is available for all loan losses 
the use of various estimates and judgments in the company s ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly impact the company s results of operations and financial condition and may result in either greater provisions against earnings to increase the allowance or reduced provisions based upon management s current view of portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
differences between actual loan loss experience and estimates are reflected through adjustments either increasing or decreasing the loan loss provision based upon current measurement criteria 
acquisitions and intangible assets the company may  from time to time  engage in business combinations with other companies 
the acquisition of a business is generally accounted for under purchase accounting rules promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
purchase accounting requires the recording of underlying assets and liabilities of the entity acquired at their fair market value 
any excess of the purchase price of the business over the net assets acquired and any identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
fair values are assigned based on quoted prices for similar assets  if readily available  or appraisal by qualified independent parties for relevant asset and liability categories 
financial assets and liabilities are typically valued using discount models which apply current discount rates to streams of cash flow 
all of these valuation methods require the use of assumptions which can result in alternate valuations and varying levels of goodwill and  in some cases  amortization expense or accretion income 
management must also make estimates of useful or economic lives of certain acquired assets and liabilities 
these lives are used in establishing amortization and accretion of some intangible assets and liabilities  such as the intangible associated with core deposits acquired in the acquisition of a commercial bank 
goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price  if any  over the fair value of the revalued net assets 
goodwill is tested annually in the month of november for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of the unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the company is greater than its book value  no goodwill impairment exists 
however  if the book value of the company is greater than its determined fair value  goodwill impairment may exist and further testing is required to determine the amount  if any  of the actual impairment loss 
further testing would use a discounted cash flow model applied to the anticipated stream of cash flows from operations of the business or segment being tested 
impairment testing necessarily uses estimates in the form of growth and attrition rates  anticipated rates of return  and discount rates 
these estimates have a direct bearing on the results of the impairment testing and serve as the basis for management s conclusions as to impairment 
income taxes the establishment of provisions for federal and state income taxes is a complex area of accounting which also involves the use of judgments and estimates in applying relevant tax statutes 
the company operates in multiple state tax jurisdictions and this requires the appropriate allocation of income and expense to each state based on a variety of apportionment or allocation bases 
management strives to keep abreast of changes in tax law and the issuance of regulations which may impact tax reporting and provisions for income tax expense 
the company is also subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from company estimates and provisions 
the company continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of possible exposure based on current facts and circumstances

net interest income the primary source of the company s earnings is net interest income  the difference between income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
significant categories of earning assets are loans and securities while deposits and borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
for purposes of the following discussion  comparison of net interest income is performed on a tax equivalent basis  which provides a common basis for comparing yields on earning assets exempt from federal income taxes to those assets which are fully taxable see the table titled average balance sheets and net interest income analysis 
net interest income was million for  compared with million for tax equivalent net interest income totaled million for  a decrease of million from the million reported for the decrease is attributable to a thousand decrease due to volume and a million decrease due to rate changes on the underlying assets and liabilities 
during  average earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million  in each case over the comparable period 
the yield on average earning assets decreased three basis points to for from for short term market interest rates were very stable from august through july that stability positively impacted the rate earned on loans and securities  as new loan production and new securities purchased through september were being added at rates generally higher than those added in during  the last four months of  the federal reserve s target federal funds rate was decreased basis points  and the average bank prime loan rate decreased in concert 
those decreases were the largest driver in the overall decrease in the company s yield on average earning assets 
total cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during the company s time deposit portfolio experienced significant upward repricing during  as many of the certificates written in a lower market rate environment matured and then repriced at a higher interest rate 
the net result was a decrease of basis points to net interest rate spread  or the difference between interest income on earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
spread for was compared with for the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for represents a decrease of basis points from in loan interest income decreased million during as compared with as volume declined  while the yield on loans increased seven basis points 
during  the tax equivalent yield on available for sale securities increased basis points to while the average balance increased by million as compared with the average tax equivalent yield increased due to the addition of higher rate securities and the sales  maturities  and calls of lower rate securities 
average interest bearing balances with banks declined million during to million  while the yield increased basis points to 
these balances include overnight liquidity and a small portfolio of time deposits purchased in the yield on these balances is largely affected by changes in the target federal funds rate

the average total cost of interest bearing deposits rose basis points in compared with the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits decreased one basis point  while the average rate paid on savings  which includes money market and savings accounts  increased basis points 
the company was successful in keeping rates paid on interest bearing checking accounts relatively stable and increased money market account rates to remain competitive and retain deposit funding 
in  average time deposits decreased million while the average rate paid increased basis points to as compared with the level of average non interest bearing demand deposits decreased million to million in compared with the prior year 
average federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased million in  due mostly to increases in the balances of repurchase agreements 
the average rate paid on those funds also increased  as they are closely tied to the target federal funds rate and month libor 
average federal home loan bank fhlb advances increased million while the rate paid on those borrowings increased one basis point in other borrowings remained steady in  but the rate paid increased basis points because the majority of such borrowings consist of the company s trust preferred borrowing  which is indexed to month libor

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for was thousand  a decrease of million when compared with the decrease in loan loss provision between the periods is primarily attributable to changes in specific allocations  decreases in commercial and consumer installment loan volume  reductions in net charge offs  overall improved asset quality  and changes in various qualitative risk factors 
net charge offs for and were million and million  respectively 
expressed as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs decreased to for from in noninterest income noninterest income consists of all revenues which are not included in interest and fee income related to earning assets 
noninterest income for was million compared with million in wealth management income  which includes fees for trust services and commission and fee income generated by ipc  increased million in compared with  largely a result of the november acquisition of ipc 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million as a result of increased overdraft fees and a larger number of fee based deposit accounts 
other service charges  commissions and fees reflected an increase of thousand in compared with  due mainly to increased debit card interchange income and atm service fees 
the company acquired its insurance subsidiary  greenpoint insurance group  inc  in september essentially all income for the insurance subsidiary is derived from commissions earned on the sale of policies 
since acquisition  commissions earned on the sale of policies by greenpoint in were million 
other operating income for includes a gain of thousand resulting from the company s departure from a state banking association insurance operation 
the company was contractually required to exit the operation upon acquisition of greenpoint 
other operating income for includes million in gains from the sale of branch locations  as well as a thousand recovery relating to a payment system fraud loss 
the remaining components of other operating income increased thousand compared with during  the company also recognized securities gains of thousand  an increase of thousand over gains recognized in noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million for  an increase of thousand over salaries and benefits decreased approximately million due to the company s efforts on expense control and efficiency and the implementation of a branch staffing model 
during  total full time equivalent employees decreased to from at december  full time equivalent employees are calculated using the number of hours worked 
greenpoint accounted for approximately full time equivalent employees at year end 
total full time equivalent employees at the bank and ipc decreased by compared with occupancy expenses increased thousand compared with  as the company opened new branches and acquired greenpoint 
furniture and equipment expenses decreased thousand  due mainly to a thousand decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from to all other operating expense accounts increased million in compared with contributing to the increase is in operating expenses were increased new account promotions of thousand and consulting expense of thousand 
in  service fees related to clearing costs for ipc also increased thousand compared with and reflecting the full year impact in professional fees also increased thousand in compared with as the company outsourced its internal audit function near mid year the company uses an efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes this ratio better focuses attention on the core operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap based ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing noninterest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the reader is cautioned that the efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  the efficiency ratio used by the company is noninterest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income 
noninterest expenses used in the calculation exclude amortization of intangibles and non recurring expenses 
income for the ratio is increased for the favorable effect of tax exempt income see average balance sheets and net interest income analysis  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  and non recurring gains 
the measure is different from the gaap based efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report  which is calculated using noninterest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
both types of efficiency ratio calculations are set forth and are reconciled in the table below 
our non gaap efficiency ratios for continuing operations for   and were   and  respectively 
the following table details the components used in calculation of the efficiency ratios 
gaap based and our efficiency ratios dollars in thousands gaap based efficiency ratio noninterest expenses net interest income plus noninterest income gaap based efficiency ratio our efficiency ratio noninterest expenses gaap based less non gaap adjustments foreclosed property expense amortization of intangibles prepayment penalties on fhlb advances other non core  non recurring expense items adjusted non interest expenses net interest income plus noninterest income gaap based plus non gaap adjustment tax equivalency less non gaap adjustments security gains branch sale gains other non core  non recurring income items adjusted net interest income plus noninterest income our efficiency ratio equity based compensation on january   the company adopted the equity based compensation accounting provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r

the total after tax compensation cost related to stock option awards vesting in and was approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
income tax expense income tax expense is comprised of federal and state current and deferred income taxes on pre tax earnings of the company 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income may vary significantly from statutory rates due to items of income and expense which are excluded  by law  from the calculation of taxable income 
these items are commonly referred to as permanent differences 
the most significant permanent differences for the company include income on state and municipal securities which are exempt from federal income tax  certain dividend payments which are deductible by the company  and tax credits generated by investments in low income housing and historical building rehabilitation

the yield on average earning assets increased basis points to from for the rate earned on assets was positively impacted by the continued increases in short term market interest rates throughout total cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during  as liabilities were also affected by increases in short term market interest rates 
the net result was a decrease of basis points to net interest rate spread  or the difference between interest income on earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
spread for was compared with for the company s tax equivalent net interest margin of for was a decrease of basis points from in the largest contributor to the increase in the yield on average earning assets in  on a volume weighted basis  was a basis point increase in the rate earned on loans held for investment 
the increase in rate contributed approximately million to the million change in interest income from the portfolio 
the yield on variable rate loans tied to prime and other indices increased in response to the recent increases in short term interest rates leading the overall portfolio yield to the higher level

available for sale and held to maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
this review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the expectation for that security s performance  the creditworthiness of the issuer and the company s intent and ability to hold the security to recovery or maturity 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary would be recorded as a loss within noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income 
the company does not believe any unrealized loss  individually or in the aggregate  as of december   represents other than temporary impairment 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until such time as the value recovers or the securities mature 
furthermore  the company believes the recorded declines in the value of these securities at december  and  are attributable to changes in market interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers

the market value of held to maturity investment securities was and of book value at december  and  respectively 
recent trends in interest rates have had little effect on the portfolio market value since december   due to its larger percentage of municipal securities which display less price sensitivity to rate changes 
the average final maturity of the held to maturity investment portfolio decreased to years at december   from years at december   with the tax equivalent yield decreasing to at december   from at year end the weighted average expected maturity  based on market assumptions for prepayment  was six months and ten months at december and  respectively 
the average maturity data differs from final maturity data because of the use of assumptions as to anticipated prepayments  and is generally a more accurate indicator of true average life of the investment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of net interest income given the current interest rate environment 
the company s primary component of operational revenue  net interest income  is subject to variation as a result of changes in interest rate environments in conjunction with unbalanced repricing opportunities on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk has four primary components including repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
repricing risk occurs when earning assets and paying liabilities reprice at differing times as interest rates change 
basis risk occurs when the underlying rates on the assets and liabilities the institution holds change at different levels or in varying degrees 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences as a result of unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
lastly  option risk is the result of embedded options  often called put or call options  given or sold to holders of financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates  the company manages repricing opportunities and thus  its interest rate sensitivity 
the company seeks to control its interest rate risk irr exposure to insulate net interest income and net earnings from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
to measure its exposure to irr  quarterly simulations of net interest income are performed using financial models that project net interest income through a range of possible interest rate environments including rising  declining  most likely and flat rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations indicate the existence and severity of irr in each of those rate environments based upon the current balance sheet position  assumptions as to changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities  management s estimate of yields to be attained in those future rate environments  and rates that will be paid on various deposit instruments and borrowings 
specific strategies for management of irr have included shortening the amortized maturity of new fixed rate loans  increasing the volume of adjustable rate loans to reduce the repricing term of the bank s interest earning assets  and monitoring the term structure of liabilities to maintain a balanced mix of maturity and repricing to mitigate the potential exposure 
the simulation model used by the company captures all earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and all off balance sheet financial instruments and combines the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into an earnings outlook 
based upon the latest simulation  the company believes that it is in a neutral sensitivity position 
the company has established policy limits for tolerance of interest rate risk that allow for no more than a reduction in the next twelve months projected net interest income based on the income simulation compared with forecasted results 
in addition  the policy addresses exposure limits to changes in the economic value of equity according to predefined policy guidelines 
the most recent simulation indicates that current exposure to interest rate risk is within the company s defined policy limits 
the following table summarizes the impact of immediate and sustained rate shocks in the interest rate environment on net interest income and the economic value of equity as of december  and the model simulates plus and minus basis point changes from the base case rate simulation 
this table  which illustrates the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes  is based upon numerous assumptions including relative and estimated levels of key interest rates over a twelve month time period 
this modeling technique  although useful  does not take into account all strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock as depicted 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables
