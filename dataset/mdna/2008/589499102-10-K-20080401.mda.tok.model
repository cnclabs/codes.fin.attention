item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act  and section e of the exchange act 
we have used words such as believes  intends  anticipates  expects and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  performance  business prospects and opportunities and the timing of certain events to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  without limitation  those matters discussed in item a 
of part i of this annual report on form k 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events  developments  or changed circumstances  or for any other reason 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k and item a risk factors 
in light of the fact that our financial and liquidity positions have been deteriorating and are expected to continue to deteriorate and the concern as to whether we will be able to raise additional capital successfully and continue as a going concern  management s discussion and analysis is presented in the following order overview liquidity and capital resources revenues and expenses critical accounting policies results of operations material off balance sheet arrangements 
table of contents overview we develop medical imaging and information management software and deliver related services 
there are three business units within merge healthcare merge healthcare north america  which primarily sells directly to the end user healthcare market comprised of hospitals  imaging centers and specialty clinics located in the us and canada and also distributes certain products through the internet via our website  cedara software  our oem business unit  which primarily sells software products  developer toolkits and custom engineering services to oems and vars  comprised of companies that develop  manufacture or resell medical imaging software or devices  and merge healthcare emea  which sells to the end user healthcare market in europe  the middle east and africa 
we are currently planning to spin off the entities comprising the merge healthcare emea business unit to the local management teams 
healthcare providers continue to be challenged by declining reimbursements  competition and reduced operating profits brought about by the increasing costs of delivering healthcare services 
in the us  we are focusing our direct sales efforts on single and multi site imaging centers that complete more than  studies per year  small to medium sized hospitals fewer than beds  and certain specialty clinics like orthopedic practices that offer imaging services 
we have aggressively expanded our product offerings through our acquisitions of efilm in  ris logic in and accuimage in january  and our business combination with cedara software corp 
including its subsidiary  emed technologies  inc in june we continue to face significant business challenges from restatements of certain of our financial statements completed in and  the formal investigation being conducted by the sec  and class action and other lawsuits 
we believe that these matters have adversely affected the morale of our employees  our relationships with certain customers and potential customers  our reputation in the marketplace  and have continued to divert the attention of our board of directors and management from our business operations during although we continue to believe that the dra will ultimately be a catalyst in us end user customers moving to a filmless environment  we believe that the dra has had a larger negative impact to our target market and our net sales during than we had originally anticipated 
for a more detailed discussion of these items  see part i  item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
we have generated losses from operations over the past eight consecutive quarters 
we have undertaken certain initiatives that we anticipate will increase our revenues and decrease our costs in the future  including two separate right sizings and reorganizations  the most recent one announced in february includes personnel terminations from all parts of the organization  implementation of and significant changes to our onshore offshore global software engineering and support delivery model  and our new teleradiology services offering announced in november of however  for the year ended december   our net loss from operations amounted to million  our cash and cash equivalents has decreased from million at december  to million at december  and we currently have no credit facility 
as a result  we are currently completely dependent on available cash and operating cash flow to meet our capital needs 
we are considering all strategic options and also options for generating additional cash and revenues to fund our continuing business operations  including equity offerings  assets sales or debt financings 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we will likely not be able to fund our new teleradiology business  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  respond to competitive pressures  or continue as a going concern 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  as of december of each year 
in addition  we test an intangible asset or group for impairment between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
during the three months ended september   several material events occurred that caused us to test for impairment between annual tests 
based on the results of our impairment test  we determined that goodwill and certain intangible assets were impaired as of september  accordingly  in the three months ended september   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million and impairment charges for trade names  patents and purchased and developed software and customer relationships of million  million and million  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairment charges 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   a decrease of approximately million  or  from our balance of million at december  in addition  our working capital was million at december   a decrease of million  or  from our working capital of million at december  we anticipate that we will continue to use cash during at least the first half of as we continue to invest in our new teleradiology business and infrastructure required to grow our business 
operating cash flows cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  our negative operating cash flow in the year ended december  was primarily due to the loss from operations excluding non cash depreciation  amortization and related impairment charges of million  an other than temporary impairment on equity investments of million  share based compensation of million and a goodwill and trade name impairment charge of million  the timing of the payments for legal fees including certain settlements in connection with the class action  derivative and other lawsuits  and restructuring related payments 
we anticipate that we will pay approximately million over the next several quarters for termination benefits and related restructuring costs in connection with our restructuring initiative that we implemented during the fourth quarter of in addition  we anticipate that we will pay approximately million over the next several quarters for termination benefits and restructuring costs in connection with a new restructuring initiative that we announced on february   as more fully explained below 
we continue to incur significant legal fees in connection with the class action and other lawsuits and regulatory matters and expect to incur additional expenses until such matters are resolved 
on march   we received million from our primary directors and officers liability insurance carrier for reimbursement of legal expenses in connection with the class action and derivative action against merge healthcare and some of its current and former directors and officers 
although the amount reimbursed is only a portion of the actual insurance coverage maintained by us  it is not possible at this time to estimate how much  if any  additional funds will be collected from the insurance carriers related to these defense costs or the magnitude of the additional costs to be incurred by us in connection with the outstanding litigation and sec investigation 
investing cash flows cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   which is attributable to capitalized software development costs of million and purchases of capital equipment of million 
financing cash flows cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  resulting from employee and director stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations total outstanding commitments at december  in thousands  were as follows payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases the contractual obligations table above reflects amounts due under all our leases  including leases entered into during the year ended december  for new facilities located in atlanta  ga and pune  india 
the contractual obligations reflected above are net of sub lease income that is contractually owed to us of million in and we do not have any other significant long term obligations  contractual obligations  lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 

table of contents general we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs until at least the latter half of the second quarter of we have undertaken certain initiatives over the last months that we believe will increase our revenues and decrease our costs in the future  including our new teleradiology offering announced in november of and our ongoing cost reduction plan of both onshore employee and offshore contractor terminations 
on february   we announced the reduction in our worldwide headcount from approximately individuals at september  to approximately persons  including contracted personnel in pune  india  by march   with the vast majority of those reductions having been completed concurrent with or before the announcement 
this rightsizing initiative is designed to better align our costs with our anticipated revenues going forward and includes personnel terminations from all parts of the organization 
we anticipate that these personnel reductions and the closing of our burlington  massachusetts office will result in annual cost savings of approximately million as compared to our operating expenses for the third quarter ended september  as a result of this rightsizing initiative  we anticipate that we will recognize a charge in our financial statements for the first quarter ending march  of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in severance costs and approximately million in other costs including primarily legal fees and future lease payments on the burlington  massachusetts office  which we have completely vacated 
we are considering all strategic options and also options for generating additional cash and revenues to fund our continuing business operations  including equity offerings  assets sales or debt financings 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
furthermore  because of the low trading price of our common stock  the number of shares of the new equity or equity related securities that may be required to be issued may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  the issuance of debt securities could increase the liquidity risk or perceived liquidity risk that we face 
we cannot  however  be certain that additional financing  or funds from asset sales  will be available on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we will likely not be able to fund our new teleradiology business  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  respond to competitive pressures  or continue as a going concern 
any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in particular  our uses of cash in and beyond will depend on a variety of factors such as the extent of losses from operations  the costs to implement our business strategy  the amount of cash that we are required to devote to defend and address our outstanding legal and regulatory proceedings  and potential merger and acquisition activities 
for a more detailed description of risks and uncertainties that may affect our liquidity  see item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
revenues and expenses the following is a brief discussion of our revenues and expenses net sales net sales consist of software and other sales  net of estimated returns and allowances  and professional services and maintenance 
software and other sales consist of software and purchased component revenue recognized in sales to oem customers  healthcare facilities and imaging centers 
professional services and maintenance consists of installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and support 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of purchased components  third party royalties  costs to service and support our customers  and amortization of patents and purchased and developed software  including related impairments 
the cost of software and other includes purchased components and third party royalties included in software and hardware sales to our customers 
the cost of services and maintenance includes headcount and related costs incurred in our performance of installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and support 
purchased and developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life 
each quarter we test our purchased and developed software for impairment by comparing its fair value estimated using undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the software 
if the carrying value of the software exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment is incurred equal to the amount of the difference between the carrying value and estimated undiscounted future cash flows 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes the costs of our sales and marketing departments  commissions and costs associated with trade shows 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary software and technologies 
the costs reflected in this category are reduced by software development costs capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs and any related impairments is included in cost of sales 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense includes costs for information systems  accounting  administrative support  management personnel  bad debt expense  legal fees and general corporate matters 
acquired in process research and development in connection with our business combination with cedara software corp 
in  we incurred a charge for acquired in process research and development 
the value we assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by identifying the acquired specific in process research and development projects that would be continued  and for which technological feasibility had not been established at the transaction date  there was no alternative future use  and the fair value was estimable with reasonable reliability 
at the date of the business combination  cedara software corp 
had in process projects meeting this definition associated with the cedara next generation pacs workstation  oem imaging platforms and image acquisition console projects 
goodwill and trade name impairment  restructuring and other expenses goodwill and trade name impairment  restructuring and other expenses consist of impairment of goodwill and trade names see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein  severance to involuntarily terminated employees and impairment of non cancelable building leases associated with restructuring activities 
depreciation  amortization and impairment depreciation and amortization  including any impairment  is assessed on capital equipment  leasehold improvements and our customer relationships intangible asset 
depreciation and amortization are recorded over the respective asset s useful life 
we also record impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the assets recovery 
other income expense other income expense is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances  interest expense incurred from borrowings and foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency payables for cedara software and on foreign currency payables and receivables at our nuenen  netherlands branch and at our subsidiaries located in paris  france and shanghai  china 
in addition  we also record any more than temporary impairment charges recognized on our equity investments in non public companies in other income expense 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates  judgments  and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience  our current knowledge including terms of existing contracts  our beliefs of what could occur in the future  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  software capitalization  other long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  share based compensation expense  income taxes  guarantees and loss contingencies 

table of contents revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the licensing of software  sales of hardware and related ancillary products  installation  engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and support 
inherent to software revenue recognition are significant management estimates and judgments in the interpretation and practical application of the complex rules to individual contracts 
these interpretations generally would not influence the amount of revenue recognized  but could influence the timing of such revenues 
typically our contracts contain multiple elements  and while the majority of our contracts contain standard terms and conditions  there are instances where our contracts contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  or emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and if so  the relative fair value that should be allocated to each of the elements as well as when to recognize revenue for each element 
for software arrangements  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop no 
this generally requires revenue recognized on software arrangements involving multiple elements  including separate arrangements with the same customer executed within a short time frame of each other  to be allocated to each element based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair values of those elements 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method  pursuant to sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop no 

under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  even if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
for sales transactions where the software is incidental  the only contract deliverable is custom engineering or installation services  and hardware transactions where no software is involved  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf issue no 
and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
specifically  we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the substantive renewal price of the maintenance offered to customers  which generally is stated in the contract 
the fair value of installation  engineering services  training  and consulting is based upon the price charged when these services are sold separately 
if evidence of the fair value cannot be established for undelivered elements of a sale  the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until elements without vsoe of fair value have been delivered or vsoe of fair value can be established 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the maintenance element of a sale  and it represents the only undelivered element  the software  hardware  or software maintenance elements of the sale are deferred and recognized ratably over the lesser of the related maintenance period or the economic life of the software 
revenue from software licenses is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we must exercise our judgment when we assess the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  it could affect the timing and the amount of revenue we recognize on a contract 
in addition  in certain transactions we may negotiate that the customer provides common stock ownership in consideration as part of the sale 
we generally do not request collateral from customers 
revenue from software licenses sold through annual contracts that include software maintenance and support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue from installation  engineering services  training  and consulting services is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from sales of ris and from ris pacs solutions  and other specific arrangements where professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the solution sold  is recognized on the percentage of completion method  as prescribed by sop no 
 accounting for performance on construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion is determined by the input method based upon the amount of labor hours expended compared to the total labor hours expended plus the estimated amount of labor hours to complete the project 
total estimated labor hours are based on management s best estimate of the total amount of time it will take to complete a project 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated labor hours and reflect changes in 
table of contents estimates in the period that such estimates are revised under the cumulative catch up method 
at times  we have had difficulty accurately estimating the number of days required to complete the consulting and installation services and  accordingly  accurately estimating the percentages of completion 
our oem software products are typically fully functional upon delivery and do not require significant modification or alteration 
fees for services to oem customers are billed separately from licenses of our software products 
for sales transactions involving only the delivery of custom engineering services  we recognize revenue under proportional performance guidelines of sab no 
for certain contracts accounted for under sab no 
and eitf no 
the arrangement dictates that we invoice the customer for of the contract value of the products delivered upon completion of hardware installation and acceptance by the customer 
as a result of this specific performance obligation and acceptance criteria  we defer the related amount of product fair value and recognize it upon completion of installation and acceptance 
deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees  support and maintenance  and other services 
long term deferred revenue as of december   represents license fees  support and maintenance  and other services to be earned or provided after january  we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both services and maintenance net sales and as a direct cost of services and maintenance in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees  the reimbursement by customers of shipping and handling costs are recorded in software and other net sales and the associated cost as a cost of sale 
we account for sales taxes on a net basis in accordance with eitf no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns based upon past experience and judgment  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts with respect to our accounts receivable and sales returns 
we determine collection risk and record allowances for bad debts based on the aging of accounts and past transaction history with customers 
in addition  our policy is to allow sales returns when we have preauthorized the return 
based on our historical experience of returns and customer credits  we have determined an allowance for estimated returns and credits in accordance with fasb no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists 
we monitor our collections  write off and returns and credit experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our receivables or modifications to our credit standards  collection  return and credit  authorization practices or other related policies may impact our estimates 
software capitalization software capitalization commences when we determine that projects have achieved technological feasibility  unless the costs expected to be incurred after achieving technological feasibility until general release are immaterial 
our determination that a project has achieved technological feasibility does not ensure that the project can be commercially salable as a product 
amounts capitalized include direct labor and estimates of overhead attributable to the projects 
the useful lives of purchased software and capitalized software are assigned by management  based upon the expected life of the software 
we also estimate the realizability of purchased and capitalized values based on undiscounted projections of future net operating cash flows through the sale of the respective products 
if we determine in the future that the value of purchased or capitalized software cannot be recovered  a write down of the value of the software to its recoverable value may be required 
if the actual achieved revenues are lower than our estimates or the useful life of a product is shorter than the estimated useful life  the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset or a shorter amortization period may be required 
other long lived assets other long lived assets  including patents  property and equipment and customer relationships  are amortized over their expected lives  which are estimated by us 
we also make estimates of the impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the assets recovery 
if the actual useful life of a long lived asset is shorter than the useful life estimated by us  the assets may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the assets generally determined by a 
table of contents discounted cash flow analysis or a shorter depreciation or amortization period may be required 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of customer relationships in goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
our policy provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment as of december of each year 
in calculating potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets using either quoted market prices or  if not available  by estimating the expected present value of their future cash flows 
identification of  and assignment of assets and liabilities to  a reporting unit require our judgment and estimates 
in addition  future cash flows are based upon our assumptions about future sales activity and market acceptance of our products 
if these assumptions change  we may be required to write down the carrying value of the asset to a revised amount 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill and trade names in and share based compensation expense we use the modified prospective transition method of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which we adopted on january  to account share based awards previously we accounted for such costs under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant utilizing certain assumptions including expected volatility  which we base on the historical volatility of our stock and other factors  and estimated option life  which represents the period of time the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based  in part  on historical data 
we also estimate employee terminations option forfeiture rate  which is based  in part  on historical data 
although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share based compensation expense are reasonable  these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events  which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty 
in addition  significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the pronouncement also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
pursuant to fin no 
 we have reclassified as noncurrent  unrecognized tax benefits not expected to be paid within one year 
in may  the fasb issued staff position fin no 
 definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin no 
which amended fin no 
to provide guidance about how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
under fsp fin no 
 a tax position could be effectively settled through an examination by a taxing authority 
since adoption  we have applied fin no 
in a manner consistent with the provisions of fsp fin no 
the provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with sfas no 
a current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for 
table of contents income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent we establish or change the valuation allowance in a period  the tax effect will flow through the statement of operations 
however  in the case of deferred tax assets of an acquired or merged entity with a valuation allowance recorded for purchase accounting  any change in that valuation allowance will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill to the extent goodwill exists 
otherwise  such valuation allowance will be reflected in the statement of operations 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns  we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
we apply the provisions of fin no 
to determine the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions 
unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based upon new information  resolution with taxing authorities and expiration of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes in the fin liability 
although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty  therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities 
in the calculation of our quarterly provision for income taxes  we use an annual effective rate based on expected annual income and statutory tax rates 
the tax or benefit applicable to significant unused or infrequently occurring items  discontinued operations or extraordinary items are separately recognized in the income tax provision in the quarter in which they occur 
guarantees in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 
 we recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by us  if these arrangements are within the scope of the interpretation 
in addition  we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications  as required under the previously existing gaap  in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred  then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications 
under our standard software license  services and maintenance agreement  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless our licensees from and against certain losses  damages and costs arising from claims alleging the licensees use of our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  we have not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions and  accordingly  we have not recorded a liability relating to such provisions 
under our software license  services and maintenance agreement  we also represent and warrant to licensees that our software products will operate substantially in accordance with published specifications  and that the services we perform will be undertaken by qualified personnel in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices 
historically  only minimal costs have been incurred relating to the satisfaction of product warranty claims 
other guarantees include promises to indemnify  defend and hold harmless each of our executive officers  non employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses  damages and costs incurred by each such individual in administrative  legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on our behalf 
merge healthcare and certain of our former officers are defendants in several lawsuits 
these lawsuits and other legal matters in which we have become involved are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have accrued for indemnification costs as of december  for certain of our former officers for their expenses in connection with such matters and may be required to accrue for additional guarantee related costs in future periods 
loss contingencies we have accrued for costs as of december  and may  in the future  accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies  including  but not limited to settlement of legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies 
table of contents are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to previous accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is principally effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
pursuant to sfas no 
 a business entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no
