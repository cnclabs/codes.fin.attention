oil and gas marketing and major customers marketing 
essentially all of our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our condensate and crude oil production is sold to various purchasers under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant 
revenues from these sources as a percent of oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  was as follows louis dreyfus corporation shell trading texla energy management inc 
table of contents competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production will depend in part on the cost and availability of alternative fuels  the level of consumer demand  the extent of domestic production of oil and gas  the extent of importation of foreign oil and gas  the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities  regulations by state and federal authorities and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations 
employees at march   we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and one field office  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection and well testing

regulations the availability of a ready market for any natural gas and oil production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of natural gas and oil production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of natural gas and oil available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of natural gas and oil  protect rights to produce natural gas and oil between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of natural gas and oil produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 
environmental matters our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the assessment of remedial obligations  and the imposition of injunctions that may limit or prohibit some or all of our operations 

table of contents the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws to which our business operations are subject and with which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the sites where the release occurred  and those that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for remediation costs at the site  natural resource damages and for the costs of certain health studies 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes which impose requirements related to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
while there exists an exclusion from the definition of hazardous wastes for certain materials generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and gas  we generate petroleum product wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that may be regulated as solid and hazardous wastes 
we currently own or lease  and in the past have owned or leased  properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes  remediate contaminated property  or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
the federal water pollution control act  as amended  clean water act  and analogous state law  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into state and federal waters 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of opa imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liabilities for specified oil removal costs and certain other damages including natural reservoir damages arising from a spill 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with the clean water act and opa requirements 
the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state laws  regulates emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements 
epa has developed  
table of contents and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements 
in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases  referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  the current session of the us congress is considering climate change related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions 
one bill recently approved by the us senate environment and public works committee  known as the lieberman warner climate security act or s  would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between and the lieberman warner bill proposes a cap and trade scheme of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions a ban on emissions above a defined reducing annual cap 
covered parties will be authorized to emit greenhouse emissions through the acquisition and subsequent surrender of emission allowances that may be traded or acquired on the open market 
debate and a possible vote on this bill by the full senate are anticipated to occur before mid year in addition  at least one third of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
depending on the particular program  we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances  either for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our operations or from combustion of fuels eg  oil or natural gas we produce 
also  as a result of the eg supreme court s decision on april  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  the epa may regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks  even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
the epa has indicated that it will issue a rulemaking notice to address carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and automobile fuels  although the date for issuance of this notice has not been finalized 
the court s holding in massachusetts that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide fall under the federal clean air act s definition of air pollutant may also result in future regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under certain caa programs 
new federal or state laws requiring adoption of a stringent greenhouse gas control program or imposing restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide in areas of the united states in which we conduct business could adversely affect our cost of doing business and demand for the oil and gas we produce 
state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
item a 
risk factors our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 

table of contents the following summarizes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by nsa  our independent reserve engineers  and were calculated using oil and gas prices as of december  these prices will change and may be lower at the time of production than those prices that prevailed at the end of reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculating our pv  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
our future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity 
drilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves 
however  drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons 
exploration activities 
table of contents involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and gas prices  limitations in the market for oil and gas  title problems  compliance with governmental regulations  and mechanical difficulties 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 
in addition  we recently completed drilling our fourth horizontal well in the cotton valley trend 
we have only limited experience drilling horizontal wells and there can be no assurance that this method of drilling will be as effective or effective at all as we currently expect it to be 
in addition  higher oil and gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs  equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of  and increasing costs for  such drilling equipment  services and personnel 
such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  a decrease in the price of natural gas or oil would adversely impact our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 
crude oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile 
average oil and natural gas prices fluctuated substantially during the three year period ended december  fluctuations during the past several years in the demand and supply of crude oil and natural gas have contributed to  and are likely to continue to contribute 
table of contents to  price volatility 
any actual or anticipated reduction in crude oil and natural gas prices would depress the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the following table includes high and low natural gas prices price per one million british thermal units or mmbtu and crude oil prices west texas intermediate or wti for  as well as these prices at year end and at march  henry hub per mmbtu february  high september  low december  march  wti per barrel november  high january  low december  march  changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
price changes directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
significant declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our financial derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
for the year ended december   we realized a gain on settled financial derivatives of million 
for the years ended december  and  we realized a loss on settled financial derivatives of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized gain in resulting in a total unrealized and realized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting of million for for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized gain on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million 
for financial reporting purposes  this unrealized gain was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and realized gain on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million for this gain was recognized because the natural gas hedges were deemed ineffective for  and all previously effective oil hedges were deemed ineffective for the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings an unrealized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million 
for financial reporting purposes  
table of contents this unrealized loss was combined with a million realized loss in resulting in a total unrealized and realized loss on derivative instruments not qualifying for hedge accounting in the amount of million in this loss was recognized because the natural gas hedges were deemed to be ineffective for  and accordingly  the changes in fair value of such hedges could no longer be reflected in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent that the hedges are not deemed to be effective in the future  we will likewise be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our hedges 
see note hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
delays in development or production curtailment affecting our material properties may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
the size of our operations and our capital expenditure budget limits the number of wells that we can develop in any given year 
complications in the development of any single material well may result in a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a relatively small number of wells contribute a substantial portion of our production 
if we were to experience operational problems resulting in the curtailment of production in any of these wells  our total production levels would be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and gas property  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
we may have difficulty financing our planned growth 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs  particularly as a result of our drilling program 
in the future  we expect that we will require additional financing  in addition to cash generated from operations  to fund planned growth 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
additionally  recent unfavorable disclosures by international financial institutions concerning the sub prime mortgage market may lead to a contraction in credit availability  thereby impacting our ability to finance our operations 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  we may curtail drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
if we are unable to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december   were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require 
table of contents significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 
we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december   and a similar percentage of our production during were associated with our cotton valley trend 
we sold substantially all of our assets in south louisiana to a private company in a sale that closed in march see note acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  if the level of production from the remaining properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems  government intervention or natural disasters  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
the oil and gas business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
our oil and gas operations are subject to the economic risks typically associated with exploration  development and production activities  including the necessity of significant expenditures to locate and acquire properties and to drill exploratory wells 
in conducting exploration and development activities  the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our exploration  
table of contents development and production activities to be unsuccessful 
this could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular property 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs would be charged against earnings as impairments 
in addition  the cost and timing of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
the nature of the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of such risks and losses 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our senior credit facility and second lien term loan contain customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility and second lien term loan 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our senior credit facility and our second lien term loan was not in existence at that time 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that we created 
we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us are subject to extensive laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties  
table of contents reports concerning operations  and taxation 
in addition  our operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection 
governmental authorities enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in our business 
joint and several strict liabilities may be incurred in connection with discharges or releases of hydrocarbons and wastes due to our handling of hydrocarbons and wastes  the release of air emissions or water discharges in connection with our operations  and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices conducted by us or predecessor operators on  under or from our properties and from facilities where our wastes have been taken for disposal 
private parties affected by such discharges or releases may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as seek damages for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any such changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
we have previously identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and cannot assure you that we will not again identify a material weakness in the future 
as previously reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to recording the fair value of all outstanding derivatives 
the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standard no 
defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
to remediate the material weakness  we implemented changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended june  specifically  we now automatically receive a mark to market 
table of contents valuation from our existing counterparties for all outstanding derivatives 
for any new contracts entered into with a new counterparty  we will concurrently request this automatic distribution 
we also added another layer of review for the fair value calculation before review by the chief financial officer 
our management believes that these additional policies and procedures have enhanced our internal control over financial reporting relating to the determination and review of fair value calculations on outstanding derivatives 
our management also believes that  as a result of these measures described above  the material weakness was remediated and that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of june   september   and december  and all of terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is unknown 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 
the terrorist attacks on september   and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to us without significant additional costs 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital

some of these include  but are not limited to planned capital expenditures  future drilling activity  our financial condition  business strategy  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  legislative and regulatory changes and financial market conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserve and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although from time to time we make use of futures contracts  swaps  costless collars and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged continuation of low prices may adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and natural gas properties primarily in the cotton valley trend of east texas and northwest louisiana 
we operate as one segment as each of our operating areas have similar economic characteristics and each meet the criteria for aggregation as defined in the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in our opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and gas reserves and production on a cost effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and gas company 
management strives to increase our oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through exploration and exploitation activities 
we develop an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by our 
table of contents board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
we take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing our capital expenditure budget 
we place primary emphasis on our internally generated operating cash flow in managing our business 
for this purpose  operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities as reflected in our statement of cash flows 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income 
our revenues and operating cash flow are dependent on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects  the volume and timing of our production  as well as commodity prices for oil and gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond our control  however  we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow 
cotton valley trend our relatively low risk development drilling program in the cotton valley trend is primarily centered in and around rusk  panola  angelina  nacogdoches  cherokee  harrison  smith and upshur counties  texas and desoto and caddo parishes  louisiana 
we continue to build our acreage position in the cotton valley trend and hold approximately  gross acres as of december  as of year end  we have drilled and completed a cumulative total of cotton valley wells with a success rate slightly in excess of 
our net production volumes from our cotton valley trend wells aggregated approximately  mcfe per day in  or approximately of our total oil and gas production in the period 
sale of south louisiana assets on january   the company and malloy energy entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a private company for the sale of substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties in south louisiana 
the total sales price for the company s interest in the oil and gas properties was approximately million  with an economic effective date of july  as a result  we restated our financial information to reflect discontinued operations in our current report on form k dated august  the total sales price for malloy energy s interests in these properties was approximately million with the same effective date 
see note related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding malloy energy 
both the company s and malloy energy s total consideration was reduced by an amount equal to its proportionate share of normal closing adjustments 
the effective date of the transaction was july  and the closing date of the sale was march  the sale resulted in net proceeds of million  after normal closing adjustments 
we recognized a before tax gain of million million gain net of tax on the sale 
average daily production for these properties for the fiscal year ending december   was approximately  mcfe or about of the company s total production for we continue to treat the st 
gabriel  bayou bouillon and plumb bob fields as held for sale 
overview of results financial and operating results include we increased our oil and gas production volumes on continuing operations over production averaged mmcfe d in compared to mmcfe d in our oil and gas revenues from continuing operations totaled million compared to million in  a increase

production increased year to year from  mmcfe to  mmcfe and our average realized price increased from mcfe to per mcfe 
the drilling and completion of wells in the cotton valley trend led to the gains in natural gas production for operating expenses increased to million in the primary driver behind the million increase in operating expenses was a million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a year to year 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues from continuing operations increased or million compared to  to a total of million in the increase resulted from a increase in production volumes from to the drilling and completion of operated wells in the cotton valley trend led to natural gas production more than doubling in the average realized price for natural gas fell in by from per mcf to per mcf 
the average realized oil price was strong in  increasing  from per bbl to per bbl 
year ended december year ended december operating expenses per mcfe variance variance lease operating expenses production and other taxes transportation depreciation  depletion and amortization exploration impairment of oil and gas properties general and administrative operating expenses year ended december  compared to year ended december  lease operating expenses loe for increased to million from million for generally higher operating costs  primarily salt water disposal swd and compression costs  contributed to the majority of the increase in most of our fields experienced increases in the cost of swd due to rising fuel costs for trucking 
we did see lower swd costs for the year in the beckville field  beginning in june  when our east texas low pressure gathering system lpgs in the beckville field became operational 
the lpgs lowers swd costs by utilizing flowlines to pipe the water to the commercial swd wells rather than hauling the water with trucks 
we have plans to reduce our swd costs in the bethany longstreet and angelina river trend fields during higher workover costs also contributed to the higher loe 
workover costs rose per mcfe with increased activity in the beckville and north minden fields million or per mcfe in vs 
million or per mcfe in production and other taxes of million for consist of production tax of million and ad valorem tax of million 
production and ad valorem taxes in were million and million  respectively 
production tax in included million of accrued tight gas sands tgs credits for our wells in the state of texas 
these tgs credits allow for reduced and in many cases the complete elimination of severance taxes in the state of texas for qualifying wells for up to ten years of production 
we only accrue for such credits once we have been notified of the state s approval  and we anticipate that we will incur a gradually lower production tax rate in the future as we add additional cotton valley trend wells to our production base and as reduced rates are approved 
ad valorem tax is assessed on the value of properties as of the first day of the year 
the number of properties we owned increased from january  to january  and the assessed values for our existing properties were higher year to year 
the combination of these two factors led to the increase in ad valorem taxes year to year 
transportation expense was million in compared to million for as production volumes increased year over year 
the unit cost increased nine percent from per mcfe in to per mcfe in due to an increase in production rates from fields requiring greater transportation  and due to several contracts entered into which transported gas to higher valued markets 
dd a expense increased to million in from million for primarily due to a higher dd a rate coupled with higher levels of production 
since we use the successful efforts method of accounting  
table of contents our dd a rate is primarily a function of our capitalized drilling  completion and facilities costs divided by our proved developed reserves 
beginning in late early we embarked on an aggressive drilling program to fully develop our extensive east texas north louisiana cotton valley trend acreage position during a period of record high costs for drilling and completion services 
additionally  to hold the majority of our acreage and thereby allow for the most prudent development plan going forward  we chose to drill many wells in the outlying areas of our acreage block  where per well results were less certain than in the initial established areas 
finally  many of our initial wells in certain fields required us to pay the costs of other industry partners to earn access to the full acreage position 
as such  we believe our dd a rate on a company wide basis will decrease over time as we add more proved developed reserves to our asset base through the drilling of wells where we are more certain of the results and we pay only our proportionate share of the costs 
we calculated first and second quarter dd a rates using the december  reserves  which did not recognize any impact of our cotton valley trend drilling program reserve additions 
during  we engaged nsa  our independent reserve engineers  to fully engineer our june  proved reserve estimates 
this mid year reserve report was used to calculate rates for the third and fourth quarters of as mentioned above  the dd a rate per mcfe based on this report was  which was lower than the rate used for the first half of this year primarily due to the inclusion of more wells drilled in our core areas during the first half of this year relative to the mix of wells in the december  reserve report 
exploration expenses for increased to million from million for exploration expenses on a per unit basis declined to per mcfe in from per mcfe in the increase in exploration expense year to year relates to an increase in leasehold amortization  a non cash expense and the largest component of exploration expense 
we increased our undeveloped acreage position from last year which resulted in higher leasehold cost amortization of million for  compared to million in the same period last year 
we recorded an impairment expense of million for the year ended december   million of which related to our alabama bend field located in the other cotton valley trend leasehold area 
we also recorded an impairment expense of million and million in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively  related to two wells in a non core area of east texas 
we recorded impairment expense in conjunction with the receipt of the independent engineer s year end and mid year reports on reserves 
general and administrative g a expense increased to million for  compared to million for  resulting from generally higher compensation costs and a louisiana franchise tax payment made under protest 
g a on a per unit basis decreased as a result of higher production volumes in salaries and benefits account for a large portion of total g a 
after the sale of substantially all of our properties in south louisiana in march  we had employees 
as of december   we had employees 
we paid million in severance to employees in conjunction with the sale of all of our south louisiana properties in march g a for the year also includes a million non cash charge for the acceleration of vesting of options and restricted stock associated with the resignation of an officer of the company effective august  we accrued a liability for million in march  representing million in penalties and interest and million the state of louisiana asserts we owe for franchise taxes see note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
while we paid this amount under protest in april  we plan to pursue the reimbursement of the full million 
should our efforts prevail  the amounts paid under protest would be refunded

additionally  our oil hedges were deemed ineffective beginning in the fourth quarter of all of our hedges were marked to market in to the extent that our hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting in the future  we will likewise be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our hedges 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  loe was million for compared to million for given the rapid pace of our development program in the cotton valley trend in  we experienced significant increases in two major components of loe  salt water disposal costs million and compressor rental expense million 
higher workover activity also contributed to a higher cost per mcfe in the majority of this activity occurred during the fourth quarter of production and other taxes of million for consist of production tax of million and ad valorem tax of million 
production and ad valorem taxes in were million and million  respectively 
the reduction in production taxes per mcfe resulted from rebates approved by the state of texas of million 
these severance tax rebates relate to a number of our wells which have been approved as high cost tgs wells  allowing us to pay a lower severance tax rate for up to years following certification by the state 
transportation expense was million for compared to million for the significant increase in transportation expense was due to the requirement for longer transportation segments in our cotton valley trend properties 
as our volumes from the cotton valley trend expanded over during  our transportation expense increased accordingly 
dd a expense was million for the year ended december   versus million for the year ended december   with the increase due to higher production volumes and higher dd a rates 
the higher rates are a result of an increase in capitalized development costs 
exploration expense for the year ended december   was million versus million for the year ended december  leasehold amortization was million versus million in we recorded an impairment expense of million in the year ended december   million of which related to two fields in east texas which were not a part of the company s primary cotton valley trend acreage position  and the remaining million was spread among several minor properties 
we recorded this impairment expense in conjunction with the receipt of the independent engineer s final report on reserves as of that date

on january   the initial purchasers of the series b convertible preferred stock exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares at the same price per share  resulting in net proceeds of million  which was used to fund our capital expenditure program 
each share is convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock  par value per share the common stock at any time at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per share  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock  we may choose to deliver the conversion value to holders in cash  shares of common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
if a fundamental change occurs  holders may require us in specified circumstances to repurchase all or part of the series b convertible preferred stock 
in addition  upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate events  we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock 
a fundamental change will be deemed to have occurred if any of the following occurs we consolidate or merge with or into any person or convey  transfer  sell or otherwise dispose of or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any person  or any person consolidates with or merges into us or with us  in any such event pursuant to a transaction in which our outstanding voting shares are changed into or exchanged for cash  securities  or other property  or we are liquidated or dissolved or adopt a plan of liquidation or dissolution 

table of contents a fundamental change will not be deemed to have occurred if at least of the consideration in the case of a merger or consolidation under the first clause above consists of common stock traded on a us national securities exchange and the series b preferred stock becomes convertible solely into such common stock 
on or after december   we may  at our option  cause the series b convertible preferred stock to be automatically converted into that number of shares of common stock that are issuable at the then prevailing conversion rate  pursuant to the company conversion option 
we may exercise our conversion right only if  for trading days within any period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the announcement of our exercise of the option  the closing price of the common stock equals or exceeds of the then prevailing conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock 
the series b convertible preferred stock is non redeemable by us 
we used the net proceeds of the offering of series b convertible preferred stock to fully repay all outstanding indebtedness under our senior revolving credit facility 
the remaining net proceeds of the offering were added to our working capital to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 
capped call option transactions on december   we closed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting the underwriters discount and estimated offering expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to pay off outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility  and approximately million of the net proceeds to purchase capped call options on shares of our common stock from affiliates of bsc and jp morgan securities inc the capped call option transactions covered  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  approximately million shares of our common stock  and each of them was divided into a number of tranches with differing expiration dates 
one third of the options will expire over each of three separate multi day settlement periods beginning approximately months  months and months from the closing of the offering  respectively 
the capped call option transactions are expected to result in our receipt  on a net share  cashless basis of a certain number of shares of our common stock if the market value per share of the common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call option agreements  on the option expiration date for the relevant tranche is greater than the lower call strike price of the capped call option transactions 
we refer to the amount by which the market value per share exceeds the lower call strike price as an in the money amount for the relevant tranche of the capped call option transaction 
the in the money amount will never exceed the difference between the upper call strike price and the lower call strike price ie  it will be capped 
the lower call strike price is  which corresponds to the price to the public in the equity offering and the upper call strike price is  which corresponds to of the price to the public in the offering 
both lower and upper call strike prices are subject to customary anti dilution and certain other adjustments 
the number of shares of our common stock that we will receive from the option counterparties upon expiration of each tranche of the capped call option transactions will be equal to the in the money amount of that tranche divided by the market value per share of the common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call option agreements  on the option expiration date for that tranche 
if the stock price is equal to the upper call strike price of on each of the settlement dates  we will recoup up to million shares 
the capped call option agreements are separate transactions entered into by us with the option counterparties and were not part of the terms of the offering of common stock 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list in note description of business and significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting we use the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures and to calculate dd a 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
certain costs related to fields or areas that are not fully developed are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved oil and natural gas reserves 
impairment of properties we continually monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets to ensure that they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
asset retirement obligations we are required to make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and gas properties 
this requirement necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when 
table of contents income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
we periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carryforwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in our financial statements 
as of december   and in certain prior years  we have reported a net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet  after deduction of the related valuation allowance  which has been determined on the basis of management s estimation of the likelihood of realization of the gross deferred tax asset as a deduction against future taxable income 
in the third quarter of  we increased our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by million and recognized a non cash writedown of our net deferred tax asset to zero 
as of december   we have reported a net deferred tax asset of zero 
fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  provides guidance on recognition and measurement of uncertainties in income taxes and is applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin in the first quarter of see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
derivative instruments as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we periodically use derivative instruments to manage both our commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
we consider the use of these instruments to be hedging activities 
pursuant to derivative accounting rules  we are required to use mark to market accounting to reflect the fair value of such derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that we are able to demonstrate that our use of derivative instruments qualifies as hedging activities  the offsetting entry to the changes in fair value of these instruments is accounted for in other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent that such derivatives are deemed to be ineffective  the offsetting entry to the changes in fair value is reflected in earnings 
at the inception of each hedge  we document that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the item hedged 
a hedge must be determined to be highly effective under accounting rules to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
this assessment  which is updated quarterly  includes an evaluation of the most recent historical correlation between the derivative and the item hedged 
in this analysis  changes in monthly settlement prices on our oil and gas derivatives are compared with the change in physical daily indexed prices that we receive from the field purchasers for our oil and gas production designated for hedging 
should a hedge not be highly effective  it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and changes in fair value of the hedge are recognized in earnings 
price volatility within a measured month is the primary factor affecting the analysis of effectiveness of our oil and natural gas swaps 
volatility can reduce the correlation between the hedge settlement price and the price received for physical deliveries 
secondary factors contributing to changes in pricing differentials include changes in the basis differential which is the difference in the locally indexed price received for daily physical deliveries of hedged quantities and the index price used in hedge settlement  and changes in grade and quality factors of the hedged oil and natural gas production which would further impact the price received for physical deliveries 
not withstanding the determination that certain commodity swaps in and the fourth quarter of were not highly effective  management continues to believe that our oil and gas price hedge strategy has been effective in satisfying our financial objective of providing cash flow stability 
our hedge agreements currently consist of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex and field prices  b collars  where we receive the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pay the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price  and c fixed price physical contracts  which are term contracts priced at the field level 
the terms of our current hedge agreements are described in note hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents share based compensation plans for all new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  we measure at fair value and recognize as compensation expense over the requisite period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model that requires us to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model 
the black scholes valuation model uses the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term of option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatility estimates are developed by us based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the grant date 
our common stock does not pay dividends  therefore the dividend yield is zero

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk despite the measures taken by us to attempt to control price risk  we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
domestic crude oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
we enter into futures contracts or other hedging agreements from time to time to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of our production 
we consider these agreements to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in our crude oil and natural gas sales 
our strategy  which is administered by the hedging committee of the board of directors  and reviewed periodically by the entire board of directors  has been to generally hedge between and of our production 
as of december   the commodity hedges we use were in the form of a swaps  where we receive a fixed price and pay a floating price  based on nymex quoted prices  b collars  where we receive the excess  if any  of the floor price over the reference price  based on nymex quoted prices  and pay the excess  if any  of the reference price over the ceiling price  and c fixed price physical contracts  whereby we agree in advance with the purchasers of our physical gas volumes as to specific quantities to be delivered and specific prices to be received for gas deliveries at specific transfer points in the future 

table of contents see note hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at february   we had the following commodity hedges in place in millions fixed price physical contracts daily volume total volume average price natural gas mmbtu q q q q collars floor cap natural gas mmbtu q q q q q q q q swaps nymex average price natural gas mmbtu q q q q q q q swaps texok price natural gas mmbtu q q q q normal sale at a fixed field delivery point  a comparable nymex average price of 
the index price is based upon natural gas pipeline of america  texok zone as published in the inside ferc

our hedging contracts fall within our targeted range of to of our estimated net oil and gas production volumes for the applicable periods of the fair value of the crude oil and natural gas hedging contracts excluding those designated as normal sales in place at december   resulted in a current asset of million and a long term liability of million 
based on oil and gas pricing in effect at december   a hypothetical increase in oil and gas prices would have resulted in a current derivative liability of million while a hypothetical decrease in oil and gas prices would have increased the current derivative asset to million 
a hypothetical increase in oil and gas prices would have increased the long term derivative liability to million while a hypothetical decrease in oil and gas prices would have resulted in a long term derivative asset of million 

table of contents interest rate risk we have a variable rate debt obligation that exposes us to the effects of changes in interest rates 
to partially reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had the following interest rate swaps in place with bnp in millions effective date maturity date libor swap rate notional amount the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts in place at december   resulted in a current liability of million 
based on interest rates at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the asset
