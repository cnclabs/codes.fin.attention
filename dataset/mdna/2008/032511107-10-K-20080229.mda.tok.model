item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general anadarko petroleum corporation s primary line of business is the exploration  development  production  gathering  processing and marketing of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the company s major areas of operations are located in the united states and algeria 
the company also has activity in china  brazil and several other countries 
the company s focus is on adding high margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas 
the primary factors that affect the company s results of operations include  among other things  commodity prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  production volumes  the company s ability to find additional oil and gas reserves  as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations 
unless the context otherwise requires  the terms anadarko or company refer to anadarko petroleum corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
on august   anadarko completed the acquisition of kerr mcgee in an all cash transaction totaling billion plus the assumption of billion of debt 
on august   anadarko completed the acquisition of western in an all cash transaction totaling billion plus the assumption of million of debt 
anadarko initially financed billion for the acquisitions under a day committed acquisition facility 
in conjunction with the acquisitions  anadarko implemented an asset realignment program 
the goal of the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential  with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to anadarko s operations 
during  the company successfully completed the majority of the divestitures associated with the realignment program 
divestitures under the realignment program in and contributed proceeds of approximately billion before income taxes 
as expected  anadarko s proved reserves after completing the divestitures were about equal to levels before the acquisitions 
for additional information about the benefits the company believes are provided by the realigned portfolio  see outlook 
through december   the company had paid down its borrowings under the acquisition facility to billion with proceeds from asset divestitures  long term refinancing and free cash flow from operations

during  anadarko changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from full cost to the successful efforts method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method  as prescribed by sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
although the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development continues to be an accepted alternative  the successful efforts method of accounting is the preferred method 
the company believes the successful efforts method provides a more transparent representation of its results of operations and the ability to assess the company s investments in oil and gas properties for impairment based on their estimated fair values rather than being required to base the valuation on prices and costs as of the balance sheet date 
the effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the full year ended december  was an increase of approximately billion or per diluted share 
the effect of the accounting change on income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was a decrease of million or per diluted share

anadarko s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to the company s financing methods or capital structure 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions to shareholders 
adjusted ebitdax  as defined by anadarko  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  and therefore  the company s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with income from continuing operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities

acquisitions and divestitures in august  anadarko acquired kerr mcgee and western in separate all cash transactions 
anadarko initially financed billion for the acquisitions through a day committed acquisition facility with plans to repay it with proceeds from asset divestitures  free cash flow from operations and the issuance of equity  debt and bank financing during the term of the facility 
through december   the company had reduced the initial amount owed under the acquisition facility from billion to approximately billion  using divestiture proceeds  long term debt financing and cash flow from operations 
kerr mcgee transaction on august   anadarko completed the acquisition of kerr mcgee for billion  or per share  plus the assumption of billion of debt 
kerr mcgee s year end proved reserves  excluding gulf of mexico shelf divestitures  totaled mmboe  of which approximately was natural gas 
proved undeveloped reserves represented of the total 
kerr mcgee s legacy core properties are located in the deepwater gulf of mexico and onshore in colorado and utah 
they include deepwater gulf of mexico blocks which are supported by kerr mcgee s hub and spoke infrastructure 
in colorado  kerr mcgee holds acreage in the wattenberg natural gas play  located largely on anadarko s land grant holdings  where anadarko owns the royalty interest 
in utah  kerr mcgee holds acreage in the uinta basin s prolific greater natural buttes gas play 
in addition to its us portfolio  kerr mcgee produces oil and is continuing to develop and explore offshore china  has made discoveries and is pursuing the development of fields offshore brazil  and is exploring west africa and the islands of trinidad and tobago 
western transaction on august   anadarko completed the acquisition of western for billion  or per share  plus the assumption of million of debt 
western s year end proved reserves totaled mmboe  with proved undeveloped reserves representing of the total 
essentially all of the reserves are natural gas 
western s coalbed methane properties within the powder river basin are directly adjacent to anadarko s assets in this developing play 
anadarko believes that combining its properties with western s will accelerate the development of these natural gas resources and produce volume growth through the end of the decade  and possibly longer  with more than  identified drilling locations in inventory 
the acquisition of western also significantly increased the company s holdings in gathering and processing systems 
divestitures as a result of a portfolio refocusing effort stemming from the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western  anadarko divested certain properties during and for approximately billion before income taxes 
net proceeds from these divestitures were used to retire debt 
while the company has identified some additional assets for possible monetization  the vast majority of producing property divestitures were closed by year end during  anadarko sold its wholly owned subsidiary  anadarko canada corporation  for approximately billion before taxes 
see discontinued operations 
on the acquisition date  kerr mcgee s other assets included approximately billion of assets held for sale 
the sale of these assets closed in august and the proceeds were also used to pay down debt incurred to fund the acquisitions

proved reserves anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is a key to growth 
future profitability depends upon the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
in conjunction with the august acquisition of kerr mcgee and western  anadarko implemented an asset realignment program 
the goal of the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential  with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to anadarko s operations 
during  the company successfully completed the majority of the divestiture stage of the realignment program 
as expected  anadarko s proved reserves were about equal to levels before the acquisitions 
for additional information about the benefits the company believes are provided by the realigned portfolio  see outlook 
the following discussion of proved reserves  reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves includes both continuing and discontinued operations 
a breakdown of reserve information by continuing and discontinued operations is contained in the supplemental information under item of this form k 
mmboe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions and revisions sales in place production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end were billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and billion barrels at year end crude oil  condensate and ngls comprised about  and of the company s proved reserves at year end  and  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
the available data reviewed include  among other things  seismic data  structure and isopach maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  reservoir simulation models  reservoir pressures  individual well and field performance data  individual well and field projections  offset performance data  operating expenses  capital costs and product prices 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling 
sustained decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
reserve additions and revisions during  the company added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions purchases in place  discoveries  improved recovery and extensions and revisions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve adds to come from positive revisions associated with infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in north america and the deepwaters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through improved recovery operations  purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
additions during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves 
the company added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in coalbed methane and conventional plays of the rockies and the initial recognition of proved reserves at the peregrino field in brazil 
during  anadarko added  mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount   mmboe were related to purchases in place primarily associated with the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western in august in addition  the company added mmboe of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in core areas onshore in the united states 
during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount  mmboe were added as a result of successful drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico and fields in the north louisiana vernon  east texas bossier  west texas haley and canadian wild river areas and successful improved recovery operations in wyoming 
revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
the revisions were related primarily to the large onshore natural gas plays such as greater natural buttes  wattenberg  and pinedale and jonah fields  where the reserve bookings for the infill wells are treated as a positive revision  and the increase in oil and natural gas prices 
total revisions for and were mmboe and mmboe  respectively 
revisions in related primarily to performance revisions of mmboe mainly due to downward revisions of the company s reserves at the k complex in the gulf of mexico and adjustments in algeria  and price revisions of mmboe primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices since the end of  partially offset by additional infill drilling reserve bookings of mmboe 
revisions in related primarily to additional infill drilling reserve bookings of mmboe  partially offset by the impact of government imposed limits on production in venezuela  as well as a reduction of ngls reserves in algeria resulting from a change in project scope 
sales in place in  the company sold properties located in the united states and qatar representing mmboe and mmboe of proved reserves  respectively

this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the increase of billion or in compared to is primarily due to higher natural gas and oil prices at year end and successful exploration and development  partially offset by the divestiture program 
see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
midstream strategies anadarko invests in midstream gathering and processing facilities to complement its oil and gas operations in regions where the company has natural gas production 
the company is better able to control the timing of development of its oil and gas properties and manage both the value received for  and cost of  gathering  treating and processing natural gas through its ownership and operation of these facilities 
in addition  anadarko s midstream business provides gathering  treating and processing services for third party customers  including major and independent producers 
anadarko generates revenues in its gathering and processing activities through various fee structures that include fixed rate  percent of proceeds  or keep whole agreements 
the company also processes a portion of its gas at various third party plants 
in  anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through the acquisitions of western and kerr mcgee 
anadarko currently has systems in eight states wyoming  colorado  utah  new mexico  kansas  oklahoma  texas and louisiana located in major producing basins of the onshore united states 
on october   western gas partners  lp the partnership  a newly formed owned subsidiary of the company  filed a registration statement on form s with the sec relating to a proposed underwritten initial public offering of million common units  representing limited partnership interests in the partnership  plus an option for the underwriters to purchase up to an additional million common units 
the partnership was initially formed by anadarko  the indirect owner of the general partner of the partnership  to own and develop midstream assets 
upon completion of this transaction  anadarko expects to hold approximately of the interests in the partnership 
anadarko will retain indirect ownership of the general partnership interest in the partnership and will continue to operate the partnership s assets pursuant to an omnibus agreement  a services and secondment agreement and a tax sharing agreement 
since gathering and processing assets support anadarko s oil and gas producing activities  anadarko plans to maintain operational control of the assets and expects to continue to consolidate the results of that business in its financial statements 
the company expects to use proceeds it receives from this transaction to repay a portion of the midstream note payable to a related party discussed below 
in december  a midstream subsidiary issued a billion note payable to a related party

marketing strategies the company s marketing department manages sales of its natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
in marketing its production  the company attempts to maximize realized prices while managing credit exposure 
the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
in  the company also engaged in sales of greenhouse gas emission reduction credits ercs derived from co 

injection operations in wyoming 
the company expects additional sales of ercs in the future 
the company also purchases natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow anadarko to aggregate larger volumes  fully utilize transportation capacity  attract larger  creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to

index to financial statements maximize prices received for the company s production and minimize balancing issues with customers and pipelines during operational disruptions 
the company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the company does not engage in market making practices and limits its trading activities to natural gas  crude oil and ngls commodity contracts 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
see energy price risk under item a of this form k 
in an effort to protect the company from commodity price risk stemming from the acquisitions  the company entered into derivatives covering and of the acquired companies then expected production volumes for and  respectively 
this price risk management program employed collars and other derivatives  intended to help ensure a return on investment while maintaining upside potential that could result from higher commodity prices 
in recent years  all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition  liquidity and credit 
this has been reflected in credit rating downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies 
anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third parties  however  in certain situations the company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases 
natural gas natural gas continues to fulfill a significant portion of north america s energy needs and the company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue 
natural gas prices have varied over the last year  with an overall decline in prices during price volatility persists due to a relatively tight supply and demand balance 
anadarko markets its natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets 
anadarko energy services company aesc  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  is a marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management and other services tailored to its customers needs 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
the company owns a significant amount of natural gas firm transportation capacity that is used to help ensure access to downstream markets and provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
the company also stores some of its purchased natural gas in contracted storage facilities with the intent of selling the gas at a higher price in the future 
normally  the company will have forward contracts in place physical delivery or financial derivative instruments to sell the stored gas at a fixed price 
western and kerr mcgee both have gas marketing organizations that are being incorporated into aesc 
kerr mcgee had a long term gas sales contract with cinergy since acquired by fortis 
in  approximately of gas volumes and revenues associated with the kerr mcgee acquisition were sold under this legacy contract 
this contract was terminated in march  and the associated volumes were integrated into the company s marketing operations 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the us  algeria and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices  adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
oil from algeria is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products such as jet and diesel fuel 
oil from china is sold by tanker as cao fei dian cfd blend to customers primarily in the far east markets 
cfd blend is a heavy sour crude oil which is sold into both the prime fuels refining market and the heavy fuel oil blend stock market 
the company also purchases and sells third party produced crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of contracted ngls storage facilities and various derivative instruments

in addition  the company used million of cash from the divestitures to retire debt in following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows during the period 
forward looking information related to the company s capital resources and liquidity are discussed in outlook that follows 
divestitures during  anadarko derived significant sources of cash from its divestiture program 
see acquisitions and divestitures 
proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce debt and pay income taxes on taxable gains associated with the divestitures 
cash flow from operating activities anadarko s cash flow from continuing operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in cash flow was attributed to the impact of income taxes on divestitures and higher costs and expenses  partially offset by the impact of higher sales volumes associated with the acquisitions 
the company had tax payments of billion in that significantly impacted cash flow from operating activities as a result of the taxable gains on the divestitures 
this decrease was effectively offset by an increase in cash flow from investing activities where proceeds from divestitures are presented before income taxes 
the increase in cash flow compared to was attributed to the impact of the acquisitions and higher commodity prices  partially offset by higher costs and expenses and slightly lower legacy sales volumes 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk 
sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in prior years 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement  the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations and the level of acquisition and divestiture activity 
debt at year end  anadarko s total debt was billion compared to total debt of billion at year end and billion at year end during  the company repaid billion in debt that was classified as current at december   primarily with proceeds from divestitures and the issuance of a long term billion midstream note payable discussed below 
the increase in debt in was attributed primarily to borrowings associated with the acquisitions 
in january  anadarko entered into forward looking month interest rate swaps effective march with an aggregate notional value of billion whereby the company will pay a weighted average fixed interest rate of and receive a floating interest rate indexed to the three month libor rate 
anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on january   therefore all gains and losses associated with these swaps will be recorded to interest expense

additions to properties and equipment on the consolidated statement of cash flows include certain adjustments that give effect for the timing of actual cash payments in order to represent a cash basis 
anadarko s capital expenditures decreased in compared to the company s capital spending increased in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in development drilling and construction expenditures and a decrease in exploration lease acquisition activity  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures on gathering and processing facilities 
the increase in resulted primarily from an increase in exploration lease acquisitions  offshore drilling completions  development of the cbm infrastructure and capital expenditures of the acquired companies

anadarko completed the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western in august in two separate all cash transactions 
as of december   the company had reduced the initial amount owed under a facility that was used to finance the acquisitions to approximately billion using divestiture proceeds  long term debt financings and cash flow from operations 
the company expects to repay the remaining balance owed under the facility  which matures in march  with proceeds from identified divestitures and excess cash  possibly supplemented with short term 
table of contents 
index to financial statements borrowings 
as discussed previously  anadarko intends to reduce its economic interest in certain midstream assets through the formation and initial public offering of a master limited partnership 
the net after tax proceeds from this transaction will be used to reduce indebtedness under the midstream note payable to a related party 
the objective of the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions was to provide a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential  with the intent of divesting properties that were no longer deemed to be core to anadarko s operations 
during  the company successfully completed the majority of the divestiture stage of the realignment program 
as expected  anadarko s proved reserves after completing the divestitures were about equal to levels before the acquisitions 
the company estimates that approximately of the sales volumes for are associated with the properties which have been divested 
the new portfolio is intended to be better balanced  with lower risk us onshore resource plays complementing the volatility inherent in the company s deepwater gulf of mexico and international programs 
the company believes the acquisitions and optimization of its portfolio provide a more efficient collection of lower risk  predictable and consistent producing properties  access to high impact exploration opportunities worldwide through an expanded leasehold position  a substantial inventory of identified prospects  which will help deliver value from the exploratory drilling program over many years to come  and expanded technical capabilities  combining the exploration  development  project management and operational skill sets of all three companies 
the company has an approved capital spending budget of billion 
the company has allocated about of capital spending to development activities  to exploration activities  to gas gathering and processing activities  with the remaining for capitalized interest and other items 
the company expects capital spending by area to be approximately for the rockies  for the southern region  for the gulf of mexico  for international and alaska and for midstream 
emphasis will be on production growth in the rockies  continued development in the gulf of mexico  including the start up of the blind faith platform  and progress toward first production in brazil that is expected in the company s capital discipline strategy is to set capital activity at levels that can be funded with operating cash flows 
anadarko believes that its expected level of cash flow will be sufficient to fund the company s projected operational program for if capital expenditures were to exceed operating cash flow  funds would be supplemented as needed by short term borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place a million committed credit agreement  which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
the company s policy is to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully supported by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may sell securities under its shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property divestitures and additional borrowings  to secure funds when needed 
recent activities prices for the company s natural gas sales are a function of both the new york mercantile exchange nymex prices as well as basis differentials for various sales regions 
the company has been active recently trying to protect against wider basis differentials versus nymex index by utilizing basis hedges and firm transportation agreements 
in january and february of  the company added to its existing nymex hedging program an additional thousand mmbtu d for using three way option collars 
the company now has a total of thousand mmbtu d bcf d of natural gas hedged using three way option collars

subsequent to their formation  the investee entities loaned anadarko an aggregate of billion  which the company used to repay its acquisition related debt 
anadarko has a legal right to setoff and intends to net settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees and the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee

over the past three years  anadarko has entered into several agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over several years 
a previous review of the company s worldwide deepwater drilling inventory  along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market  led anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy 
the company believes these rig contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates financial statements and use of estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to determination of proved reserves  litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and fair values 
in  significant estimates were also involved in accounting for business combinations 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
change in accounting principle in the third quarter of  anadarko changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost to the successful efforts method 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  financial information for prior periods has been revised to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method  as prescribed by sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
for additional information on the impact of the change to the successful efforts method of accounting see note summary of significant accounting policies properties and equipment  note change in accounting principle and note properties and equipment of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
in connection with anadarko s august acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western  the company recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
anadarko uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including information commonly considered by the company s engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill the company is required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more often as circumstances warrant 
the first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then no impairment loss is required 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test  with no impairment indicated 
although anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future  impairment charges may occur if the company is unable to replace the value of our depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule a i  ii  iii  and  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery rates associated with infill drilling 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the dd a rate calculation and the financial statements 
unproved leasehold costs leasehold acquisition costs are initially capitalized 
acquisition costs of unproved leaseholds are assessed for impairment during the holding period and transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent associated with successful exploration activities 
significant undeveloped leases are assessed periodically for impairment individually  based on the company s current exploration plans  and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated 
for unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs  such costs are amortized on a group basis thereby establishing a valuation allowance over the average lease terms of the leases at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon expiration 
costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance  while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
amortization of individual insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases  are included in exploration expense 
as of december   the company had approximately billion of capitalized unproved leasehold costs  primarily from its august acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western 
significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play for example  greater natural buttes area in the rocky mountain region  while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have had limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area 
a majority of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with leases or concessions to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed 
generally  economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests  but may be confirmed by the company s continuing exploitation program 
ultimate recovery of potentially recoverable reserves in areas with established production generally has greater probability than in areas with limited or no prior drilling activity 
a portion of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with the company s exploration program  in which drilling activities have not yet commenced or are inconclusive  and the disposition of such costs will be determined by the success of the company s exploration program 
another portion of the company s unproved leasehold costs are associated with the land grant acreage in which the company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to explore and evaluate the acreage through a to year program 
an estimate as to sensitivity to earnings if assumptions other than those used for impairment of unproved properties is impractical given the broad range and number of assumptions involved and the relatively low level of exploration activities which have occurred during on assets acquired in the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions 
suspended exploratory drilling costs under the successful efforts method of accounting  exploratory drilling costs associated with a discovery well are initially capitalized  or suspended  pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling 
at the end of each quarter  management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular  whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or  in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning  whether development negotiations are under way and proceeding as planned 
if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are not likely to occur  associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
therefore  at any point in time  the company has capitalized costs on its consolidated balance sheet associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in a future period 
at december   suspended exploratory drilling costs were million compared to million at december

index to financial statements impairment of assets a long lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be greater than its future net cash flows 
impairment loss  if any  is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over the asset s fair value 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment  since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices for oil  gas or ngls  estimates of future oil and gas production  development and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the company s estimates of future net cash flows used in the impairment assessments are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect management s long term outlook on prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in the company s business plans and investment decisions 
derivative instruments current accounting rules require that all derivative instruments  other than those that meet specific exclusions  be recorded at fair value 
quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if quotations are not available  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or on valuation techniques 
the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option fair values are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against the applicable counterparty s fair values 
derivative accounting rules require that fair value changes of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period earnings  rather than in the period the derivatives are settled and or the hedged transaction is settled 
this can result in significant earnings volatility 
through the end of  anadarko applied hedge accounting to some of its commodity derivatives 
derivative accounting rules are complex  subject to interpretation in their application  and interpretative guidance continues to evolve 
as a result of this accounting risk  effective january   anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity and interest rate derivatives 
such a change did not affect anadarko s reported financial position or cash flows and did not require adjustments to previously reported financial statements 
benefit plan obligations the company has defined benefit pension plans and supplemental pension plans that are noncontributory and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
determination of the projected benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the company s decisions for amounts contributed into the plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and health care cost projections 
anadarko develops demographics and utilizes the work of third party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations 
discount rate the discount rate assumption used by the company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date 
the company currently uses a yield curve analysis  for a majority of the plans  to support the discount rate assumption 
this analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high quality  non callable  marketable bonds  then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present values of the cash flows are then accumulated  and a weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows 
the consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted average discount rates determined for each of the company s significant pension and postretirement plans 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used by the company as of december  was for pension plans and for other postretirement plans

index to financial statements expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year end pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for the expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections  with consideration of actual five year performance statistics for investments in place 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the company as of december  was 
rate of compensation increases the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general inflation 
the weighted average rate of increase in long term compensation levels assumption used by the company as of december  was 
health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
for year end measurement purposes  the company used separate assumptions of cost increase rates for medical  prescription drugs and dental benefits covered by the plans 
a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits was assumed for  decreasing gradually to in and later years 
for prescription drug benefits  a rate of increase of in the per capita cost was assumed for  decreasing gradually to in and later years 
for dental care costs  the company assumed a flat rate of increase of 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  or changes in their interpretation or administration  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
the company s in house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and  in certain circumstances  outside legal counsel or consultants are utilized 
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded by the company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
the company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and  if required  establishes accruals for such amounts 
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances 
although company management believes its tax accruals are adequate  material changes in these accruals may occur in the future  based on the progress of ongoing tax audits  changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters

fsp fin is effective for anadarko as of january  as of december   anadarko had approximately million in current assets for the right to reclaim cash for derivative instruments 
upon adoption in the first quarter of  anadarko will offset the right to reclaim cash collateral against net derivative positions for which a master netting agreement exists

energy price risk the company s most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a non cash write down of the company s oil and gas properties could be required under successful efforts accounting rules if future oil and gas commodity prices sustained significant decline 
below is a sensitivity analysis of the company s commodity price related derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future equity production of bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil as of december  as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million on these derivative instruments 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would reduce the fair value of these instruments by approximately million 
however  this loss would be substantially offset by an increase in the value of that portion of the company s production covered by the derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative financial instruments entered into for trading purposes 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these derivative instruments of million
