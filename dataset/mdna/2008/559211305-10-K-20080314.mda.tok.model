overview magna entertainment corp 
mec  we or the company owns horse racetracks in california  florida  maryland  texas  oklahoma  ohio  oregon and ebreichsdorf  austria 
in addition  we operated a racetrack in michigan until november and  under a management agreement  operate a racetrack in pennsylvania that we previously owned 
based on revenues  mec is north america s number one owner and operator of horse racetracks  and is a leading supplier  via simulcasting  of live racing content to the growing inter track  off track and account wagering markets 
we currently operate or manage seven thoroughbred racetracks  one standardbred harness racing racetrack and two racetracks that run both thoroughbred and quarterhorse meets  as well as the simulcast wagering venues at these tracks 
also  we previously managed the thoroughbred and standardbred meets at magna racino  but now expect that a local operator will manage future meets at that facility 
three of the racetracks owned or operated by us gulfstream park  remington park and magna racino include casino operations with alternative gaming machines 
in addition  we operate off track betting facilities  a united states national account wagering business known as xpressbet  which permits customers to place wagers by telephone and over the internet on horse races at over north american racetracks and internationally on races in australia  south africa  dubai  germany  the united kingdom and hong kong  and a european account wagering service known as magnabet 
under a series of march agreements with churchill downs incorporated cdi  we own a interest in a joint venture  tracknet media group  llc tracknet media  the content management company formed for distribution of the full breadth of mec s horse racing content 
in addition to making horse racing content available for both mec and cdi  it also makes such content available for third parties  including racetracks  off track betting facilities  casinos and advance deposit wagering companies  and purchases horse racing content from third parties to be made available through cdi s and mec s respective outlets 
the tracknet media arrangement also involves the exchange by mec and cdi of their respective horse racing signals such that cdi s racing content is available for wagering through mec owned tracks and simulcast wagering facilities and through our advanced deposit wagering platform  xpressbet  and our racing content is similarly available for wagering through cdi tracks and off track betting facilities and through cdi owned advance deposit wagering platforms 
a separate joint venture with cdi also involves the ownership by mec and cdi of equal shares in horseracing tv hrtv  a television network focused on horse racing that we initially launched on the racetrack television network rtn 
hrtv is currently distributed to more than million cable and satellite tv subscribers 
rtn  in which we have a minority interest  was formed to telecast races from our racetracks and other racetracks to paying subscribers  via private direct to home satellite 
we also own amtote international  inc amtote  a provider of totalisator services to the pari mutuel industry

we also own and operate production facilities in austria and in north carolina for streufex  a straw based horse bedding product 
in addition to our racetracks  our real estate portfolio includes a residential development in austria 
we are also working with potential developers and strategic partners on proposals for developing leisure and entertainment or retail based projects on excess lands surrounding  or adjacent to  certain of our premier racetracks 
was a challenging year for mec 
although revenues from continuing operations increased by to million  our net loss increased to million from million in  primarily due to increased losses at gulfstream park and continued high debt service costs 
also  in we recognized a million gain on sale of intangible assets related to the meadows and a write down of long lived assets of million 
we discuss our results of operations in detail in the results of operation section below 
following the completion of a strategic review of the company s assets and operations  on september   our board of directors approved a debt elimination plan the plan  designed to eliminate the company s net debt by december  by generating funding from i the sale of certain real estate  racetracks and other assets  ii the sale of  or entering into strategic transactions involving  the company s other racing  gaming and technology operations  and iii a possible future equity issuance 
we also arranged for million of funding to address immediate liquidity concerns and provide sufficient time to implement the plan 
this funding was comprised of i a million private placement of class a subordinate voting stock class a stock to fair enterprise limited fair enterprise  a company that forms part of an estate planning vehicle for the family of frank stronach  mec s chairman and interim chief executive officer the fair enterprise private placement  and ii a short term bridge loan facility of up to million the bridge loan with a subsidiary of our controlling shareholder  mi developments inc mid 
although we continue to implement the plan  since the adoption of the plan  weakness in the us real estate and credit markets has adversely impacted our ability to execute the plan as market demand for our assets has been weaker than expected and financing for potential buyers has become more difficult to obtain 
these conditions have not abated through the date of this report  with the result that it will take us longer to execute the plan than originally anticipated 
as a result  we will likely need to seek extensions from existing lenders and additional funds in the short term from one or more possible sources 
the availability of such extensions and additional funds is not assured and  if available  the terms thereof are not determinable at this time 
at december   we had a working capital deficiency of million and had million of debt that matures in  including i amounts owing under our million senior secured revolving credit facility with a canadian financial institution  which is scheduled to mature on march   ii our million bridge loan  which is scheduled to mature on may   and iii our obligation to repay million of indebtedness under the gulfstream park project financings with a subsidiary of mid by may  accordingly  our financial statements have been prepared with a going concern qualification 
see outlook  liquidity and capital resources and going concern below for more information 
debt elimination plan the plan contemplates selling certain real estate properties  including those situated in the following locations dixon  california  ocala  florida  aventura and hallandale  florida  both adjacent to gulfstream park  porter  new york  anne arundel county  maryland  adjacent to laurel park  and ebreichsdorf  austria  adjacent to the magna racino 
we have initiated an active program to sell the dixon and ocala real estate properties and have listed both of these properties for sale with a real estate broker 
the porter lands  which comprise three parcels of land  have been sold the sale of one parcel closed in december and sales of the remaining two parcels closed in early january the sale of these properties generated net proceeds of approximately million  net of transaction costs  which was used to repay a portion of the bridge loan subsequent to december  we recognized an impairment charge of million in in relation to the porter lands 
on december   we entered into an agreement to sell acres of excess real estate located in ebreichsdorf  austria to a subsidiary of magna international inc  a related party  for a purchase price of euros million approximately us million  subject to customary closing adjustments 
the closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the first quarter of following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals 
we are required to use euros million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of a euros million term loan facility and the remaining portion of the net proceeds is required to be used to repay a portion of the bridge loan 
we also intend to explore the sale of our membership interests in the mixed use developments at gulfstream park in florida and santa anita park in california that we are pursuing under joint venture arrangements with forest city enterprises  inc forest city and caruso affiliated  respectively 
the racetracks that we intend to sell include great lakes downs in michigan  remington park in oklahoma  thistledown in ohio and our interest in portland meadows in oregon 
we ceased racing at great lakes downs on november  and listed the property for sale with a real estate broker in october in september  we engaged a us investment bank  recognized as an experienced advisor in the gaming industry  to assist in soliciting potential purchasers and manage the sale process for certain assets and in october  the us investment bank began marketing remington park and thistledown for sale 
in november  we initiated an active program to locate a buyer and began marketing our interest in portland meadows for sale 
we also intend to explore other strategic transactions involving other racing  gaming and technology operations  including partnerships or joint ventures in respect of the existing gaming facility at gulfstream park  partnerships or joint ventures in respect of potential alternative gaming operations at certain of our other racetracks that currently do not have gaming operations  and transactions involving our technology operations  which may include one or more of the assets that comprise our parimax business 
the real estate properties located in dixon  california and ocala  florida  the two parcels of land in porter  new york  that were sold in january and the excess land in ebreichsdorf  austria that is under a contractual sale agreement  have been classified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as at december  similarly  the operations of great lakes downs  remington park  thistledown and portland meadows have been presented as discontinued operations at december  given that all of these assets met the criteria under us gaap for classification as either assets held for sale or discontinued operations at december  comparative periods presented have been restated to reflect the results of these assets held for sale and discontinued operations on a consistent basis 
outlook although we continue to implement our plan  real estate and credit markets have continued to demonstrate weakness in the first part of this has reduced the likelihood that we will be able to complete asset sales at acceptable prices as quickly as originally contemplated 
in light of these adverse developments  combined with our upcoming debt maturities and operational funding requirements  we will likely need to seek extensions or additional funds in the short term from one or more possible sources 
the availability of such extensions or additional funds from existing lenders  including mid  or from other sources is not assured and  if available  the terms thereof are not determinable at this time 
we expect that we will enter into negotiations with such existing lenders  including mid  with a view to extending  restructuring or refinancing such facilities 
there is no assurance that such negotiations  if any  will result in a favorable outcome for mec 
if we are unable to repay our obligations when due  other current and long term debt will also become due on demand as a result of cross default provisions within loan agreements  unless we are able to obtain waivers or extensions 
unless we are successful in our efforts  we could be required to liquidate assets in the fastest manner possible to raise funds  seek protection from our creditors in one or more ways or be unable to continue as a going concern 
see the going concern section below and the section entitled risk factors risks regarding our company elsewhere in this report for more information

total discontinued operations population residing within miles of each of our racetracks  except for santa anita park and magna racino miles  the meadows miles and great lakes downs miles 
data from urban systems inc amounts comprising total handle and revenue include inter company transactions for our racetracks  account wagering operations and separate otb facilities  for both our importing and our exporting facilities 
revenue excludes our amtote operations  our training centers  hrtv and our straw based horse bedding production facilities in europe and north carolina 
rental and other revenues earned from the oak tree meet are included in santa anita park s revenue 
our primary source of racing revenues is commissions earned from pari mutuel wagering 
pari mutuel wagering on horse racing is a form of wagering in which wagers on horse races are aggregated in a commingled pool of wagers the mutuel pool and the payoff to winning customers is determined by both the total dollar amount of wagers in the mutuel pool and the allocation of those dollars among the various kinds of bets 
unlike casino gambling  the customers bet against each other  and not against us  and therefore we bear no risk of loss with respect to any wagering conducted 
we retain a pre determined percentage of the total amount wagered the take out on each event  regardless of the outcome of the wagering event  and the remaining balance of the mutuel pool is distributed to the winning customers 
of the percentage we retain  a portion is paid to the horse owners in the form of purses or winnings  which encourage the horse owners and their trainers to enter their horses in our races 
our share of pari mutuel wagering revenues is based on pre determined percentages of various categories of the pooled wagers at our racetracks 
the maximum pre determined percentages are approved by state regulators 
pari mutuel wagering on horse racing occurs on the live races being conducted at racetracks  as well as on televised racing signals  or simulcasts  received or imported by the simulcast wagering facilities located at such racetracks or otb facilities  and through various forms of account wagering 
our racetracks have simulcast wagering facilities to complement our live horse racing  enabling our customers to wager on horse races being held at other racetracks 
we derive our pari mutuel wagering revenues from the following primary sources wagers placed at our racetracks or our otb facilities on live racing conducted at our racetracks  wagers placed at our racetracks simulcast wagering venues or our otb facilities on races imported from other racetracks  wagers placed at other locations ie other racetracks  otb facilities or casinos on live racing signals exported by our racetracks  and wagers placed by telephone or over the internet by customers enrolled in xpressbet or magnabet  our account wagering platforms 
wagers placed at our racetracks or our otb facilities on live racing conducted at one of our racetracks produce more net revenue for us than wagers placed on imported racing signals  because we must pay the racetrack sending us its signal a fee generally equal to to of the amount wagered on its race 
wagers placed on imported signals  in turn  produce more revenue for us than wagers placed on our signals exported to off track venues ie other racetracks  otb facilities or casinos  where we are paid a commission generally equal to only to of the amount wagered at the off track venue on the signal we export to those venues 
revenues from our telephone and internet account wagering operations vary depending upon the source of the signal upon which the wager is placed 
we also generate gaming revenues from our gulfstream park and remington park which is reflected as discontinued operations gaming operations 
gaming revenues represent the net win earned on slot wagers 
net win is the difference between wagers placed and winning payouts to patrons 
we also generate non wagering revenues which include totalisator equipment sales and service revenues from amtote earned in the provision of totalisator services to racetracks  food and beverage sales  program sales  admissions  parking  sponsorship  rental fees and other revenues 
live race days are a significant factor in the operating and financial performance of our racing business 
another significant factor is the level of wagering per customer on our racing content on track  at inter track simulcast locations and at otb facilities 
there are also many other factors that have a significant impact on our racetrack revenues 
such factors include  but are not limited to attendance at our racetracks  inter track simulcast locations and otb facilities  activity through our xpressbet and magnabet systems  the number of races conducted at our racetracks and at racetracks whose signals we import and the average field size per race  our ability to attract the industry s top horses and trainers  inclement weather  and changes in the economy 
set forth below is a list of the total live race days by racetrack for the years ended december   and years ended december  continuing operations racetracks santa anita park gulfstream park golden gate fields laurel park lone star park pimlico race course the meadows magna racino discontinued operations racetracks thistledown remington park portland meadows great lakes downs total    excludes the oak tree meet which consisted of days in  days in and days in laurel park and pimlico race course constitute the maryland jockey club 
flamboro downs had live race days in to the date of its sale on october  the results of flamboro downs in have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize racing revenue prior to our payment of purses  stakes  awards and pari mutuel taxes 
the racing costs relating to these revenues are shown as pari mutuel purses  awards and other in our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize gaming revenue prior to our payment of taxes and purses 
the gaming costs relating to these revenues are shown as gaming purses  taxes and other in our consolidated financial statements 
our operating costs principally include salaries and benefits  the cost of providing totalisator services and manufacturing totalisator equipment  utilities  the cost of food and beverages sold  racetrack repairs and maintenance expenses  sales and marketing expenses  rent  printing costs  property taxes  license fees and insurance premiums 
seasonality most of our racetracks operate for prescribed periods each year 
as a result  our racing revenues and operating results for any quarter will not be indicative of our racing revenues and operating results for any other quarter or for the year as a whole 
because five of our largest racetracks  santa anita park  gulfstream park  lone star park at grand prairie  pimlico race course and golden gate fields  run live race meets principally during the first half of the year  our racing operations have historically operated at a loss in the second half of the year  with our third quarter generating the largest operating loss 
this seasonality has resulted in large quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results 
real estate and other operations our real estate and other revenues represent revenues earned from our european residential development 
we characterize our real estate as follows revenue producing racing and gaming real estate real estate at our racetracks used in our racing and gaming operations  excess racing real estate excess real estate at our racetracks that we are considering developing with strategic partners or otherwise  and revenue producing non racing real estate developed real estate not at our racetracks that is currently generating revenue for us 
as of december   the aggregate net book values of our real estate properties are as follows millions revenue producing racing and gaming real estate excess racing real estate revenue producing non racing real estate included in our excess racing real estate is land adjacent to certain of our racetracks  santa anita park  gulfstream park  lone star park at grand prairie  laurel park in respect of which we disposed of a portion of the excess land  a acre parcel in february  pimlico race course and magna racino 
we are considering a variety of options with respect to this excess land  including entertainment and retail based developments that could be undertaken in conjunction with business partners who might provide the necessary financing 
our revenue producing non racing real estate includes our european residential development 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and prudent in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets our most significant intangible assets are racing licenses which represent the value attributed to licenses to conduct race meets acquired through our racetrack acquisitions 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  intangibles are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators are present 
racing license impairment is assessed based on a comparison of the fair value of an individual reporting unit s racing license to its carrying value 
an impairment write down to fair value would occur if estimated discounted cash flows from operations less charges for contributory assets assumed to be owned by third parties is less than the carrying value of the racing license 
under financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of the long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than net book value  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value  based on discounted future cash flows and appraisals  is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management 
when long lived assets are identified as available for sale  if necessary  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value less costs of disposal 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows of the assets  appraisals and  if appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers 
we believe the accounting estimates related to intangibles and long lived asset impairment assessments are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to significant measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to change as management is required to make forward looking assumptions regarding cash flows and business operations 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our consolidated operating results and on the amount of assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
future income tax assets at december   we recorded future tax assets net of related valuation allowances in respect of loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our future tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the allowance as necessary 
the assessment considers forecasts of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the future tax assets 
should operations not yield future taxable income or if tax planning strategies can not be implemented  then there could be a material impact on our consolidated tax expense or recovery and on the amount of future tax assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense recognized in includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
revenue recognition a significant component of our revenues is generated from our racing and gaming operations 
revenues generated from horse racing are recorded on a daily basis and are recognized gross of purses  stakes and awards as well as pari mutuel wagering taxes 
gaming revenues represent the net win earned on slots wagers 
net win is the difference between wagers placed and winning payouts to patrons  and is recorded at the time wagers are made 
non wagering revenues include totalisator equipment sales and service revenues from amtote earned in the provision of totalisator services to racetracks  food and beverage sales  program sales  admissions  parking  sponsorship  rental fees and other revenues 
revenues derived principally from totalisator equipment sales are recognized upon shipment or acceptance of the equipment by the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts 
revenues generated from service contracts in the provision of totalisator services are recognized when earned based on the terms of the service contract 
revenues from food and beverage and program sales are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues from admissions and parking are recorded on a daily basis  except for seasonal amounts which are recorded ratably over the racing season 
revenues from sponsorship and rental fees are recorded ratably over the terms of the respective agreements or when the related event occurs 
revenues from the sale of residential development inventory are recognized when title passes to the purchaser and collection is reasonably assured 
employee defined benefit and postretirement plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas requires employers to recognize the funded status the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income loss  net of tax  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date and provide additional disclosures about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas the adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income loss upon adoption represented the net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  which was previously netted against the plan s funded status pursuant to the provisions of sfas these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated comprehensive income loss upon adoption of sfas litigation in the ordinary course of business  we may be contingently liable for litigation and claims with  among others  customers  suppliers and former employees 
management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts where required 
although it is not possible to accurately estimate the extent of potential costs and losses  if any  management believes  but can provide no assurance  that the ultimate resolution of such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have not been disclosed in either our consolidated financial statements or in this report 
related party transactions refer to note to our consolidated financial statements which describes all material related party transactions 
results of operations the following is a discussion and comparison of our results of operations and financial position for the years ended december   and year ended december  compared to december  racing and gaming operations in  we operated our continuing operations racetracks for fewer live race days compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the awarded live race days at golden gate fields in compared to the prior year and planned reductions in live race days at magna racino 
in  revenues from our racing and gaming operations increased million or to million  compared to million in  primarily due to florida revenues above the prior year by million or due to the opening of casino operations at gulfstream park in november and expanded casino operations in march  which generated million of gaming revenues in  compared to million in  and increased simulcasting revenues with new legislation in which allows us to simulcast year round  partially offset by reductions in wagering at gulfstream park s racing operations  despite one additional live race day  caused  in part  to the limited access to atm banking machines and check cashing services on site at gulfstream park during the live race meet 
parimax revenues above the prior year by million or as a result of the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in amtote in july  which generated incremental revenues of million in and is now being consolidated into the parimax operations  whereas previously our equity interest was accounted for on an equity basis and million of increased revenues at xpressbet due to a increase in us handle compared to the prior year primarily due to having access to cdi racing content  including the kentucky derby  through our tracknet media joint venture arrangement  partially offset by decreased revenues of million at magnabet due to a decline in handle as a result of wagering platform changes and the termination of a contract with a german television service 
maryland operations below the prior year by million or primarily due to fewer live race days at laurel park 
northern us operations below the prior year by million or primarily due to fewer live race days at the meadows 
california revenues below the prior year by million or primarily due to a reduction in live race days at golden gate fields  whereby live race days were decreased from days in to days in european operations below the prior year by million or primarily due to fewer live race days at magna racino

as a percentage of total racing and gaming revenues  operating costs increased from in to in  primarily as a result of higher costs incurred during the start up of the casino operations at gulfstream park 
general and administrative expenses in our racing and gaming operations increased by million or to million in  compared to million in several of our racetracks experienced lower general and administrative expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives  which were more than offset by an increase in our parimax operations with the consolidation of amtote as noted previously

the terms of any such future offerings would be established at the time of such offering

there is no assurance when and if an equity financing could be completed 
going concern the consolidated financial statements included with this report have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and had an accumulated deficit of million and a working capital deficiency of million at december  at december   we had million of debt that matures in  including amounts owing under our million senior secured revolving credit facility with a canadian financial institution which is scheduled to mature on march   and the bridge loan  which is scheduled to mature on may   and our obligation to repay million of indebtedness under the gulfstream park project financings with a subsidiary of mid by may  accordingly  our ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and is dependent on generating cash flows that are adequate to sustain the operations of our business  renewing or extending current financing arrangements and meeting our obligations with respect to secured and unsecured creditors  none of which is assured 
if we are unable to repay our obligations when due  other current and long term debt will also become due on demand as a result of cross default provisions within loan agreements  unless we are able to obtain waivers or extensions 
on september   our board of directors approved the plan which was designed to eliminate net debt by december  by generating funding from the sale of assets  entering into strategic transactions involving certain of our racing  gaming and technology operations  and a possible future equity issuance 
the success of the plan is not assured 
to address short term liquidity concerns and provide sufficient time to implement the plan  we arranged million of funding  comprised of i the fair enterprise private placement  and ii the bridge loan 
although we continue to implement our plan  the sale of assets under the plan is taking longer than originally contemplated 
as a result  we will likely need to seek additional funds in the short term from one or more possible sources 
the availability of such additional funds is not assured and  if available  the terms thereof are not determinable at this time 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements included with this report do not give effect to any adjustments to recorded amounts and their classification  which would be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern and  therefore  be required to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to fund operations  implement our strategic plan and capitalize on future growth opportunities  we will be required to seek additional financing and funds from one or more possible sources  which may include mid  through means such as asset sales  project financings for racing and or alternative gaming developments  investments by partners in certain of our racetracks and other business operations and debt or equity offerings through public or private sources 
if additional financing or other sources of funds are not available to us as needed  or are not available on terms that are acceptable to us  our ability to continue as a going concern  add alternative gaming to our racetracks where and when permitted or improve and expand our operations as planned may be adversely affected 
contractual obligations and commitments our commitments to make future payments consist primarily of repayments of long term debt including capital lease obligations  amounts due to our parent  obligations under operating and facility leases  construction commitments and other long term liabilities 
our contractual obligations and commitments at december  are as follows less than year to years to years more than years total thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations i      amounts due to parent      convertible subordinated notes   operating leases ii     facility leases iii      construction and development project commitments  joint venture funding iv    other liabilities v i the racetrack and associated land under capital lease at lone star park at grand prairie is included in the grand prairie metropolitan utility and reclamation district gpmurd 
lone star park entered into an agreement with gpmurd whereby it is required to make certain payments to gpmurd in lieu of property taxes 
such payments include amounts necessary to cover gpmurd operating expenses and debt service for certain bonds issued by gpmurd to fund improvements on the land up to the debt service requirements

ii operating lease obligations do not include contingent rental payments and represent primarily obligations for totalisator and other equipment under lease  rental or service agreements 
contingent rental payments are typically dependent upon handle  live race days and other factors 
iii facilities lease obligations do not include contingent rental payments and represent primarily obligations for premises under lease or rental agreements 
contingent payments are typically dependent on handle and revenues 
iv joint venture funding represents our obligations with respect to funding the hrtv  llc joint venture to october  v other liabilities includes our expected pension and postretirement benefit contributions 
required pension and postretirement benefit contributions for years beyond depend on certain factors that cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk related to financial instruments or the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices is with respect to our investments in companies with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate relative to the canadian dollar and the euro will result in fluctuations in shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
we have generally not entered into derivative financial arrangements for currency hedging purposes  and have not and will not enter into such arrangements for speculative purposes 
additionally  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as the us prime rate  libor and euribor 
based on interest rates at december  and our current credit and debt facilities  a per annum increase or decrease in interest rates on our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings would not materially affect our annual future earnings and cash flows 
based on borrowing rates currently available to us  the carrying amount of our debt approximates its fair value 
in order to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the sac term loan facility  we have entered into the four interest rate swap contracts described under long term and related party debt 
accounting change in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires an entity to recognize the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not  based on the position s technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by the respective taxing authorities 
the tax benefit is measured as the largest benefit that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon final settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fin on a retroactive basis  which did not result in any charge to accumulated deficit as a cumulative effect of an accounting change or adjustment to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
accordingly  the adoption of fin did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position 
it is our policy to account for interest and penalties associated with income tax obligations as a component of income tax expense 
we did not recognize any interest and penalties as provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended december  as the maximum interest and penalty period have elapsed 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized income tax benefits and million of related accrued interest and penalties net of any tax effect and million of foreign exchange  million of which could ultimately reduce our effective tax rate 
we are currently under audit in austria 
although it is not possible to accurately predict the timing of the conclusion of the audit  we anticipate that the austrian audit relating to the years through will be completed before the end of given the stage of completion of the audit  we are unable to estimate the range of any possible changes to unrecognized income tax benefits the audit may cause over the next year 
in addition  we do not anticipate any other significant changes to unrecognized income tax benefits over the next year 
as of january   the following tax years remained subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions major jurisdictions open years austria through canada through united states through we are subject to income taxes in many state and local taxing jurisdictions in the us and canada  many of which are still open to tax examinations 
management does not believe these represent a significant financial exposure to the company 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently reviewing sfas  but have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas 
sfas allows companies to voluntarily choose  at specified election dates  to measure certain financial assets and liabilities  as well as certain non financial instruments that are similar to financial instruments  at fair value the fair value option 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
if the fair value option is elected for an instrument  sfas specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument be reported in income 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently reviewing sfas  but have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements
