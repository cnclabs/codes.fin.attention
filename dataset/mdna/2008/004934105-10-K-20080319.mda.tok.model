this charge was recorded due to changes in the company s product plans 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements  and financial statement schedules  and supplementary financial data included in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k  including the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our company that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the sec  specifically the most recent reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
overview the purpose of this overview is to provide context for the discussion and analysis of our financial statements that follows by briefly summarizing the most important known trends and uncertainties  as well as the key performance indicators  on which our executives are primarily focused for both the short and long term 
actel corporation is the leading supplier of low power fpgas and pscs 
attacking power consumption from both the chip and the system levels  the company s innovative programmable logic solutions enable power efficient design 
in support of our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based fpgas  we offer design and development software and tools to optimize power consumption  power smart ip cores  including industry standard processor technologies  small footprint packaging  programming hardware and starter kits  and a variety of design services 
we target a wide range of applications in the aerospace  automotive  avionics  communications  consumer  industrial  
table of contents medical  and military markets that require low power or other attributes of our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based technologies that have an inherent competitive advantage 
semiconductor industry according to the semiconductor industry association sia  global sales of semiconductors rose to a record billion in  an increase of from the previous record of billion reported for sales growth was driven primarily by consumer products such as mobile handsets  pcs  and consumer electronics  which have proliferated as semiconductor technology has improved performance and functionality at lower cost 
according to the sia report  industry growth is expected to be in logic market the logic market is highly fragmented and includes asics and plds 
fpgas are one type of pld 
price  performance  reliability  power consumption  security  density  features  ease of use  and time to market determine the degree to which plds compete for specific applications 
unlike asics  which are customized for use in a specific application at the time of manufacture  plds are manufactured as standard components and customized in the field  allowing the same device type to be used for many different applications 
using software tools  users program their design into a pld  resulting in lower development costs and inventory risks  shorter design cycles  and faster time to market 
technology to a great extent  the characteristics of an fpga are dictated by the technology used to make the device programmable 
devices based on nonvolatile flash or antifuse programming elements offer significant power  single chip  live at power up  security  and neutron immunity advantages over volatile fpgas based on sram technology 
flash we believe that our long term future lies with flash technology  which permits us to make fpgas that are both nonvolatile and reprogrammable 
perhaps the single biggest benefit of a nonvolatile flash based fpga array is significantly reduced power consumption 
even though our flash technology is unique  the process is very similar to the standard embedded flash memory process  so we are able to share with others most of the burden of developing and proving the process 
while we were the first company to sell flash based fpgas  several suppliers of sram based fpgas claim to offer single chip  flash based solutions 
however  these hybrid solutions are merely combinations of flash memory components with the underlying sram fpga technology either integrated with the fpga die into a single package or  alternatively  stacked or placed side by side 
the fpga array is still sram  so it is still subject drawbacks associated with that technology 
these hybrid approaches mitigate some of the limitations of traditional sram based solutions by providing a smaller footprint  a minor reduction in power consumption  and small advances in power up time and security  but they are only incremental improvements over pure sram based fpgas 
since the embedded flash memory controls only the initial configuration of hybrid devices during power up  these solutions cannot offer the full advantages of flash technology provided by our nonvolatile flash based fpgas exponentially lower power consumption  faster response times  unparalleled reliability  and uncompromising security 
antifuse the one time programmability of our antifuse based fpgas is desirable in certain system critical military and aerospace applications  but commercial customers generally prefer reprogrammable solutions  such as sram or flash based fpgas 
in addition  we are the only sizeable company that uses antifuse technology  which means we bear the entire burden of developing and proving antifuse processes including yields and reliability and products including switching elements and architectures 
it also means that our fpgas using antifuse technology are typically one or two generations behind competitive sram based solutions manufactured on standard processes 

table of contents strategy our strategy is to offer fpgas to markets in which our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based technologies have an inherent competitive advantage 
our strategy involves considerable risk as unique technologies and products can take years to develop  if at all  and markets that we target may fail to emerge 
however  in addition to single chip  live at power up  security  and neutron immunity benefits  we believe that our nonvolatile fpga solutions offer substantial low power advantages over volatile devices based on sram technology and we plan to exploit those advantages 
key indicators although we measure the condition and performance of our business in numerous ways  the key quantitative indicators that we generally use to manage the business are bookings  design wins  margins  yields  and backlog 
we also carefully monitor the progress of our product development efforts 
of these  we think that bookings and backlog are the best indicators of short term performance and that design wins and product development progress are the best indicators of long term performance 
our bookings measured as end customer orders placed on us and our distributors were higher during than during  and our backlog which may be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer on short notice without significant penalty was significantly higher at the end of than at the end of results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues years ended jan

 net revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development selling  general  and administrative amortization of acquisition related intangibles income loss from operations interest income and other  net of expense income loss before tax provision benefit tax provision benefit net income loss net revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of fpgas  which accounted for over of net revenues in  and non fpga revenues are derived from our protocol design services organization  royalties  and the licensing of software and sale of hardware used to design and program our fpgas 
we believe that we derived at least of our revenues in from sales of fpgas to customers serving the military and aerospace and the communications markets  compared with at least in and we have experienced  and may again in the future experience  substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to conditions in each of these markets as well as in the general economy 
net revenues in were million  an increase of over this increase was due primarily to a increase in the number of units shipped that was partially off set by a decrease of in the overall average selling price asp 
the overall asp decreased primarily due to a change in our product mix the sales of mature 
table of contents products  which usually have higher asps  decreased by approximately from the previous year while sales of new products  particularly our flash products  which usually have lower asps  have increased by approximately from the previous year 
sales of new products comprised approximately of net revenues in compared with approximately in net revenues in were million  an increase of over this increase was due primarily to a increase in the overall average selling price asp and a slight increase in the total number of units shipped in the year 
the overall asp increased primarily due to increases in asps from most of the new and mature product families 
net revenues in increased million as a result of a change in the company s estimate of distributor revenue as noted in critical accounting policies and estimates 
we shipped approximately of our net revenues through the distribution sales channel in compared with in and in since  memec  unique had been our primary distributor in north america 
during  avnet  inc avnet acquired memec group holdings ltd 
memec 
we generally do not recognize revenue on product shipped to a distributor until the distributor resells the product to its customer 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of net revenues in  in and in with european customers representing of net revenues in compared to of net revenues for and gross margin gross margin was of revenues in compared with in and in gross margin in was unfavorably impacted by a fourth quarter write down of million associated with proasic last time buy inventory and higher inventory reserve charges during the lower gross margin in was also attributable to the product mix where there were higher sales of lower margin flash products 
gross margin in was unfavorably impacted by a fourth quarter write down of million associated with excess radiation tolerant products 
gross margin in benefited from lower inventory write downs as compared with fiscal coupled with a reduction in license costs as a result of consolidation of a number of our license agreements with third parties 
we seek to reduce costs and improve gross margins by improving wafer yields  negotiating price reductions with suppliers  increasing the level and efficiency of our testing and packaging operations  achieving economies of scale by means of higher production levels  and increasing the number of die produced per wafer  principally by shrinking the die size of our products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
our capability to shrink the die size of our fpgas is dependent on the availability of more advanced manufacturing processes 
due to the custom steps involved in manufacturing antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas  we typically obtain access to new manufacturing processes later than our competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
research and development r d r d expenditures were million  or of net revenues  in compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in r d spending in increased due to a million charge during the second quarter to reserve for certain wafer prepayments combined with a charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal for re work of certain products under development 
in addition  included generally higher costs associated with expanded r d efforts and increased headcount 
r d spending in increased due to recognition of stock based compensation expense under sfas r  along with higher costs associated with expanded r d efforts and increased headcount 
stock based compensation expenses under sfas r were million in compared with million in our r d consists of circuit design  software development  and process technology activities 
we believe that continued substantial investment in r d is critical to maintaining a strong technological position in the industry 
since our antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas are manufactured using customized processes that require a substantial time to develop  our r d expenditures will probably always be higher as a percentage of net revenues than that of our major competitors using standard manufacturing processes 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a expenses in were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in sg a expenses in was due to decreased legal costs and settlements  which was partially off set by increased costs associated with the company s stock option investigation 
sg a expenses in included million in legal settlements resulting from the btr and zilog patent infringement claims 
costs associated with the company s stock option investigation were million in compared with million in stock based compensation expense under sfas r were million in compared with million in during fiscal  we incurred costs of million and million in connection with the settlement of two patent infringement claims brought against us 
sg a expenses also increased million in due to recognition of stock based compensation expense under sfas r 
sg a expenses in included legal and accounting costs of approximately million associated with the company s stock option investigation 
there were no such expenses recorded in sg a spending in increased as a percentage of sales over levels primarily as a result of the items noted above 
amortization of other acquisition related intangibles amortization of other acquisition related intangibles was in   in and million in the decrease in as compared with was attributable to intangible assets  related to an acquisition completed in the year  being fully amortized during the second quarter of interest income and other  net of expense interest income and other  net of expense  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for  our average investment portfolio return on investment was compared with in and in  resulting in higher interest income during fiscal as compared with prior years 
our average investment portfolio balance was million in compared with million in and million in we invest excess liquidity in investment portfolios consisting primarily of corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
in periods where market interest rates are falling  and for some time after rates stabilize  we typically experience declines in interest income and other as our older debt investments at higher interest rates mature and are replaced by new investments at the lower rates available in the market 
tax provision benefit significant components affecting the effective tax rate include pre tax net income or loss  federal r d tax credits  non deductible stock based compensation  the state composite tax rate  and adjustments to income taxes as a result of tax audits and reviews and recognition of certain deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowances 
our tax benefit for was million representing an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to non deductible stock based compensation partially offset by research tax credits and state tax benefits 
our tax provision for was million despite a pre tax loss of million 
this tax charge is primarily due to non deductible stock based compensation 
our tax provision for was million based upon a annual effective tax rate 
this rate was calculated based on a statutory tax rate benefited by r d tax credits and state tax benefits 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources our total assets were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease in total assets was attributable principally to decreases in cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and 
table of contents inventory 
the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated balance sheets expressed as the percentage change from december  to january  as of as of jan

 in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities cash  cash equivalents  and investments our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at the end of compared with million at the end of this decrease of million from the end of was due primarily to million of net cash provided by operating activities combined with million in cash provided by sales of available for sale securities  more than offset by million of cash used in financing activities  million used to purchase available for sale securities and million of cash used to purchase property and equipment 
cash provided by operating activities for included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million for non cash stock compensation  a charge of million against certain wafer prepayments  decreases in accounts receivable of million  and decreases in inventory of million 
these were partially off set by a net loss of million  decreases in accounts payable and other liabilities of million  increases in license agreements of million  and decreases in deferred income of million 
the decreases in accounts payable and other liabilities is primarily due to payments made under accrued license agreements and payments of accruals for legal settlements recorded in spending on property and equipment amounted to million in cash provided by operating activities for included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million for non cash stock compensation  decreases in accounts receivable of million  and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities of million 
these were partially off set by a net loss of million  increases in inventories of million  and increases in license agreements and other assets of million 
spending on property and equipment amounted to million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans amounted to in  million in  and million in we meet all of our funding needs for ongoing operations with internally generated cash flows from operations and with existing cash and short term investment balances 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the following twelve months 
a portion of available cash may be used for investment in or acquisition of complementary businesses  products  or technologies 
wafer manufacturers have at times demanded financial support from customers in the form of equity investments and advance purchase price deposits  which in some cases have been substantial 
should we require additional capacity  we may be required to incur significant expenditures to secure such capacity 

table of contents the following represents contractual commitments not accrued on the balance sheet associated with operating leases as of january  payments due by period total and later in thousands operating leases purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we believe that the availability of adequate financial resources is a substantial competitive factor 
to take advantage of opportunities as they arise  or to withstand adverse business conditions when they occur  it may become prudent or necessary for us to raise additional capital 
no assurance can be given that additional capital would become available on acceptable terms if needed 
accounts receivable our net accounts receivable was million at the end of compared with million at the end of this decrease is due mainly to improved collection efforts during the fiscal year end 
net accounts receivable represented days of sales outstanding at the end of fiscal compared with days at the end of fiscal we sell our products to distributors who resell our products to oems or their contract manufacturers 
our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us based on list price  which typically may be in excess of their ultimate cost as a result of agreements with the distributors allowing for price adjustments and credits 
accordingly  when a distributors resale is priced at a discount from list price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price  usually within days after the resale transaction has been reported to the company 
this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors since they are required to pay the full list price to actel and receive a subsequent discount only after the product has been sold to a third party 
as a consequence  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we have entered into written business arrangements with certain distributors whereby we issue advance credits to the distributors to minimize the adverse impact on the distributor s working capital 
the advance credits are updated and settled on a quarterly basis 
the advance credits have no impact on our revenue recognition since revenue from distributors is not recognized until the distributor sells the product but the advance credits do reduce our accounts receivable and our deferred income on shipments to distributors as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the amount of the advance credit as of january  was million 
inventories our net inventories were million at the end of compared with million at the end of we continue to hold material from last time buy inventory purchases made in  and from two wafer manufacturers for some of our mature product families 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and we believe that our then current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions is evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 

table of contents inventory at january  and december   included million and million  respectively  of inventory purchased in last time buys 
during  we recorded a write down against last time buy inventory of million 
no write down of last time buy material had been recorded in inventory days of supply  based on fourth quarter cost of sales  decreased from days at the end of to days at the end of our fpgas are manufactured using customized steps that are added to the standard manufacturing processes of our independent wafer suppliers  so our manufacturing cycle is generally longer and more difficult to adjust in response to changing demands or delivery schedules than our competitors using standard processes 
accordingly  our inventory levels will probably always be higher than that of our major competitors using standard processes 
property and equipment our net property and equipment was million at the end of compared with million at the end of we invested million in property and equipment in compared with million in capital expenditures during the past two years have been primarily for engineering  manufacturing  and office equipment 
depreciation of property and equipment was million in compared with million in goodwill our net goodwill was million at the end of both and there was a slight decrease in goodwill as a result of the realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards associated with the company s fiscal acquisition of gatefield 
we had originally established a valuation allowance for a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards acquired in connection with the acquisition of gatefield 
to the extent such valuation allowance is subsequently reversed as a result of the realization of the deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires that the offsetting credit is recognized first as a reduction of goodwill 
goodwill is recorded when consideration paid in an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
under sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairments tests during the fourth quarters of and  and noted no indicators of impairment 
other assets our other assets  net were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease was due primarily to a decrease of million in license agreements partially off set by million increase in deferred compensation plan assets 
current liabilities our total current liabilities were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease was due primarily to decreases in accrued license agreements of million and decreases in other liabilities of million

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and also require us to make the most difficult  complex and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based upon this definition  our most critical policies include revenue recognition  inventories  stock based compensation  legal matters and income taxes 
these policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  are discussed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or they are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  it could result in material expenses being recognized on the income statement 
revenues we sell our products to oems and to distributors who resell our products to oems or their contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on products sold to our oems upon shipment 
because sales to our distributors are generally made under agreements allowing for price adjustments  credits  and right of return under certain circumstances  we generally defer recognition of revenue on products sold to distributors until the products are resold by the distributor and price adjustments are determined  at which time our final net sales price is fixed 
deferred revenue net of the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded in the caption deferred income on shipments to distributors in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred income as a result of negotiated price concessions 
distributors resell our products to end customers at various negotiated price points which vary by end customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive pricing environments 
when a distributors resale is priced at a discount from list price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is complete 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
based upon historical trends and inventory levels on hand at each of our distributors as of january   we estimate that approximately million of the deferred income on shipments to distributors on the company s balance sheet as of january   will be credited back to the distributors in the future 
these amounts will not be recognized as revenue and gross margin in our statement of operations 
since we expect our distributors to turn their inventory balances five to six times a year  we expect that a majority of the inventory held by our distributors at the end of any quarter will be resold to end customers over the next two quarters 
revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been resold 
this reported information includes product resale price  quantity  and end customer information as well as inventory balances on hand 
our revenue reporting is dependent on us receiving timely and accurate data from our distributors 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data from our distributors and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventory and sell through activities 
because of the time involved in collecting  assimilating and analyzing the data provided by our distributors  we report actual sell through revenue one month in arrears 
this practice requires us to make an estimate of one month s distributor sell through activity at the end of each fiscal quarter 
this estimate is adjusted the following month to reflect actual sell through activity reported by our distributors 

table of contents inventories we believe that a certain level of inventory must be carried to maintain an adequate supply of product for customers 
this inventory level may vary based upon orders received from customers or internal forecasts of demand for these products 
other considerations in determining inventory levels include the stage of products in the product life cycle  design win activity  manufacturing lead times  customer demands  strategic relationships with foundries  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
should any of these factors develop other than anticipated  inventory levels may be materially and adversely affected 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
to address this difficult  subjective  and complex area of judgment  we apply a methodology that includes assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net realizable value 
first  we identify any inventory that has been previously written down in prior periods 
this inventory remains written down until sold  destroyed  or otherwise dispositioned 
second  we examine inventory line items that may have some form of non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards 
third  we assess the inventory not otherwise identified to be written down against product history and forecasted demand typically for the next six months 
finally  we analyze the result of this methodology in light of the product life cycle  design win activity  and competitive situation in the marketplace to derive an outlook for consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory valuation policies also take into consideration last time buy inventory purchases 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and we believe that our then current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
we made last time buys of certain products from our wafer suppliers in  and since this inventory was not acquired to meet current demand  we apply a discrete write down policy for inventory purchased in last time buy transactions and the related inventory are excluded from the standard excess and obsolescence write down policy 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions will be evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products over a longer time horizon  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
evaluations of last time buy inventory in resulted in write downs of million 
no write downs of last time buy material had been recorded in these write downs were taken because actual sell through results did not meet expectations or estimations of expected future demand 
legal matters and loss contingencies from time to time we are notified of claims  including claims that we may be infringing patents owned by others  or otherwise become aware of conditions  situations  or circumstances involving uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or the amount of a loss 
when probable and reasonably estimable  we make provisions for estimated liabilities 
as we sometimes have in the past  we may settle disputes and or obtain licenses under patents that we are alleged to infringe 
we can offer no assurance that any pending or threatened claim or other loss contingency will be resolved or that the resolution of any such claim or contingency will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
our failure to resolve a claim could result in litigation or arbitration  which can result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not determined in our favor 
actel is a nominal defendant in a consolidated shareholder derivative action filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against certain current and former officers and directors 
the company and the individual defendants intend to defend these cases vigorously 
in addition  our evaluation of the impact of these claims and contingencies could change based upon new information 
subject to the foregoing  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened legal claim or loss contingency is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position as of january   or results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year then ended 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary 
table of contents differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and  if necessary  we adjust the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we assessed our deferred tax assets at the end of and determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize approximately million of net deferred tax assets based upon our forecast of future taxable income and other relevant factors 
stock based compensation expense beginning january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior period s results 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the stock award 
we have determined that historical volatility is the best predictor of expected volatility and the expected term of our awards was determined taking into consideration the vesting period of the award  the contractual term and our historical experience of employee stock option exercise behavior 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we could change our assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate were materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense would be different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
further  sfas r requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected the straight line method as the basis for recording our expense 
the company recorded million and million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended january  and december   respectively 
as required by sfas r  management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
as of january   the total compensation cost related to options and nonvested stock granted to employees under the company s stock option plans but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of approximately million 
this cost will be amortized over a weighted average period of years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures 
as of january   the total compensation cost related to options to purchase shares of the company s common stock under the espp but not yet recognized was approximately million 
this cost will be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of asset backed obligations  corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  meet liquidity needs  and maximize yields 
to meet these objectives  we invest excess liquidity only in high credit quality debt securities with average maturities of less than two years 
we also limit the percentage of total investments that may be invested in any one issuer 
corporate investments as a group are also limited to a maximum percentage of our investment portfolio 
our investments in debt securities  which totaled million at january   are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase in interest rates could subject us to a decline in the market value of our investments 
these risks are mitigated by our ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to recover the carrying value of the investment which may not be until maturity 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates compared with interest rates at january   and december   would result in a reduction of approximately million and million in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities held at january   and december   respectively 
the potential changes noted above are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at january  actual results may differ materially
