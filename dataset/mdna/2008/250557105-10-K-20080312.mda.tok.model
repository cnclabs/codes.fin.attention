overview we are a retailer of distinctive modern design products to both residential and commercial customers 
our clients purchase through three integrated sales points 
approximately of our orders occur in our studios generating approximately of the dollar value of our order sales demand 
the remaining of our orders are transacted via our website and phone center 
we have developed a national presence in modern design furnishings and a brand recognized for design excellence among our customers and the design community 
in the process we have created a differentiated business model that enables us to provide products to our customers in a more convenient  efficient and economical manner than was previously available to them 
our policy of maintaining core products in stock represents a departure from the approach taken by many other modern design furnishings retailers 
in fiscal year  we introduced an extended lead time program  allowing our clients to personalize their product  if they wish to meet their unique needs 
based upon our success last year  we launched an expanded offering in accessories in the fourth quarter of  which we call tools for living 
we believe this new product line will increase our presence in providing modern design solutions for our customers 
this category currently features approximately new products  ranging in price from under to over  the products all share smart design  functionality and modern aesthetics 
each product is unique in how it solves a problem or makes something more comfortable or easier to use 
these products carry significantly better gross margins than our base business 
this as an opportunity to offer our existing customers a solution to their everyday problems  as well as providing an introduction to dwr for new clients 
if tools for living achieves a sufficient level of market acceptance  we will continue to grow the product line and explore other design driven opportunities 
our relationships with both internationally recognized and emerging designers continue to grow and allow us to offer our customers an array of innovative and often hard to find merchandise 
our business strategy is based upon the premise that multiple  integrated sales points improve customer convenience  reinforce brand awareness  enhance customer knowledge of our products and produce operational benefits that ultimately improve market penetration and returns on capital 
we believe most traditional retailers initially established their presence with one sales point and subsequently added additional sales points as they grow  thereby making integration across sales points more difficult 
we have experienced significant growth in customers and sales since our founding in we began selling products through the phone and online in the second half of  and we opened our first studio in november we base our decisions on where to open new studios by categorizing markets into tiers based on household population statistics and supporting sales data collected from our other sales points 
our experience indicates that studio openings significantly improve our overall market penetration rates in the markets in which they are located 
in addition  we have seen our online sales increase in markets where we have studios compared to markets where we do not have studios 
in recent years  we have continued to increase sales as our studio base grows 
studios have increased in number from one at the end of to studios and one outlet operating in states and the district of columbia as of december  during fiscal year  we opened three new studios and one replacement studio 
we expect to open between three and five new studios and two or three tools for living stores in fiscal  in major urban markets 
we have entered into leases for two of the studio locations as of december   that we expect to open in the first quarter of we expect to open the remaining locations late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 
table of contents we plan to reduce our catalog circulation in fiscal year however  our catalog related expense is expected to increase as a result of the postal increases enacted in late in the second quarter of fiscal  we will re launch our website on a new and improved platform 
we believe these enhancements to our web capabilities may provide us with significant future growth opportunities 
overall  our objectives for are to finish our turnaround  strengthen our expense controls and  most importantly  begin to realize the benefits of our re sourcing efforts 
all of our sales points utilize a single common inventory held at our hebron  kentucky fulfillment center 
because we don t offer a cash and carry option in our studios  we are able to more fully utilize selling space and avoid the operational issues that often arise with stock balancing and store replenishment 
we currently source our products primarily in the us and europe 
in fiscal year  we purchased approximately of our product inventories from manufacturers in foreign countries  with of our product inventory purchases being paid for in euros 
to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk  we purchased foreign currency contracts to pay for merchandise purchases 
as fiscal year progresses  we expect to have an increasing amount of products being sourced from factories outside of europe 
we plan to increase our efforts to develop products internally and include more exclusive items in our mix  and in doing so  source products in other parts of the world including latin america and asia where product costs are expected to be lower 
during the last twelve months  our product development team has worked diligently to find qualified factories in north america and elsewhere that can provide us with the quality our clients expect but free us from the impact of fluctuations in the price of the euro 
by the end of  we believe we can achieve significant product margin improvements from these efforts 
we believe that within five years we may have less than of our product coming from european factories 
on october   we shortened the estimated useful lives for certain computer systems costing approximately  from three years to months as a result of our plans to replace them 
this change resulted in additional depreciation expense in fiscal years and of approximately  and  respectively 
depreciation expense decreased by approximately  in fiscal year from as these assets became fully depreciated 
during fiscal year  we selected a software vendor  and during fiscal year  we began the process of implementing the new system 
during  we expect to install the new information technology systems and an enhanced website that will substantially increase depreciation expense

net sales consist of studio sales  online sales  phone sales  other sales and shipping and handling fees  net of actual and estimated returns by customers 
studio sales consist of sales of merchandise to customers from orders placed at our studios  online sales consist of sales of merchandise from orders placed through our website  phone sales consist of sales of merchandise through the toll free numbers associated with our printed catalogs  and other sales consist of warehouse sales and outlet sales 
warehouse sales consist of periodic clearance sales at our fulfillment center of product samples and products that customers have returned 
outlet sales consist of sales at our outlet of product samples  returned product from our customers and to a lesser degree full price product 
shipping and handling fees consist of amounts we charge customers for the delivery of merchandise 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in net sales is primarily related to a million increase in studio sales and a million increase in other sales 
the increase in sales is related to a higher average unit retail  in part due to price increases and product mix 
comparing fiscal year to fiscal year  the average order increased by approximately  partially offset by a decrease in the number of orders 
the increase in studio sales is attributable to the incremental sales of approximately million generated from seven studios opened in fiscal year which operated less than months in fiscal year and the three new studios opened during fiscal year in addition  the increase in studio sales is related to price increases and product mix as we sold more higher priced merchandise 
we had studios and one outlet open at the end of fiscal year compared to studios and one outlet open at the end of fiscal year we expect net sales to continue to increase in fiscal year  as we open additional studios including our new tools for living stores 
however  we cannot assure you that sales will increase due to uncertain economic conditions 
other sales increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
this increase in other sales is primarily related to an increase of million in sales generated from our outlet that opened at the end of the second quarter of this increase was partially offset by the decrease in warehouse sales of million primarily related to a large warehouse sales event in fiscal year that was not repeated in fiscal year online sales decreased by million  or  and phone sales decreased million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decreases in online and phone sales resulted from lower average orders and a decrease in the number of orders in fiscal year compared to fiscal year shipping and handling fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributed to our generally charging lower shipping and handling fees to our customers and eight free shipping promotions during fiscal year compared to four free shipping promotions during fiscal year 
table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in cost of sales is due to the increase in sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year cost of sales consists of cost of product sales and freight shipping costs 
of the percentage points decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales  percentage points is attributable to product related margin improvements and percentage points is attributed to lower freight shipping fees and costs in fiscal year compared to shipping fees decreased by and shipping costs decreased by in fiscal year compared to consequently  with product revenues increasing  shipping fees are a proportionally smaller component of revenues in fiscal year compared to resulting in an overall margin improvement of percentage points 
shipping margins remain a key ongoing focus for us 
we expect to break even in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of studio costs  including salaries and studio occupancy costs  costs associated with publishing our catalogs and maintaining our website  and corporate and fulfillment center costs  including salaries and occupancy costs  among others 
our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other companies because some other companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales  and others  including us  may exclude a portion of them from gross margin  including them instead in other line items  such as selling  general and administrative expenses

as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  which is primarily due to our increased sales 
changes in the components of sg a expenses are primarily due to the following salaries and benefits expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase is primarily related to a million increase in salary and contract labor expenses  a million increase in commission and bonus expense in part related to the increase in net sales  and a million increase in stock based compensation expense  partially offset by a million decrease in severance costs 
of the increase in salaries and benefits expenses noted above  approximately million is related to the seven studios and one outlet opened in fiscal year which operated less than months in fiscal year and the three new studios opened during fiscal year salaries and benefits expenses are expected to increase due to benefit cost increases  increased commissions related to planned sales increases  if any  and headcount increases from new studios not operating in the prior comparable period 
we may increase or decrease headcount depending on operating requirements and cost considerations that would affect salaries and benefits expenses 
occupancy and related expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in depreciation expense  of which million was related to our information technology system  which was fully depreciated in the first quarter of  partially offset by million increase in depreciation expense as a result of the change in the estimated useful life of assets related to the early termination of a studio lease 
this decrease was further offset by a million increase in rent and related operating expenses associated with the seven studios and one outlet opened in fiscal year which operated less than months in fiscal year and the three new studios opened during fiscal year occupancy and related expenses are expected to increase with the opening of new studios 
in addition  we anticipate increases in depreciation expense as our new information technology systems and enhanced website become operational in 
table of contents catalog  advertising and promotions expenses decreased approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily related to a million decrease in catalog expense and a million decrease in visual  prototypes and sample expenses  partially offset by a million increase in media advertising and promotions 
catalog expenditures during fiscal year were approximately  less per catalog than in fiscal year four catalogs were delivered to our customers in the fourth quarter of compared to three catalogs being delivered during the fourth quarter of  and the catalogs were delivered at later dates in compared to  resulting in less amortization expense prior to year end and higher prepaid catalog costs at year end 
other sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase is primarily due to a million increase in software and website related expenses  a million increase in sales related merchant fees and a million increase in studio distribution expense 
professional  accounting  legal and sox expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to a million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in accounting and consulting fees directly related to sec reporting and sox compliance  million decrease in legal expenses and a million decrease in public company reporting costs 
interest income 
interest income increased  to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher yielding investments in fiscal year compared with fiscal year invested capital in fiscal year was slightly lower than in during the third quarter of  we liquidated our municipal bonds portfolio and invested our capital in a higher yielding bank money market account 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher balances outstanding under our loan agreements in fiscal year compared with fiscal year other income  net 
other income primarily consists of a net gain of million after related expenses as a result of the early termination of a studio lease per an agreement between us and the landlord and list rental income of approximately  partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses of  income taxes 
in fiscal year  we recorded income tax expense of  compared to income tax benefit of  in fiscal year the income tax expense in fiscal year is primarily related to profitability in fiscal year compared to a net loss before tax benefit in fiscal year we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million as of december  for federal and state income taxes  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire between fiscal years and the effective tax rate for fiscal year was  which varies from the statutory rate primarily due to stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to incentive stock options which is not deductible for tax purposes and the effects of state income taxes 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase in net sales is primarily related to the million increase in studio sales  as well as the million increase in other sales 
the increase in studio sales is primarily attributable to the incremental sales of approximately million generated from studios opened in fiscal year which operated less than twelve months in fiscal year and approximately million in sales generated from seven studios opened during fiscal year other sales increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
this increase in other sales is primarily related to sales generated from three warehouse sales held during fiscal year and sales from our outlet which opened at the end of the second quarter of online sales increased million  or  and phone sales decreased million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we believe the increase in online sales is due in part to increased online marketing initiatives including search optimization and more strategic use of e mail databases  which increased the number of hits on our website by 
we had studios and one outlet open at the end of fiscal year compared to studios open at the end of fiscal year shipping and 
table of contents handling fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  primarily due to the free shipping events in the second and third quarter of fiscal year cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due primarily to the higher costs associated with shipping product from our distribution center  as well as a reduction in shipping revenue related to the free shipping promotions in the second and third quarter of fiscal year product related cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales excluding shipping and handling fees  remained relatively unchanged for fiscal year at compared to for fiscal year we believe that product related cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales excluding shipping and handling fees  is a useful financial measure as it removes the impact of shipping revenues and related costs 
we believe shipping operations do not reflect the core operations of our business and do not represent a profit center

our ability to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures in the future will depend on our future operations  performance and cash flows and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
commitments and contractual obligations on february   we entered into a loan  guaranty and security agreement with wells fargo retail finance  llc  or the loan agreement  which replaced the previous loan with wells fargo hsbc trade bank  na the loan agreement expires on february  and provides for an initial overall credit line up to  which may be increased to  at our option  provided we are not in default on the loan agreement 
the loan agreement consists of a revolving credit line and letters of credit up to  the amount we may borrow at any time under the loan agreement is based upon a percentage of eligible inventory and accounts receivable less certain reserves 
borrowings are secured by the right  title and interest to all of our personal property  including equipment  fixtures  general intangibles  intellectual property and inventory 
the loan agreement contains various restrictive covenants  including minimum availability  which is the amount we may borrow under the loan agreement  less certain outstanding obligations  plus certain cash and cash equivalents  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on subordinated indebtedness and limitations on the amount of capital expenditures we may incur in any fiscal year 
we are currently in compliance with all of these restrictive covenants 

table of contents interest on borrowings will be either at wells fargo s prime rate  or libor plus to based upon average availability and the unused credit line fee is 
in the event of default  our interest rates are increased by approximately two percentage points 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit line and  in outstanding letters of credit 
approximately  was available for advances under the revolving credit line as of december  we have various other notes payable  which consist primarily of unsecured equipment financing loans 
in june we financed a portion of our new information technology project with a three year promissory note of approximately million with an interest rate of approximately 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
interest on receivables and payables  or apb  we discounted this note to its fair value 
the discounted portion of approximately  is being amortized as interest expense over the life of the note using the effective interest method

purchase obligations primarily relate to commitments for inventory on open purchase orders 
off balance sheet arrangements through december   we did not have any relationships with entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below 

table of contents we operate on a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to december each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with an extra week added onto the fourth quarter every four to six years 
our fiscal year ended on december   the fiscal year ended on december  and the fiscal year ended on december  each of fiscal years  and consisted of weeks 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on the date on which we estimate that the product has been received by the customer 
we retain title to items and bear the risk of loss until delivery on shipments from our warehouse 
we take title to items drop shipped by vendors at the time of shipment and bear the risk of loss until delivery to customers 
we use third party freight carrier information to estimate standard delivery times to various locations throughout the united states 
we record as deferred revenue the dollar amount of all shipments for a particular day  if based upon our estimated delivery time  such shipments are expected to be delivered after the end of the reporting period 
as of december  and december   deferred revenue was  and  respectively  and related deferred cost of sales was  and  respectively 
deferred revenue was lower as of december  than december  because limited shipments were made during the last week of fiscal year due to a physical inventory being taken during that week 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold  and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
sales are recorded net of expected returns by customers 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with determining net sales recognized in any accounting period 
our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the returns allowance is recorded as a reduction to net sales for the estimated retail value of the projected product returns and as a reduction in cost of sales for the corresponding cost amount less any reserve for estimated scrap 
the reserves for estimated product returns were approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
inventory 
inventory consists primarily of finished goods purchased from third party manufacturers and estimated inbound freight costs 
inventory on hand is carried at an average cost which approximates a first in first out method and is carried at the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventory for estimated damage equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions or demand for our products are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
although our actual inventory write downs historically have not differed materially from estimated inventory write downs  in the future  actual inventory write downs may differ materially from our reserves 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of december  and december   we had inventory of  and  respectively  net of write downs of  and  respectively 
inventory in transit 
we record inventory in transit based upon purchase order amounts  shipping terms  and estimated lead times from our vendors to our freight forwarders 
actual amounts shipped could differ from our estimates due to transit times as well as partial shipments due to shortages or backorders 
inventory in transit was  as of december  and  as of december  accrued freight 
we estimate inbound and outbound freight costs based upon an analysis and review of our historical freight costs 
these costs may vary due to the actual weight and size of the product shipped as well as added fuel surcharges 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if such review indicates that the carrying amount of long lived assets is not recoverable  the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value 
management considers the following circumstances and events to assess the recoverability of carrying amounts a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which long lived assets are being used or in their physical condition  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  the long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
decisions to close a studio or facility also can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
when we close a location that is under a long term lease  we record a charge for the fair value of the liability associated with that lease at the cease use date 
the fair value of such liability is calculated based on the remaining lease rental payments due under the lease  reduced by estimated rental payments that could be reasonably obtained by us for subleasing the property to a third party 
the estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future studio profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  a loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
advertising costs 
direct response catalog costs consist of third party costs  including paper  printing  postage  name acquisition and mailing costs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog costs and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon weighted average historical revenues attributed to previously issued catalogs 
based on historical data we have collected  we have estimated that catalogs have a period of expected future benefit of two to four months 
the period of expected future benefit of our catalogs could decrease if we were to publish new catalogs more frequently in each year  or could increase if we published them less frequently 
prepaid catalog costs are evaluated for realizability at the end of each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future net benefit associated with that catalog 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated probable remaining future net benefit of the catalog  the excess is expensed in the reporting period 
we account for consideration received from our vendors for co operative advertising as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense 
co operative advertising amounts received from such vendors were approximately   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
apart from amounts received from vendors for cooperative advertising  we do not typically receive allowances or credits from vendors 
in the case of a few select vendors  we receive a small discount of approximately for prompt payment of invoices 
these discounts were recorded as a reduction of costs of goods sold and totaled   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
stock based compensation 
in the first quarter of  we adopted the modified prospective method for valuing stock options we grant in accordance with sfas r 
under sfas r  we recognized  and  of compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases in fiscal years and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is classified in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we calculate the value of each employee stock option  estimated on the date of grant  using the black scholes model 
the following assumptions are used in the model a blended volatility rate using a combination of historical stock prices of the company and volatility data from four publicly traded retail industry peers  a risk free interest rate based upon the closing rates on the date of grant for us treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option  a dividend yield based on historical and expected dividend payouts  an expected life of employee stock options based on the simplified method allowed by the sec s office of the chief accountant and divisions of corporation finance and investment management staff accounting bulletin and a forfeiture rate based on historical data 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to adopting sfas r  we recorded deferred stock based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise prices of certain options were less than the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by the provisions of apb 
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  and  to realize federal and state net operating losses  respectively 
we record an estimated valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have provided a valuation allowance to the extent that our deferred tax assets are deemed not realizable 
the valuation allowance was  as of december  derivative and hedging activities 
we record derivatives related to cash flow hedges for foreign currency at fair value on our balance sheet  including embedded derivatives 
we implemented a new hedging strategy in the first quarter of to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on inventory purchases 
foreign currency contracts entered into from january to april of fiscal year were not designated as cash flow hedge contracts and were being accounted for using this non cash flow hedge accounting 
since we did not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting  we accounted for foreign currency contracts using non cash flow hedge accounting on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss in other income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of open contracts to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in other income loss 
in the second quarter of  we developed a hedging strategy and policies and procedures that met the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
foreign currency contracts entered into from may through december were designated as cash flow hedge contracts and were accounted for on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss in other comprehensive income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of open designated contracts to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in other comprehensive income loss 
net cash settlement gain or loss was recognized in cost of sales as the underlying hedged inventory is sold in each reporting period 
our derivative positions were used only to manage identified exposures 
we evaluated hedges for effectiveness  and for derivatives that were deemed ineffective  the ineffective portion was reported through earnings 
we did not record any amounts for ineffectiveness during fiscal year we recorded approximately  and  for ineffectiveness during fiscal year and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
most of the provisions in sfas are elective  however  the amendment to sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
the fair value option established by sfas permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab sab amends and replaces question of section d 
of topic  share based payment  of the staff accounting bulletin series 
question of section d 
of topic expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options and allows usage of the simplified method for share option grants prior to december  sab allows public companies which do not have historically sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate to continue to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of plain vanilla share option grants after december  we are required to adopt sab on january  we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term in accordance with sab in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas r retains the underlying concepts of sfas in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting but sfas r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december  we are currently evaluating this new statement and anticipate that this statement will not have a significant impact on the reporting of our results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
we are currently evaluating this new statement and anticipate that this statement will not have a significant impact on the reporting of our results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk in fiscal year  we generated all of our net sales in us dollars  but we purchased approximately of our product inventories from manufacturers in foreign countries with of our product inventory purchases being paid for in euros 
increases and decreases in the us dollar relative to the euro result in fluctuations in the cost to us of merchandise sourced from europe 
as a result of such currency fluctuations  we have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis going forward 
specifically  as the value of the us dollar declines relative to the euro  our effective cost of supplies of product increases 
as a result  declines in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and other foreign currencies would increase our cost of goods sold and decrease our gross margin 
although our hedging strategy described below may mitigate this risk in the short term  currency fluctuations in the long term will not be mitigated by hedging because we do not hedge our currency risks beyond a year 
in the long term  we may mitigate the affect of currency fluctuations on our gross margins by increasing prices 
however  increasing prices adversely affects sales volume 
in fiscal year  the value of the dollar decreased approximately relative to the euro 
we implemented a new hedging strategy in the first quarter of to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on inventory purchases 
foreign currency contracts entered into from january to april were not designated as cash flow hedge contracts and were being accounted for using this non cash flow hedge accounting 
since we did not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting  we accounted for foreign currency contracts using non cash flow hedge accounting on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss in other income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of open contracts to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in other income loss 
in the second quarter of  we developed a hedging strategy and policies and procedures that met the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
foreign currency contracts entered into from may through december were designated as cash flow hedge contracts and were accounted for on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss in other comprehensive income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of open designated contracts to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in other comprehensive income loss 
net cash settlement gain or loss was recognized in cost of sales as the underlying hedged inventory is sold in each reporting period 
our derivative positions were used only to manage identified exposures 
if our hedging strategy does not help reduce fluctuations in our cost of goods and mitigate the impact of strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar  we will continue to have difficulties in accurately predicting our costs of goods and our cost of goods may increase  adversely impacting our gross margin 
interest rate risk we have interest payable on our revolving line of credit 
amounts borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lender s prime lending rate or libor plus to based upon average availability 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the future financing requirements 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this facility
