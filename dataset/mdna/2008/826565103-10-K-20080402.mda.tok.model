item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
except for historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of overview we are a leading fabless provider of highly integrated system on chip  or soc  solutions that are used to deliver multimedia entertainment throughout the home 
our soc solutions combine our semiconductors and software and are a critical component of multiple high growth  consumer applications that process digital video and audio content  including iptv  high definition dvd players  hdtvs  and portable media players 
our semiconductors provide high definition digital video decoding for multiple compression standards  graphics acceleration  audio decoding  a cpu and display control 
our software provides control of media processing and system security management 
together  our semiconductors and software form a complete soc solution that we believe provides our customers with a foundation to quickly develop feature rich consumer entertainment products 
we believe we are the leading provider of digital media processor socs for set top boxes in the iptv market and a leading provider of such socs for the high definition dvd player market  in terms of units shipped 
our primary target markets are the iptv  the high definition dvd and other media players and the hdtv markets 
the iptv market consists of consumer and commercial products that distribute and receive streaming video using internet protocol  or ip 
the high definition dvd and other media players market consists primarily of set top boxes and portable media products that perform playback of digital media stored on optical or hard disk formats 
the hdtv product market consists of digital television sets offering high definition capability 
we also sell products into other markets such as the pc based add in market 
although we no longer specifically target them  we continue to derive revenue from sales of our products into these markets 
our primary product group consists of our soc solutions 
to a much lesser extent  we provide other products  such as customized development boards 
for fiscal and  we derived and  respectively  of our net revenue from our soc solutions 
our soc solutions consist of highly integrated semiconductors and software that process digital video and audio content 
our net revenue from sales of our soc solutions increased million  or  from fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in our socs sales in fiscal was in part attributable to many of our customers commercially launching products incorporating our socs after successful initial trials 
we began volume shipments in january of our smp series  which is our latest soc solution for these markets 
this product series represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal we believe our success with the smp series product demonstrates our success in the emerging iptv and high definition dvd player markets 
as a result of increased customer adoption  our net revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  representing growth of we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our customers and receive substantially all of our net revenue based on purchase orders 
we forecast demand for our products based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers  but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our customers serve 
we work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
however  a failure by us to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers 
many of our target markets are characterized by intense price competition 
in addition  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and  as a result  we expect our average selling prices to decline over time 
to date  we have not experienced significant competitive pricing pressures with respect to our soc solutions in our primary target markets 
however  on occasion  we have reduced our prices for individual customer volume orders as part of our strategy to obtain a competitive position in our target markets 
the willingness of customers to design our socs into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices  volume order discounts  mix of product sales  our costs  the extent of development fees  changes in estimated useful lives of production testing equipment and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
in october  we completed a follow on public offering in which we sold and issued  shares of our common stock at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the follow on public offering  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other direct offering costs of million 
tender offer to amend the exercise price of certain options on may   we filed a tender offer statement on schedule to with the sec and commenced an offer  which we refer to as the offer  to amend certain options granted under our amended and restated stock plan or our employee stock option plan that had original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the option on the option s measurement date for financial reporting purposes and were unvested as of december   which we refer to as the a affected options 
under the terms of the offer  individuals eligible to participate in the offer must have been a a non executive employee of the company or one of its subsidiaries as of the date on which the offer commenced and on june   the date on which the offer expired  b subject to federal income tax in the united states  and c holding section a affected options grants that were unvested as of december  our executive officers and directors were not eligible to participate in the offer 
options that were eligible for amendment under the offer are referred to below as eligible options 
the terms of the offer provided that employees could elect to have eligible options amended to increase their exercise price per share to be equal to the fair market value used for financial reporting purposes and to receive a cash payment with respect to such amended options equal to the difference between the amended exercise price and the original exercise price of each eligible option  less applicable withholding taxes 
the cash payments were made on the first payroll date following january   regardless of whether the holder of the amended eligible option remained employed with us on the actual cash payment date 
we received election forms from eligible employees agreeing to amend and increase to fair value the exercise price with respect to approximately million shares underlying eligible options 
under the terms of the offer  we made cash payments in january totaling approximately million to the individuals  who amended their eligible options  which were accrued for in the second quarter of fiscal for those employees who exercised a a affected option during  we are participating in the irs and the california franchise tax board  or ftb  settlement programs they developed to allow employers to pay certain taxes on behalf of employees to settle potential tax liabilities resulting from the exercise of these a affected options during in connection with our participation in these programs  we paid an aggregate of approximately million to the irs and ftb 
we also approved bonuses of an aggregate of approximately million payable to these affected employees to compensate them for additional income tax imposed on them as a result of the payments we made on their behalf to the irs and ftb 
share repurchase program on february   we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
on march   we announced that our board of directors had approved an increase of  additional shares to the program  resulting in a total amount authorized to be repurchased under the share repurchase program of  shares 
the amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors  including management s discretion 
repurchases may be conducted in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and the repurchase program may be modified  extended or terminated by the board of directors at any time 
there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased under the program 
as of april   we had purchased a cumulative total of approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to the repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of million at an average price of per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from three principal sources product sales  product development contracts and service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue for product sales and service contracts in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  under which revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as shipping terms are fob shipping point  except that revenue is deferred when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectability is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable 
allowances for sales returns  discounts and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenue is recognized 
product development agreements typically require that we provide customized software to support customer specific designs  accordingly  this revenue is accounted for under the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
we offer post contract customer support pcs on a contractual basis for additional fees  which is typically a one year term 
in instances where software is bundled with the pcs  vendor specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement and  therefore  revenue and related costs are deferred until all elements  except pcs  are delivered 
the total fee is then recognized ratably over the pcs term typically one year after the software is delivered 
we classify development costs related to product development agreements as cost of revenue 
revenue from service contracts consist of fees for providing engineering support services  and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
expenses related to support service revenue are included in cost of revenue 
accounting for income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax credits and net operating losses available for carry forwards and significant temporary differences 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non current based upon the classification of the related asset or liability in the financial statements or the expected timing of their reversal if they do not relate to a specific asset or liability 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion of  or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to the entity as enacted by the relevant tax authorities 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no  accounting for income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in entities financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted the provisions of fin on february  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost approximating a first in  first out basis or market value 
we periodically review our inventories for excess and obsolete inventory items and adjust carrying costs to estimated net realizable values when we determine they are less than cost 
this review requires an estimation of the future demand for our products and these adjustments are recorded when the inventory on hand exceeds our estimate of future demand for each product  generally for a period of one year 
once the inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product 
a provision is recorded for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower costed inventory is subsequently sold  the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
share based compensation on january   the start of our fiscal  we adopted sfas r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended february  and february  reflect the impact of sfas r 
however  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods do not include the impact of sfas r 
accordingly  prior periods do not include equity compensation amounts comparable to those included in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended february  and february we have elected to adopt fasb staff position fsp fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards to calculate our pool of windfall tax benefits 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to january   we accounted for share based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
as permitted under sfas no 
and further amended by sfas no 

upon adoption of sfas r  we reassessed our equity compensation valuation method and related assumptions 
our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant utilizes an option pricing model  and is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended february  and february  included a combination of payment awards granted prior to january  and payment awards granted subsequent to january  for share based payment awards granted prior to january   we attribute the value of share based compensation  determined under sfas r  to expense using the accelerated multiple option approach 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to january  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
share based compensation expense included in the years ended february  and february  includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the adoption of sfas r requires us to reflect the net cumulative impact of estimating forfeitures in the determination of period expense by reversing the previously recognized cumulative compensation expense related to those forfeitures  rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 
we did not record this cumulative impact upon adoption  as the amount was insignificant 
stock options granted in periods prior to were measured based on sfas requirements  whereas stock options granted subsequent to january  were measured based on sfas r requirements 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities include primarily auction rate securities and corporate commercial paper and bonds 
we monitor all securities for impairment and recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of these marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a bidding process sometimes referred to as a dutch auction 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities resets periodically  at intervals set at the time of issuance eg  twenty eight  thirty five days or forty two days  etc  based on the market demand at the reset period 
these securities are generally classified as short term marketable securities due to the auction reset feature and liquidity presumably provided at each scheduled auction date 
however  if auction rate securities fail to clear at the reset auction and we are unable to estimate the date the auction rate securities will next clear  they are classified as long term marketable securities consistent with their stated contractual maturities 
at february  we held ten auction rate securities  with a cost of million  all of which failed to clear at recent auctions 
we do not expect to incur other than temporary declines in value associated with these auction rate securities and has classified all auction rate securities held at february  as long term marketable securities consistent with their stated maturities which range from to years 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
if any of these events were to happen  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expenses 
accounts receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers may have difficulty with their cash flows 
certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments beyond the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the account receivable they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate whether collectibility is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding their credit worthiness 
in establishing our sales return allowance  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  and  we recorded provisions for bad debt allowance and sales returns in the total amounts of million   and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required

this was in part attributable to our customers in the iptv market continuing to increase sales of their products that incorporate our socs  primarily our smp soc series 
our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by primarily due to expansion of the iptv market and increased sales to existing customers as well sales to new customers 
for fiscal  revenue from sales of our soc solutions into the iptv market increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in revenue in the iptv market for fiscal as compared to fiscal was in part attributable to our customers commercially launching their products incorporating our socs  primarily our smp series 
our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by primarily due to expansion of the iptv market and increased sales to existing customers as well sales to new customers 
we expect our revenue from the iptv market to fluctuate in future periods as this revenue is based on iptv service deployments by telecommunication service providers 
high definition dvd and other media players for fiscal  revenue from sales of our products to the high definition dvd and other media players market increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume of our customers products incorporating our socs  including an increase in blu ray and digital media adapter applications 
however  for this period our percentage of net revenue from sales into the high definition dvd and other media players market decreased as a percentage of our total revenue  primarily due to a disproportionate increase in the sales of our products into the iptv market 
for fiscal  revenue from sales of our products to the high definition dvd and other media player market increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of our customers products  including an increase in blu ray and digital media adapter applications 
however  for this period our percentage of net revenue from sales into the high definition dvd and other media players market decreased as a percentage of our total revenue  primarily due to a disproportionate increase in the sales of our products into the iptv market 
hdtv for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the hdtv market increased by million  or  from fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an overall increase in demand for our hdtv applications 
our net revenues from sales into the hdtv market as a percentage of our total net revenues from fiscal compared to fiscal remained flat due to a disproportionate increase in the sales of our products into the iptv market 
other our other markets consist of pc add ins and other ancillary markets 
net revenue increased million  or from fiscal to fiscal and million  or from fiscal to fiscal these increases were primarily attributable to an increase in nonrecurring engineering and service revenues 
net revenue by product group our primary product group consists of our soc solutions 
to a lesser extent we derive net revenues from other products and services 
the following table sets forth net revenue in each of our product groups and the percentage of net revenue represented by each product group in thousands years ended february  of february  of january  of net revenue net revenue net revenue socs other net revenue socs our socs are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume designer and manufacturer customers building products for the iptv  high definition dvd and other media players and hdtv consumer electronic markets 
the increase of million  or  in net revenue from socs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in sales of our soc solutions into newer generation iptv products and high definition dvd players 
the increase of million  or  in net revenue from socs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in sales into the newer generation of iptv  high definition dvd players and other media players and hdtv products  offset by a million decrease in sales of our legacy products 
other we derive net revenue from other products and services  including engineering support services for both hardware and software  engineering development for customization of socs and other accessories 
the slight increase in our net revenue from other products in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to increases in sales of our engineering development kits related to our socs and increases in support services as a result of our increased soc sales  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our board products as a result of decreased demand 
the decrease of million  or  in net revenue from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased demand for our board products 
we anticipate our net revenue from board products will be relatively flat or decrease in future periods due to our strategic decision to focus on our soc solutions 
net revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our net revenue by geographic region and the percentage of net revenue represented by each geographic region based on the invoicing location of each customer in thousands years ended february  of february  of january  of net revenue net revenue net revenue asia europe north america other regions net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
asia our net revenue from asia increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the revenue from asia increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our net revenue were due primarily to our customers continued expansion of their products incorporating our socs 
also  companies who incorporate our products into their finished goods and are located in other regions continued to move their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region  which has led to a further shifting of our net revenue from other regions into the asia region  as many of our direct customers are large designers and manufacturers located in asia 
we also continued to experience large volume orders from two distributors located in asia 
the increase in net revenue from the asia region in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to completion of our customers initial product trials and successful launches of end products that contain our socs 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue from countries in the asia region that accounted for over of net revenue years ended february  february  january  singapore korea japan china taiwan net revenue from this region was less than of our net revenue 
europe our net revenue from europe for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal and for fiscal  our net revenue increased million  or  as compared to fiscal the increases in net revenue from europe were primarily attributable to major deployments by our european customers using our socs in their iptv set top boxes 
our net revenue from europe in any given period fluctuates depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through their overseas manufacturers who incorporate our socs into their final products 
for fiscal  our revenue in france was of our net revenue 
for fiscal  revenue in france was of our net revenue 
no other european country accounted for more than of our net revenue in fiscal and for fiscal  we did not have revenue in excess of of our net revenue from a single european country 
north america our net revenue from north america increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to increased demand for our soc solutions for the iptv market 
however  our net revenue from north america as a percentage of our net revenue declined from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of the continuation of the trend of companies located in north america who incorporate our products into their finished products moving their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region 
our revenue from north american increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was largely due to our customers initial trails and successful launches of their products that incorporate our socs 
our revenue from north america in any given period fluctuates depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through overseas manufacturers who incorporate our products into their final products 
in fiscal  our net revenue generated outside north america was of our net revenue as compared to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that net revenue outside of north america will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue

gross profit and gross margin the following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin in thousands years ended february  february  january  change change gross profit gross margin our gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant increases in gross profit in fiscal and were due primarily to increased sales of our socs used in the iptv and high definition dvd and other media player markets 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of net revenue were million in  million in fiscal and  in fiscal our gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily related to the reduction of our product costs as we achieved increased unit production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies with our manufacturers 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily related to the introduction of our socs for the iptv market at lower average selling prices due to individual customer volume pricing  while incurring early volume production ramp costs

the million increase in share based compensation expense includes million in compensation expense associated with research and development personnel as a result of the employee stock option tender offer we initiated in the second quarter of fiscal in addition to an increase in headcount 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to the addition of research and development personnel  partially offset by a reduction in project related costs of million 
we anticipate research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation expenses primarily as a result of increased headcount of nine sales and marketing employees from fiscal to fiscal and variable selling costs  such as commissions  due to increased sales  an increase of million in share based compensation expense  an increase of million in professional services  an increase of million in travel and entertainment expenses and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization and rent expenses 
the million increase in share based compensation expense includes million in compensation expense associated with sales and marketing personnel as a result of the employee stock option tender offer we initiated in the second quarter of fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase in fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in commission expenses paid in fiscal and an increase of million in share based compensation attributable to our sales and marketing personnel  partially offset by a decrease in sales and marketing personnel 
we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation expenses primarily as a result of increased headcount of three general and administrative employees from fiscal to fiscal  an increase of million in legal fees related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices of prior years  an increase of million in share based compensation expense  an increase of million in professional fees related to audit  tax and other services and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization  rent and other miscellaneous expenses 
the million increase in share based compensation expense includes million in compensation expense associated with general and administrative personnel as a result of the employee stock option tender offer we initiated in the second quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in outside professional services  an increase of million in compensation expenses associated with general and administrative personnel and an increase of million in share based compensation attributable to our general and administrative personnel 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
share based compensation expenses the following table sets for the total share based compensation expense  excluding tender offer payments associated with the adjustments to measurement dates for option grants  that is included in each functional line item in the consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended february  february  january  cost of revenue research and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses total share based compensation the amounts included in fiscal and reflect the adoption of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal has not been restated to reflect  and does not include  the impact of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r will continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
the amount of unearned share based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in the period fiscal through related to unvested share based payment awards at february  is million 
the weighted average period over which the unearned share based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with any acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million and million for acquired developed technology for fiscal and  respectively  is classified as cost of sales 
amortization expense of million and million for other purchased intangible assets for fiscal and  respectively  is classified as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
at february   the unamortized balance from purchased intangible assets was million which will be amortized to future periods based on their respective remaining estimated useful lives 
if we purchase additional intangible assets in the future  our cost of revenue or other operating expenses will increase by the amortization of those assets 
gains on sale of long term investment we recognized no gain on sales of long term investments in fiscal or and we recognized gains totaling million on sales of long term investments in fiscal during fiscal  we sold our investment in series b preferred stock of a local mpeg system provider for approximately million 
we had no carrying amount for this investment at the date of sale  as it had been fully written off in fiscal the entire sales proceeds of approximately million were recognized as a gain on sales of investment during the year

at february   we held approximately million of investments  currently classified in our long term marketable securities  with an auction reset feature  which are referred to as auction rate securities 
in late february and march  auctions failed for all of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed  and as a result our ability to liquidate our investments and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity at february  we held money market funds of million  short term marketable securities of million and long term marketable securities of million 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these money market funds and marketable securities would not have a significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
at february   we held approximately million of investments  currently classified in our long term marketable securities  with an auction reset feature  which are referred to as auction rate securities 
in late february and march  auctions failed for all of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that future auctions will succeed and as a result our ability to liquidate our investments and fully recover the carrying value of our marketable securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failure  were rated aaa or aaa at the time of purchase  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
if the issuers of these auction rate securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these marketable securities 
we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our auction rate securities have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments 
we are continuing to evaluate the credit quality  classification and valuation of our auction rate securities  however  we are not yet able to quantify the amount of impairment  if any  or change in classification in these investments at this time 
if these auctions continue to fail and the credit ratings of these investments deteriorate  the fair value of these auction rate securities may decline and we may incur impairment charges in connection with these securities  which would negatively affect our reported earnings  cash flow and financial condition 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the hong kong dollar and euro are the financial currencies of our subsidiaries in hong kong and france  respectively 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposures or intercompany balances against movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rate at february   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an insignificant amount
