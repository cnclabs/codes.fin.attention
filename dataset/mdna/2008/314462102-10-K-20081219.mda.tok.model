item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company manufactures  markets and sells the fc female condom  the only fda approved product under a woman s control which provides dual protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases  including hiv aids 
during  the company began development of its second generation female condom  fc  which was completed in in august   after a stringent technical review  the world health organization cleared it for purchase by un agencies 
the first substantial sales of fc occurred in the second quarter of fiscal the company submitted a pma with the fda for fc in january the fda s ob gyn device advisory committee unanimously voted at its december  meeting that the company s second generation female condom  the fc female condom  is approvable with a single condition 
the condition is that the fc female condom s instructions for use continue to follow use instructions for the fc female condom and appropriately identify the study that was performed to establish the comparable safety and effectiveness of fc with fc 
the fda is not bound by the committee s recommendation  but it takes its advice into consideration when completing its review of obstetric and gynecologic devices 
if the fda determines the fc female condom approvable  the final step will be to confirm the package labeling and directions 
the company believes that fc will result in a significant reduction in production costs and accelerate growth through the lower price product 
revenues 
most of the company s revenues are derived from sales of the female condom  its only product  and are recognized upon shipment of the product to its customers 
beginning in fiscal  revenue is also being derived from licensing its intellectual property to its business partner in india  hindustan latex limited 
such revenue appears as royalties on the audited consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  the company s strategy is to develop a global market and distribution network for its product by maintaining relationships with public sector groups and completing partnership arrangements with companies with the necessary marketing and financial resources and local market expertise 
the company s customers include the following the company sells the female condom to the global public sector under the umbrella of its agreement with unaids 
this agreement facilitates the availability and distribution of the female condom at a reduced price based on the company s cost of production 
the current price per unit ranges between and british pounds sterling  or approximately to  depending on contractual volumes 
currently  the female condom is available in over countries through public sector distribution 
the company sells fc to the us agency for international development usaid for use in usaid prevention programs in developing countries 
the company sells the female condom in the united states to city and state public health clinics as well as not for profit organizations such as planned parenthood 
the company markets fc directly in the united kingdom 
the company has distribution agreements with commercial partners which market directly to consumers in countries  including the united states  brazil  canada  mexico  spain  france  japan and india 
these agreements are generally exclusive for a single country 
under these agreements  the company manufactures and sells the female condom to the distributor partners  who  in turn market and distribute the product to consumers in the established territory 
occasionally  significant quarter to quarter variations may occur due to the timing and shipment of large orders  not from any fundamental change in the company s business 
because the company manufactures fc in a leased facility located in london  england and fc in a leased facility located in malaysia  a portion of the company s operating costs are denominated in foreign currencies 
while a material portion of the company s future sales are likely to be in foreign markets  all sales are denominated in either british pounds sterling or united states dollars 
manufacturing costs and sales to foreign markets are subject to normal currency risks associated with changes in the exchange rate of british pounds sterling relative to the united states dollar 
since the malaysian ringgit myr is historically quite stable against the dollar  the foreign exchange impact of myr versus british pounds gbp is negligible as the uk subsidiary s financial statements are converted to us dollars 
on an ongoing basis  management continues to evaluate the company s commercial transactions and is prepared to employ currency hedging strategies when it believes such strategies are appropriate 
expenses 
the company manufactures fc at its facility located in the united kingdom and fc at its facility located in selangor de  malaysia 
the company s cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct material costs  direct labor costs and indirect production and distribution costs 
direct material costs include raw materials used to make the female condom  principally polyurethane for fc and a nitrile polymer for fc indirect product costs include logistics  quality control  and maintenance expenses  as well as costs for helium  nitrogen  electricity and other utilities 
all of the key components for the manufacture of the female condom are essentially available from either multiple sources or multiple locations within a source 
the company has experienced increased costs of products  supplies  salaries and benefits  and increased general and administrative expenses 
in both and  the company has increased selling prices wherever possible to offset such cost increases 
as noted above  the company s manufacturing costs are subject to currency risks associated with changes in the exchange rate of british pounds sterling relative to the united states dollar 
to date  the company s management has not deemed it appropriate to utilize currency hedging strategies to manage its currency risks 
a decrease of the value of the us dollar compared to british pounds sterling has the effect of increasing the company s cost of sales and decreasing its gross profit margin 
when the dollar strengthens against the pound  the opposite impact occurs

the company has recorded a tax benefit in the amount of  during the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september  as a result of the decrease in the valuation allowance on these assets 
factors that may affect operating results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to increase demand for the female condom and to cost effectively manufacture sufficient quantities of the female condom 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future results and improve its financial condition 
reliance on a single product the company expects to derive the vast majority  if not all  of its future revenues from the female condom  its sole current product 
while management believes the global potential for the female condom is significant  the ultimate level of consumer demand around the world is not yet known 
distribution network the company s strategy is to develop a global distribution network for the female condom by entering into partnership arrangements with financially secure companies with appropriate marketing expertise 
this strategy has resulted in numerous in country distributions in the public sector  particularly in africa  latin america and recently india 
the company has also entered into several partnership agreements for the commercialization of the female condom in consumer sector markets around the world 
however  the company is dependent on country governments  global donors  as well as us municipal and state public health departments to continue aids hiv std prevention programs that include female condoms as a component of such programs 
the company s commercial market penetration is dependent on its ability to identify appropriate business partners who will effectively market and distribute the female condom within its contractual territory 
failure by the company s partners to successfully market and distribute the female condom or failure of donors and or country governments to establish and sustain hiv aids prevention programs which include distribution of female condoms  the company s inability to secure additional agreements with global aids prevention organizations  or the company s inability to secure agreements in new markets  either in the public or private sectors  could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
inventory and supply all of the key components for the manufacture of the female condom are essentially available from either multiple sources or multiple locations within a source 
global market and foreign currency risks the company manufactures fc in a leased facility located in london  england and fc in a leased facility located in malaysia 
a material portion of the company s future sales are likely to be in foreign markets 
manufacturing costs and sales to foreign markets are subject to normal currency risks associated with changes in the exchange rate of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
on an ongoing basis  management continues to evaluate its commercial transactions and is prepared to employ currency hedging strategies when it believes such strategies are appropriate 
in addition  some of the company s future international sales may be in developing nations where dramatic political or economic changes are possible 
such factors may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation the female condom is subject to regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  and by other state and foreign regulatory agencies 
under the fdc act  medical devices must receive fda clearance before they can be sold 
fda regulations also require the company to adhere to certain good manufacturing practices  which include testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
the company s compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
the failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines  delays or suspensions of clearances  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  withdrawal of fda approval and criminal prosecutions 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a withdrawal of approval from the fda or a failure by fda to approve  or a significant delay of approval by the fda of fc liquidity and sources of capital in  the company s operations consumed cash of million primarily due to the timing of collection of accounts receivable 
in fiscal year  the company generated million in positive cash flow from operations 
investing activities consumed million  primarily in purchasing fixed assets 
financing activities consumed a net of million  million was used to repurchase stock  million generated by stock option and warrant exercises  and consumed by preferred dividend and capital lease payments 
cash flows from operations  investing activites and financing activites together with an million negative currency exchange rate impact resulted in a positive cash flow of million in fiscal in earlier years  the company funded operating losses and capital requirements  in large part  through the sale of preferred stock  common stock or debt securities convertible into common stock 
at september   the company had working capital of million and stockholders equity of million compared to working capital of million and stockholders equity of million as of september the company believes its current cash position is adequate to fund operations of the company in the near future  although no assurances can be made that such cash will be adequate 
however  if needed  the company may sell equity securities to raise additional capital and may borrow funds under its heartland bank credit facility 
presently  the company has two revolving notes with heartland bank that allow the company to borrow up to  these notes expire on july  these notes were extended under the same terms as the initial notes dated may   with the exception of the interest rate which has been reduced to prime plus 
prime rate was at september  
no new warrants were issued as part of the extension of these notes 
these notes are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving notes at september  as of december   the company had approximately million in cash  net trade accounts receivable of million and current trade accounts payable of million 
presently  the company has no required debt service obligations

in and the company has  where possible  increased selling prices to offset such increases in costs
