table of contents part i item business overview we are a leading dedicated security technology company that secures systems and networks from known and unknown threats around the world 
we empower home users  businesses  government agencies  service providers and our partners with the ability to block attacks  prevent disruptions  and continuously track and improve their security 
security has emerged as one of the most critical concerns facing businesses and consumers 
security breaches have risen dramatically in the past few years  fueled in part by the proliferation of mobile devices such as laptop computers  cell phones and smart phones with email and web surfing capabilities 
for corporations  the increasing frequency of security breaches has coincided with expanding regulatory compliance requirements relating to security and more specifically  to privacy 
failure to comply with these requirements  and with the requirements of internal security policies and procedures  creates an additional level of enterprise risk 
for consumers  online fraud and security concerns increasingly discourages customers from transacting online for example  visiting and purchasing from e commerce sites  using online banking services and preparing taxes online 
all of these trends point toward a growing demand for effective security solutions 
our approach and offerings we apply business discipline and a pragmatic approach to security that is based on four principles of security risk management i identify and prioritize assets  ii determine acceptable risk  iii protect against threats and iv enforce and measure compliance 
we incorporate some or all of these principles into our solutions 
our solutions protect systems and networks by blocking immediate threats while proactively providing protection from future threats 
we also provide software to manage and enforce security policies for organizations of any size 
finally  we incorporate mcafee expert services  foundstone services and technical support to ensure a solution is actively meeting our customers needs 
these integrated solutions help our customers solve problems  enhance security and reduce costs 
we have designed a strategy that focuses on the following business objectives to extend our leadership position in corporate and consumer endpoint security  to interlock our endpoint solutions and secure the network perimeter  and to pursue new solution opportunities that build upon our multi platform strategy of personal computers  internet and mobile security 
threat protection offerings our threat protection products address security in three key areas endpoint protection data protection network protection endpoint protection 
this encompasses security solutions for corporate computer systems  including servers  desktop and laptop computers  handheld voice and data phones  and other devices that are the entry and exit points for corporate systems and networks 
data protection 
this refers to security measures for data residing on various devices that prevent data loss through unauthorized transmission or distribution and protect the data through encryption if the device on which it resides is lost or stolen 

table of contents network protection 
products in this area apply to internal corporate networks and provide the same type of security measures that endpoint protection provides for servers  laptops and other devices 
network protection also encompasses email and web protection  which encompasses spam filters  virus  spyware and worm protection for email servers and products that block malicious web sites 
each of our threat protection offerings is backed by mcafee avert labs  a leading global threat research organization

see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about our recent business combination activities 
our customers and markets we have one business and operate in one industry segment developing  marketing  distributing and supporting computer security solutions for large enterprises  governments  small and medium sized businesses and individual consumers through a network of qualified partners and other distribution models 
we conduct business in five geographic regions north america  europe  middle east and africa  collectively referred to as emea  japan  asia pacific  excluding japan  and latin america 
for financial information about foreign and domestic operations  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
business to business solutions we market our business solutions and offerings to commercial and government customers through resellers and distributors 
our two largest distributors  ingram micro inc and tech data corp  together accounted for of our net revenue in consumer solutions we market our consumer solutions and offerings to individual consumers directly through online distribution methods and indirectly through traditional distribution channels  such as retail and original equipment manufacturers oems 
our mcafee consumer business is responsible for online distribution of our products sold to individual consumers over the internet  including products distributed by our online partners  and for licensing of technology to strategic distribution partners for sale to individual consumers  with certain exceptions 
business models we derive our revenue from three sources i service and support revenue  which includes maintenance  training and consulting revenue  ii subscription revenue  which consists of revenue from customers who purchase licenses for products for the term of the subscription  and iii product revenue  which includes revenue from perpetual licenses those with a one time license fee and from hardware sales 
service and support revenue accounted for of net revenue in  subscription revenue accounted for and product revenue accounted for of net revenue 
we typically license our software products to corporate and government customers using our perpetual plus licensing arrangements  which provide a perpetual license coupled with an initial support period of one year 
we also sell perpetual licenses in connection with sales of our hardware based products in which software is bundled with the hardware platform 
most of our licenses are sold with renewable annual maintenance contracts 
for our online subscription services  customers rent or subscribe to use our security services for a defined period of time by downloading our software to their personal computers 
some products or product features are also available under a software as a service model saas  under which we offer our software applications to customers for their use over the internet 
this allows customers to purchase and use applications and modules on a subscription basis  without the need for individual client installations or additional maintenance costs 
because our 
table of contents online subscription services and our saas offerings are versionless  or self updating  customers subscribing to these services can use the most recent version of the software without having to purchase product updates or upgrades 
our online subscription consumer products and services are found at our web site www 
mcafee 
com where customers download our applications 
these enable customers to detect and eliminate viruses on personal computers pcs  repair pcs from damage caused by some viruses  and optimize hard drives 
our web site offers mcafee siteadvisor as a free download and offers mcafee siteadvisor plus  mcafee virus scan plus  mcafee internet security suites and mcafee total protection solutions for customers to purchase 
we acquired scanalert in january and plan to integrate this technology with siteadvisor 
our online subscription services are available to customers and small business through various channel relationships with internet service providers isps  such as aol and comcast  and also available through oems  such as dell 
isps offer mcafee subscription services as either a standard feature included in their service  or as a premium service 
we also make our online subscription products and services available over the internet as a managed environment 
unlike our online subscription service solutions  these managed service provider msp solutions are customized  monitored and updated by networking professionals for a specific customer 
mcafee sales and marketing sales in north america our north american sales force is organized by product offerings and customer type 
a subset of our sales representatives focus on renewing the mcafee systems security installed base  while a larger group focuses on our full offering of security risk management products and upgrades 
small business customers are served primarily through our reseller partners with a channel marketing organization assisting with lead generation  and a channel support team responsible for partner training and support 
although members of our sales team are an integral part of the sales process  almost all ordering and fulfillment for our commercial customers is handled by our distribution partners 
sales outside of north america outside of north america  we have sales and support operations in emea  japan  asia pacific  and latin america 
in   and  net revenue outside of north america accounted for  and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect that net revenue from operations outside of north america will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue over the next few years 
within our global geographies  our sales resources are organized by country  and the larger markets may further allocate their sales resources by mcafee product line and or customer segments 
as in north america  almost all ordering and fulfillment is handled by our distribution partners 
resellers and distributors substantially all of our sales come through our network of resellers  distributors and retailers 
the mcafee securityalliance global partner program is a global marketing and sales enablement program designed to meet the needs of our reseller partners in supporting end user customers 
we currently utilize corporate resellers  including asap software  inc  cdw corporation  computacenter plc  dell inc  dimension data  insight enterprises  inc  softmart  inc  software house international  softchoice corporation and others  as well as network and systems integrators who offer our solutions to corporate  small and medium business and government customers 
independent software distributors who currently supply our products include ingram micro inc  tech data corporation  avnet  inc 
and moca 
these distributors supply our products primarily to large retailers  value added resellers vars  mail order and telemarketing companies 
we also sell our retail packaged products through several of the larger computer and software retailers as well as broader based retailers  including fry s  office depot  best buy  wal mart  costco and yamada 
mcafee marketing and sales teams work closely with our major reseller and distributor accounts to manage demand generating activities  training  order flow and affiliate relationships 

table of contents our top ten distributors typically account for to of our net revenue on an annual basis 
our agreements with our distributors are not exclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
terminated distributors may not continue to sell our products 
if one of our significant distributors terminated its relationship with us  we could experience a significant disruption in the distribution of our products and a decline in our net revenue 
we use a sell through revenue recognition model for distributors  under which we recognize revenue at the time our distributors sell the products to their customers 
under this model  our distributors are permitted to purchase software licenses from us at the same time they fill customer orders and to pay for hardware and retail products only when they sell these products to their customers 
in addition  prior to selling our products to their customers  our distributors are permitted rights of return subject to varying limitations 
after a distributor sells a product to its customer  the distributor generally has no right to return the product to us  unless we approve the return from the final customer to the distributor 
strategic channel partners our channel efforts include strategic alliances with complimentary manufacturers to expand our reach and scale 
oems and isps license our products for resale to end users or inclusion with their products 
strategic channel partners include aol  at t  cable and wireless plc  comcast corporation  dell  inc  telecom italia spa  toshiba  and telefonica sa  among others 
depending on the arrangement  oems may sell our software bundled with the pc or related services  pre install our software and allow us to complete the sale  or sublicense a single version of our products to end users who must register the product with us in order to receive updates 
strategic alliances from time to time  we enter into strategic alliances with third parties to support our future growth plans 
these relationships may include joint technology development and integration  research cooperation  co marketing activities and or sell through arrangements 
for example  our security innovation alliance program is a technology partnering program that is designed to accelerate the development of interoperable security products that can be integrated in complex customer environments 
members of the alliance can develop products that will integrate with epolicy orchestrator and market them as mcafee compatible 
our customers benefit from faster and less costly deployment 
as part of our ntt docomo alliance in japan  we have jointly developed technology to provide integrated malware protection against threats to mobile handsets 
marketing activities we use channel marketing to market  promote  train and provide incentives to our resellers and distributors  and to promote our offerings to their end user customers 
we offer our resellers and distributors technical and sales training classes  online training resources  and marketing and sales demand generation assistance kits 
we also provide specific cooperative marketing programs for end user seminars  catalogs  demand creation programs  sales events  and other items 
one of the principal means of marketing our products and services is online via the internet 
our web site  www 
mcafee 
com  supports marketing activities to our key customer and prospect segments  including home and home office users  small and medium sized businesses  large enterprises and our partner community 
our web site contains various marketing materials and information about our products 
our customers can download and purchase some products directly online 
we also promote our products and services through advertising activities in trade publications  direct mail campaigns  television  billboards  and strategic arrangements  as well as online through key word and search based advertising 
in addition  we attend trade shows and industry conferences  and we publish periodic channel and customer newsletters 
we also market our products through the use of rebate programs and marketing funds 
within most countries  we typically offer volume incentive rebates to channel partners and promotional rebates to end users 
our channel partners may earn a volume incentive rebate primarily based upon their sale of our products to end users 

table of contents competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
we expect both product and pricing competitive pressures to increase in the near term as the industry continues to consolidate and our competitors grow more rapidly through acquisitions 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  stronger relationships with strategic channel partners  larger technical staffs  established relationships with hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and other advantages compared to us 
these factors may provide our competitors with an advantage 
increasingly  security protection is offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
potential customers may perceive our products as unnecessary or obsolete if similar functionality is available for free 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our sales could grow more slowly or decline 
competitive pressures could also lead to increases in competition driven expenses such as advertising expenses  product rebates and marketing funds provided to our channel partners 
see risk factors below 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our corporate products include  but are not limited to  performance  functionality and features  brand name recognition  breadth of product group  integration of products  price  the effectiveness of distributor promotion programs  and quality of customer support 
we believe that we generally compete favorably against our competitors in these areas 
however  lack of name recognition may be a concern with potential new customers 
competitor solutions may be more attractive than ours to the extent they are integrated with a larger product solution such as outsourced email 
in addition  our pricing may be less competitive  particularly compared to smaller competitors trying to enter the market 
our principal competitors in the corporate market are as follows system protection market 
our principal competitors in the anti virus market are symantec corp  trend micro  inc and microsoft corporation  each of which operates on a world wide basis 
trend micro inc remains the strongest competitor in the asian anti virus market 
kaspersky lab  inc  eset software  panda software  sophos  f secure corporation and dr 
ahn s anti virus lab are also competitors in their respective markets 
network protection market 
our principal competitors in the network protection market are cisco systems inc  ibm juniper networks  inc  symantec corp  check point software technologies ltd  sourcefire  inc and com corporation 
ibm  qualys and ncircle are the strongest competitors in the vulnerability management market 
email and web security market 
our principal competitors in the email and web security market  which includes our siteadvisor products  include microsoft corporation  trend micro  inc  symantec corporation  barracuda networks and various search engine providers  namely google  inc and yahoo  inc 
other competitors 
in addition to competition from large technology companies such as ibm  novell inc and microsoft corporation  we also face competition from smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products 
in the consumer market  we believe that the principal competitive factors include  but are not limited to  brand name recognition and reputation  convenience of purchase  price  breadth of functionality and features  ease of use  and frequency of upgrades and updates 
our principal competitors are symantec corp 
with their norton product line  microsoft corporation and trend micro inc we typically compete effectively in each of these areas 
however  if it is more convenient for consumers to use a competitive product for example  when they purchase computers that are prebundled with a competitor s product  we could be at a competitive disadvantage 
our prices are also a competitive disadvantage compared to free solutions and when competitors offer limited time promotions 
our proprietary technology our success depends to a great extent on our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights to our software 
however  the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary software technology may be inadequate to deter misuse or 
table of contents theft of this technology 
often  we do not obtain signed license agreements from customers who license products from us 
in these cases  we include an electronic version of an end user license in all of our electronically distributed software and a printed license with our products that are distributed in a box 
although this is common practice for software companies that sell off the shelf products to have licenses that are not signed by the licensee  certain legal authorities believe that such licenses may not be enforceable under the laws of many states and foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect these rights at all or offer only limited protection for these rights 
furthermore  we are aware that a significant number of users of our anti virus products have not paid any license or support fees to us 
see risk factors below 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  our business is seasonal 
software license and maintenance orders are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters and lower in our first and second quarters 
a significant decline in license and maintenance orders is typical in the first quarter of our year as compared to license and maintenance orders in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license and maintenance orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped or services are performed and other revenue recognition criteria are met 
our employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals worldwide 
less than of our employees are represented by a labor union 
competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense in the software industry 
our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
to date  we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees  but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future or be able to retain qualified personnel 
company information we were incorporated in the state of delaware in under the name of mcafee associates  inc in conjunction with our merger with network general corporation  we changed our name to networks associates  inc in  we changed our name to mcafee  inc

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
some but not all of the risks we face are described below 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we have not disclosed below may also impair our business operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and reduce the value of an investment in our common stock 
we face intense competition and we expect competitive pressures to increase in the future 
this competition could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
if our competitors gain market share in the markets for our products  our sales could grow more slowly or decline 
competitive pressures could also lead to increases in expenses such as advertising expenses  product rebates  product placement fees  and marketing funds provided to our channel partners 
advantages of larger competitors our principal competitors in each of our product categories and in geographic markets are described in business competition  above 
our competitors include some large enterprises such as microsoft  cisco systems  symantec  ibm  google and trend micro 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive international operations  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors and or greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
increasingly  our competitors are large vendors of hardware or operating system software 
these competitors are continuously incorporating system and network protection functionality into their products  and enhancing that functionality either through internal development or increasingly through acquisitions 
for example  in microsoft released its consumer security solution and continues to boost the security functionality of its windows platform through its acquisition strategy 
more details about competitors expanding their system and network protection offerings are described in business competition  above 
these large vendors have significantly greater product development and acquisition budgets and resources than we do 
this might enable them to provide greater functionality and to expand that functionality more quickly than we are able to do 
consumer business competition more than of our revenue comes from our consumer business 
our growth of this business relies on direct sales and sales through relationships with isps such as aol and comcast  and pc oems  such as dell and toshiba 
as competition in this market increases  we have and will continue to experience pricing pressures that could have a negative effect on our ability to sustain our revenue and market share growth 
as our consumer business becomes increasingly more dependent upon the partner model  our retail businesses may continue to decline 
further  as penetration of the consumer anti virus market through the isp model increases  we expect that pricing and competitive pressures in this market will become even more acute 
low priced or free competitive products security protection is increasingly being offered by third parties at significant discounts to our prices or  in some cases is bundled for free 
for example  microsoft over time has sought to add security features to its operating systems that would provide functionality similar to what our products offer  while at the same time making it more difficult for us to integrate our products with its operating systems 
the widespread inclusion of lower priced or free products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products or render our products obsolete and unmarketable even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products 
the expansion of these competitive trends could have a significant negative impact on our sales and financial results 
we also face competition from numerous smaller companies  shareware and freeware authors and open source projects that may develop competing products  as well as from future competitors  currently unknown to us  who 
table of contents may enter the markets because the barriers to entry are fairly low 
smaller and or newer companies often compete aggressively on price 
we face product development risks due to rapid changes in our industry 
failure to keep pace with these changes could harm our business and financial results 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological developments  continually evolving industry trends and standards and ongoing changes in customer requirements 
our success depends on our ability to timely and effectively keep pace with these developments 
keeping pace with industry changes we must enhance and expand our product offerings to reflect industry trends  new technologies and new operating environments as they become increasingly important to customer deployments 
for example  we must expand our offerings for virtual computer environments  we must continue to expand our security technologies for mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants  we must develop products that are compatible with new or otherwise emerging operating systems  while remaining compatible with popular operating systems such as linux  sun s solaris  unix  macintosh osx and leopard  and windows xp  nt and vista  and we must continue to expand our business models beyond traditional software licensing and subscription models 
specifically  software as a service saas is becoming an increasingly important method and business model for the delivery of applications 
because of the advantages that saas models offer to customers over traditional software sales and licensing  competitors using saas models to a greater extent than we do could enjoy growth in their businesses and  as a result  we could lose business to such competitors 
we must also continuously work to ensure that our products meet changing industry certifications and standards 
failure to keep pace with any changes that are important to our customers could cause us to lose customers and could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
impact of product development delays or competitive announcements our ability to adapt to changes can be hampered by product development delays 
we may experience delays in product development as we have at times in the past 
complex products like ours may contain undetected errors or version compatibility problems  particularly when first released  which could delay or adversely impact market acceptance 
in addition  we may choose not to deliver a previously announced  partially developed product  thereby increasing our development costs without a corresponding benefit 
for example  if microsoft incorporates a product that performs the same or similar function as one of our products under development into the windows platform  we might discontinue development if we believe the microsoft product will undermine the market for our product 
this could happen even if microsoft s product is inferior or more limited than our product  if the microsoft product is lower priced or made available at no additional cost to customers 
the occurrence of these events could negatively impact our business 
if our products do not work properly  we could experience negative publicity  damage to our reputation  legal liability  declining sales and increased expenses 
failure to protect against security breaches our products are used to protect and manage computer systems and networks that may be critically important to our customers 
customers rely on our products to protect against security risks  prevent the loss of sensitive data and manage compliance activities 
because of the complexity of our products  they could contain undetected errors when first introduced and when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have from time to time found errors in versions of our products  and we may find such errors in the future 
furthermore  because of the complexity of the environments in which our products operate  our products may have errors or defects that customers identify after deployment 
failures  errors or defects in our products could result in security breaches or compliance violations for our customers  disruption or damage to their networks or other negative consequences 
any such product problems 
table of contents could have a negative impact on us as well 
for example  failure of our products to identify or block viruses could result in negative publicity  damage to our reputation  declining sales  increased expenses and customer relation issues 
such failures could also result in product liability damage claims against us by our customers  even though our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
furthermore  the correction of defects could divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
a major security breach at one of our customers that is attributable to or not preventable by our products could be very damaging to our business 
any actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  could adversely affect the market s perception of our security products 
false alarms our system protection software products have in the past  and these products and our intrusion protection products may at times in the future  falsely detect viruses or computer threats that do not actually exist 
these false alarms  while typical in the security industry  may impair the perceived reliability of our products and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our products 
in addition  we have in the past been subject to litigation claiming damages related to a false alarm  and similar claims may be made in the future 
our email and web solutions anti spam  anti spyware and safe search products may falsely identify emails  programs or web sites as unwanted spam  potentially unwanted programs or unsafe 
they may also fail to properly identify unwanted emails  programs or unsafe web sites  particularly because spam emails  spyware or malware are often designed to circumvent anti spam or spyware products and to incorrectly identify legitimate web sites as unsafe 
parties whose emails or programs are incorrectly blocked by our products  or whose web sites are incorrectly identified as unsafe or as utilizing phishing techniques  may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or unsafe and or for interfering with their businesses 
in addition  false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may discourage potential customers from using or continuing to use these products 
customer misuse of products our products may also not work properly if they are misused or abused by customers or non customer third parties who obtain access and use of our products 
these situations may arise where an organization uses our products in a manner that impacts their end users or employees privacy or where our products are misappropriated to censor private access to the internet 
any of these situations could impact the perceived reliability of our products  result in negative press coverage  negatively affect our reputation and adversely impact our financial results 
our international operations involve risks that could divert the time and attention of management  increase our expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial results 
our international operations increase our risks in several aspects of our business  including but not limited to risks relating to revenue  legal and tax compliance  and the overall political climate and potential political instability 
net revenue in our operating regions outside of north america represented of total net revenue in  increasing from in and in the risks associated with our continued focus on international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results 
revenue risks revenue risks include  among others  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonality  currency fluctuations  and the high incidence of software piracy and fraud in some countries 
the primary product development risk to our revenue is our ability to deliver new products in a timely manner and to successfully localize our products for a significant number of international markets in different languages 

table of contents legal and compliance risks we face a variety of legal and compliance risks 
one primary legal risk is that some of our computer security solutions  particularly those incorporating encryption technology  may be subject to export restrictions 
as a result  some products cannot be exported to international customers without prior united states us government approval 
the list of products and end users for which export approval is required  and the related regulatory policies  are subject to revision by the us government at any time 
the cost of compliance with us and international export laws and changes in existing laws could affect our ability to sell certain products in certain markets and could have a material adverse effect on our international revenue and expense 
if we  or our resellers  fail to comply with applicable law and regulations  we may become subject to penalties and fines or restrictions that may adversely affect our business 
another significant legal risk resulting from our international operations is compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it may be common for non mcafee personnel to engage in business practices that are prohibited by the fcpa or other us laws and regulations 
for example  in some countries it is customary to make payments to government regulators in order to encourage prompt and desirable regulatory actions 
such payments by us companies  employees or agents of us companies are prohibited by the fcpa 
although we have implemented training along with policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with this and similar laws  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  will not take actions in violation of our policies 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies and training programs  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other legal risks include international labor laws and our relationship with our employees and regional work councils  compliance with more stringent consumer protection and privacy laws  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
our principal tax risks are potentially adverse tax consequences due to foreign value added taxes  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and changes in tax laws 
currency exchange and interest rate risks a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability  such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation  could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products  or could make our products more expensive or could increase our costs of doing business in certain countries during  we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of million in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  compared to net foreign currency transaction losses of million in and million in although foreign exchange rates have not had a substantial impact on our results during through  we may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
see liquidity and capital resources currency fluctuation risks  below and note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for additional information regarding currency exchange rate risks 
general operating risks more general risks of international business operations include the increased costs of establishing  managing and coordinating the activities of geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations particularly sales and support  and shared service centers located on multiple continents in a wide range of time zones 
we face a number of risks related to our product sales through distributors and other third parties 
significant percentage of sales through distributors we sell a significant amount of our products through third party intermediaries such as distributors  value added resellers  pc oems  isps and other distribution channel partners referred to collectively as distributors 

table of contents reliance on third parties for distribution exposes us to a variety of risks  some of which described below  that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
limited control over timing of product delivery we have limited control over the timing of the delivery of our products to customers by third party distributors 
we generally do not require our resellers and oem partners to meet minimum sales volumes  so their sales may vary significantly from period to period 
in particular  the volume of our products shipped by our oem partners depends on the volume of computers shipped by the pc oems  which is outside of our control 
these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast our revenue accurately and they also can cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably 
competitive aspects of distributor relationships our distributors may sell other vendors products that compete with our products 
although we offer our distributors incentives to focus on sales of our products  they may give greater priority to products of our competitors  for a variety of reasons 
in order to maximize sales of our products rather than those of our competitors  we must effectively support these partners with  among other things  appropriate financial incentives to encourage them to invest in sales tools  such as online sales and technical training and product collateral needed to support their customers and prospects 
if we do not properly support our partners  they may focus more on our competitors products  and their sales of our products would decline 
our pc oems partners are also in a position to exert competitive pricing pressure 
competition for oems business continues to increase  and it gives the oems leverage to demand lower product prices from us in order to secure their business 
even if we negotiate what we believe are favorable pricing terms when we first establish a relationship with an oem  at the time of the renewal of the agreement  we may be required to renegotiate our agreement with them on less favorable terms 
lower net prices for our products would adversely impact our operating margins 
loss of distributors we invest significant time  money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our distributors  but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time 
the agreements we have with our distributors  including those with ingram micro inc and tech data corporation  our two largest distributors  can generally be terminated by either party without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
if any significant distributor terminates its agreement with us  we could experience a significant interruption in the distribution of our products and our revenues could decline 
we could also lose the benefit of our investment of time  money and resources in the distributor relationship 
a significant portion of our net revenue is attributable to a fairly small number of distributors 
our top ten distributors represented our net revenue in  in and in reliance on a relatively small number of third parties for a significant portion of our distribution exposes us to significant risks to net revenue and net income if our relationship with one or more of our key distributors is terminated for any reason 
although a distributor can terminate its relationship with us for any reason  one factor that may lead to termination is a divergence of our business interests and those of our distributors and potential conflicts of interest 
for example  our acquisition activity has resulted in the termination of distributor relationships that no longer fit with the distributors business priorities 
future acquisition activity could cause similar termination of  or disruption in  our distributor relationships  which could adversely impact our revenues 
credit risk some of our distributors may experience financial difficulties  which could adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million as of december  we regularly review the collectability and credit worthiness of our distributors to determine an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts 
our uncollectible accounts could exceed our current or future allowances  which could adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
we may buy or make investments in complementary companies  products and technologies 
from through the date of this filing  we have completed eight acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of these acquisitions 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in significant acquisition related charges and dilution to our stockholders in addition to the risks noted below 
we face a number of risks relating to our acquisitions  including the following  any of which could harm our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our past or future acquisitions 
integration integration of an acquired company or technology is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the successful integration of an acquisition requires  among other things  that we integrate and retain key management  sales  research and development and other personnel  integrate the acquired products into our product offerings from both an engineering and sales and marketing perspective  integrate and support preexisting supplier  distribution and customer relationships  coordinate research and development efforts  and consolidate duplicate facilities and functions and integrate back office accounting  order processing and support functions 
the geographic distance between the companies  the complexity of the technologies and operations being integrated and the disparate corporate cultures being combined may increase the difficulties of integrating an acquired company or technology 
management s focus on the integration of operations may distract attention from our day to day business and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
in addition  it is common in the technology industry for aggressive competitors to attract customers and recruit key employees away from companies during the integration phase of an acquisition 
if integration of our acquired businesses or assets is not successful  we may experience adverse financial or competitive effects 
internal controls  policies and procedures acquired companies or businesses are likely to have different standards  controls  contracts  procedures and policies  making it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information and other systems 
this risk is amplified by the increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
acquisitions of privately held and or non us companies are particularly challenging because their prior practices in these areas typically do not meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
use of cash and securities our available cash and securities may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products 
from through  we used more than million in cash as payment for technology companies and assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more details on these acquisitions 
moreover  when we acquire a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that may not be fully known at the time of acquisition 
to the extent we continue to make acquisitions  we will require additional cash and or shares of our common stock as payment 
the use of securities would cause dilution for our existing stockholders 
key employees from acquired companies may be difficult to retain and assimilate the success of many acquisitions depends to a great extent on our ability to retain key employees from the acquired company 
this can be challenging  particularly in the highly competitive market for technical personnel 
retaining key executives for the long term can also be difficult due to other opportunities available to them 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace any key management members or other critical personnel that do not accept employment with mcafee following the acquisition 
in addition to retaining key employees  we must integrate them into our company  which can be difficult and costly 
changes in management or other critical 
table of contents personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of some unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
accounting charges acquisitions may result in substantial accounting charges for restructuring and other expenses  write offs of in process research and development  future impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation expense  any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
critical personnel may be difficult to attract  assimilate and retain 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain senior management personnel  as well as technically qualified and highly skilled sales  consulting  technical  finance and marketing personnel 
other than members of executive management who have at will employment agreements  our employees are not typically subject to an employment agreement or non competition agreement 
in the recent past we have experienced significant turnover in our senior management team and in our worldwide sales and finance organizations and replacing this personnel remains difficult 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace any key management member or other critical personnel 
integrating new management and other key personnel also may be difficult and costly 
changes in management or other critical personnel may be disruptive to our business and might also result in our loss of unique skills and the departure of existing employees and or customers 
it may take significant time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel 
other personnel related issues that we may encounter include competition for personnel  need for competitive pay packages competition for qualified individuals in our industry is intense 
to attract and retain critical personnel  we believe that we must maintain an open and collaborative work environment 
we also believe we need to provide a competitive compensation package  including stock options  other stock awards and other incentives 
increases in shares available for issuance under our stock option plans require stockholder approval 
institutional stockholders  or our other stockholders  may not approve future requests for increases in shares available under our equity incentive plans 
for example  at our annual meeting held in december  our stockholders did not approve a proposed increase in shares available for grant under our employee stock option plans 
we continue to evaluate our compensation programs and in particular our equity compensation philosophy 
in the future  we may decide to issue fewer stock options  possibly impairing our ability to attract and retain necessary personnel 
conversely  issuing a comparable number of stock options could adversely impact our results of operations due to the accounting charges required in connection with equity compensation 
risks relating to new hires and senior management changes we continue to hire in key areas and have added a number of new employees in connection with our acquisitions 
we have also increased our hiring in bangalore  india in connection with the relocation of a significant portion of our research and development operations to india 
during and  we experienced significant changes in our senior management team  as a number of officers resigned or were terminated and several key management positions were vacant for a significant period of time 
in april  david dewalt was hired as our chief executive officer and president 
later in we also appointed other senior executives 
we may continue to experience changes in senior management going forward 
for new employees  including senior management  there may be reduced levels of productivity as recent additions or hires are trained or otherwise assimilate and adapt to our organization and culture 
the significant turnover in our senior management team during and may make it difficult to attract new employees and retain existing employees 
further  this turnover may also make it difficult to execute on our business plan and achieve our planned financial results 

table of contents our financial results can fluctuate significantly  making it difficult for us to accurately estimate operating results 
impact of fluctuations over the past five years our revenues  gross margins and operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and we expect fluctuations in our operating results to continue in the future 
thus  our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
the fluctuations make it difficult for us to accurately estimate operating results 
furthermore  because our expenses are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenues  expenses in the short term are relatively fixed 
this makes it difficult for us to adjust our expenses in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall in a given period 
volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
factors that may cause our revenues  gross margins and other operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  include  but are not limited to the following timing of product orders a significant portion of our revenue in any quarter comes from previously deferred revenue  which is a somewhat predictable component of our quarterly revenue 
however  a meaningful part of revenue depends on contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in the current quarter 
typically we generate the most orders in the last month of our quarters 
some customers believe they can enhance their bargaining power by waiting until the end of our quarter to place their order 
any failure or delay in closing significant new orders in a given quarter could have a material adverse impact on our results for that quarter 
also  personnel limitations and system processing constraints could adversely impact our ability to process the large number of orders that typically occur near the end of a fiscal quarter 
reliability and timeliness of expense data we increasingly rely upon third party manufacturers to manufacture our hardware based products  our reliance on their ability to provide us with timely and accurate product cost information exposes us to risk 
a failure of our third party manufacturers to provide us with timely and accurate product cost information may impact our costs of goods sold and negatively impact our ability to accurately and timely report our operating results 
issues relating to third party distribution  manufacturing and fulfillment relationships we rely heavily on third parties to distribute our products 
any changes in the performance of the relationships with our distribution partners can impact our operating results 
we also rely on third parties to manufacture our products 
changes in our supply chain could result in product fulfillment delays that contribute to fluctuations in operating results from period to period 
we typically fulfill delivery of our hardware based products from centralized distribution centers 
we have in the past and may in the future make changes in our product delivery network 
changes in our product delivery network may disrupt our ability to timely and efficiently meet our product delivery commitments  particularly at the end of a quarter 
as a result  we may experience increased costs in the short term as temporary delivery solutions are implemented to address unanticipated delays in product delivery 
in addition  product delivery delays may negatively impact our ability to recognize revenue if shipments are delayed at the end of a quarter 
product mix another source of fluctuations in our operating results and  in particular  gross profit margins  is the mix of products we sell and services we offer  including the mix between corporate versus consumer products  hardware based compared to software based products  perpetual licenses versus subscription licenses  and maintenance and 
table of contents support services compared to consulting services or product revenue 
product mix can impact operating expenses as well as the amount of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition  so our profitability can fluctuate significantly based on product mix 
timing of new products and customers the timing of the introduction and adoption of new products  product upgrades or updates by us or our competitors can have a significant impact on revenue from period to period 
for example  revenues tend to be higher shortly after we introduce new products compared to periods without new products 
our revenues may decline after new product introductions by competitors 
in addition  the volume  size  and terms of new customer licenses can cause fluctuations in our revenue 
additional cash and non cash sources of fluctuations a number of other factors that are peripheral to our core  ongoing business operations and our cash flow also contribute to variability in our operating results 
these include  but are not limited to  expenses related to our acquisition and disposition activities  stock based compensation expense  unanticipated costs associated with litigation or investigations  costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  costs and charges related to certain extraordinary events such as restructurings and financial restatements  substantial declines in estimated values of long lived assets below the value at which they are reflected in our financial statements  and changes in generally accepted accounting principles 
conditions and changes in the national and global economic and political environments may adversely affect our business and financial results 
adverse economic conditions in markets in which we operate can harm our business 
if economic growth in the united states and other countries economies is slowed  many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  servers  and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have a more direct impact on our business 
any of these events would likely harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
recent turmoil in the political environment in many parts of the world  including terrorist activities and military actions  the continuing tension in and surrounding iraq  and increases in energy costs due to instability in oil producing regions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
if global economic and market conditions  or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets deteriorate  we may experience material impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control and financial reporting environment  which impacts the accuracy  completeness and timeliness of our external financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control and financial reporting environment 
in our form k for the year ended december   our management identified a material weakness relating to our accounting for income taxes 
we have implemented  and will continue to implement  additional controls and procedures to address the material weakness related to accounting for income taxes 
see item a  controls and procedures  for details of these material weakness remediation programs 
these efforts have resulted  and could further result  in significant expenses and could divert management attention away from operating our business 
even though our management believes that our efforts to remediate internal control deficiencies have improved the operation of our internal control over financial reporting  we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken or we are planning to take will sufficiently and satisfactorily remediate the identified 
table of contents material weaknesses 
ongoing material weaknesses in internal controls create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our interim and annual financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
if management identifies additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future  their correction could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time consuming 
in addition  the discovery of further material weaknesses could also require us to restate our prior period operating results 
if a material weakness is identified for a future period year end or if our previously identified material weaknesses are not remediated  our independent auditors would be unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
this in turn could damage investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could affect our stock price and potentially subject us to litigation 
we face numerous risks relating to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights and our use of third party intellectual property  many of which could result in the loss of our intellectual property rights as well as other material adverse impacts on our business and financial results and condition 
limited protection of our intellectual property rights against potential infringers we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and copyrights to establish and protect proprietary rights in our software 
however  the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary software may not deter its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our proprietary technology into their products 
we are aware that a number of users of our security products have not paid license  technical support  or subscription fees to us 
certain jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal infrastructure for effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
changing legal interpretations of liability for unauthorized use of our software or lessened sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to refraining from intellectual property piracy or other infringements of intellectual property could also harm our business 
frequency  expense and risks of intellectual property litigation in the network and system security market litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect our trade secrets  patents and other intellectual property rights 
similarly  we may be required to defend against claimed infringement by others 
for example  as discussed in item  legal proceedings  we are currently defending a patent infringement case that seeks to prevent us from selling certain of our products 
the litigation process is subject to inherent uncertainties  so we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position 
in addition to the expense and distraction associated with litigation  adverse determinations could cause us to lose our proprietary rights  prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  require us to obtain licenses of patents or other intellectual property rights that may be held invalid or infringed upon by our products licenses may not be available on reasonable commercial terms or at all  and subject us to significant liabilities  including monetary liabilities 
if we acquire technology to include in our products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties verify the origin and ownership of any software we acquire 
similarly  we face exposure to infringement actions if we hire software engineers who were previously employed by competitors and those employees inadvertently or deliberately incorporate proprietary technology of our competitors into our products despite efforts by our competitors and us to prevent such infringement 
potential risks of using of open source software like many other software companies  we use and distribute open source software in order to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively 
we face certain risks relating to our use of open source code 
open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated or uncertain obligations regarding our products 
for example  the scope and requirements of the most common open source software license  the gnu general public license gpl have not been interpreted in a court of law 
our use of gpl or other open 
table of contents source software could subject certain portions of our proprietary software to the gpl requirements or other similar requirements 
that may have an adverse impact on our sale of the products incorporating the open source software 
other forms of open source software licensing present license compliance risks for us 
if we fail to comply with the license obligations  we could be sued and or lose the right to use the open source code 
our use of open source code could also result in us developing and selling products that infringe third party intellectual property rights 
it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the code incorporates proprietary software 
we have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source 
however  we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
we also have processes and controls in place to review the use of open source in the products developed by companies that we acquire 
despite having conducted appropriate due diligence prior to completing the acquisition  products or technologies that we acquire may nonetheless include open source software that was not identified during the initial due diligence 
our ability to commercialize products or technologies of acquired companies that incorporate open source software or to otherwise fully realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may be restricted for the reasons described in the preceding two paragraphs 
our strategic alliances and our relationships with manufacturing partners exposes us to a range of business risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
strategic alliances uncertainty of realizing anticipated benefits 
we have entered into strategic alliances with numerous third parties to support our future growth plans 
these relationships may include technology licensing  joint technology development and integration  research cooperation  co marketing activities and or sell through arrangements 
we face a number of risks relating to our strategic alliances  including those described below 
these risks may prevent us from realizing the desired benefits from our strategic alliances on a timely basis or at all  which could have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
challenges relating to integrated products 
strategic alliances require significant coordination between the parties involved  particularly if an alliance requires that we integrate the other company s products with our products 
this could involve significant time and expenditure by our technical staff and the technical staff of our strategic partner 
the integration of products from different companies may be more difficult than we anticipate  and the risk of integration difficulties  incompatible products and undetected programming errors or defects may be higher than that normally associated with new products 
the marketing and sale of products that result from strategic alliances might also be more difficult than that normally associated with new products 
sales and marketing personnel may require special training  as the new products may be more complex than our other products 
we invest significant time  money and resources to establish and maintain relationships with our strategic partners  but we have no assurance that any particular relationship will continue for any specific period of time 
our agreements relating to our strategic alliances are terminable without cause with no or minimal notice or penalties 
if we lose a significant strategic partner  we could lose the benefit of our investment of time  money and resources in the relationship 
in addition  we could be required to incur significant expenses to develop a new strategic alliance or to determine and implement an alternative plan to pursue the opportunity that we targeted with the former partner 
third party manufacturing relationships less control of the manufacturing process and outcome 
we rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture some of our hardware based network protection and system protection products 
we expect the number of our hardware based products and our reliance on third party manufacturers to increase as we continue to expand these types of solutions 
we also rely on third parties to replicate and package our boxed software products 
this reliance on third parties involves a number of risks that could have a negative impact on our business and 
table of contents financial results 
these risks include  but are not limited to  lack of control over the quality and timing of the manufacturing process  limited control over the cost of manufacturing  and the potential absence or unavailability of adequate manufacturing capacity 
inadequate capacity 
if any of our third party manufacturers fails for any reason to manufacture products of acceptable quality  in required volumes  and in a cost effective and timely manner  it could be costly as well as disruptive to product shipments 
we might be required to seek additional manufacturing capacity  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
even if additional capacity was available  the process of qualifying a new vendor could be lengthy and could cause significant delays in product shipments and could strain partner and customer relationships 
in addition  supply disruptions or cost increases could increase our costs of goods sold and negatively impact our financial performance 
our risk is relatively greater in situations where our hardware products contain critical components supplied by a single or a limited number of third parties 
any significant shortage of components could lead to cancellations of customer orders or delays in placement of orders  which would adversely impact revenue 
hardware obsolescence 
hardware based products may face greater obsolescence risks than software products 
we could incur losses or other charges in disposing of obsolete hardware inventory 
in addition  to the extent that our third party manufacturers upgrade or otherwise alter their manufacturing processes  our hardware based products could face supply constraints or risks associated with the transition of hardware based products to new platforms 
this could increase the risk of losses or other charges associated with obsolete inventory 
our tax strategy may expose us to risk 
we are generally required to account for taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process may require us to make assumptions  interpretations and judgments with respect to the meaning and application of promulgated tax laws and related administrative and judicial interpretations thereof of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the positions that we take and our interpretations of the tax laws may differ from the positions and interpretations of the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are presently under audit in many jurisdictions  including notably the united states  california and the netherlands 
the internal revenue service is presently conducting a limited scope examination of our united states federal income tax returns for the calendar years   and the state of california is auditing our income tax returns for the years and we are also in pre filing discussions with the dutch tax authorities with respect to tax years and an adverse outcome in one or more of these ongoing audits  or in any future audits that may occur  could have a significant negative impact on our cash position and net income 
although we have established reserves for these audit contingencies  there can be no assurance that the reserves will be sufficient to cover our ultimate liabilities 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and can be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including but not limited to changes in tax laws  regulations and accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions  or interpretations of those changes 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in fin in addition  fin applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or goodwill 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and negatively impact our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  service disruptions  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these 
table of contents contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
we face risks related to customer outsourcing to system integrators 
some of our customers have outsourced the management of their information technology departments to large system integrators 
if this trend continues  our established customer relationships could be disrupted and our products could be displaced by alternative system and network protection solutions offered by system integrators that do not bundle our solutions 
significant product displacements could negatively impact our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to effectively upgrade or modify our information technology system  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as part of our efforts to continue improving our internal control over financial reporting  we upgraded our existing sap information technology system during and in order to automate certain controls that were previously performed manually 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to new or upgraded systems and in applying maintenance patches to existing systems  including loss of data and decreases in productivity as personnel become familiar with new  upgraded or modified systems 
our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and as our business needs change  which could prolong the difficulties we experience with systems transitions  and we may not always employ the most effective systems for our purposes 
if we experience difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or experience significant system failures  or if we are unable to successfully modify our management information systems and respond to changes in our business needs  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
we may also experience similar results if we have difficulty applying routine maintenance patches to existing systems in a timely manner 
computer hackers may damage our products  services and systems 
due to our high profile in the network and system protection market  we have been a target of computer hackers who have  among other things  created viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack our products and services  including our various web sites 
for example  we have seen the spread of viruses  or worms  that intentionally delete anti virus and firewall software 
similarly  hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our internal systems and services 
also  a number of web sites have been subject to denial of service attacks  where a web site is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the web site to overload  resulting in a delay or disruption of service 
if successful  any of these events could damage users or our own computer systems 
in addition  since we do not control disk duplication by distributors or our independent agents  media containing our software may be infected with viruses 
business interruptions may impede our operations and the operations of our customers 
we are continually updating or modifying our accounting and other internal and external facing business systems 
modifications of these types of systems are often disruptive to business and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to properly manage this process could materially harm our business operations 
in addition  we and our customers face a number of potential business interruption risks that are beyond our respective control 
natural disasters or other events could interrupt our business or the business of our customers  and each of us is reliant on external infrastructure that may be antiquated 
our corporate headquarters in california is located near a major earthquake fault 
the potential impact of a major earthquake on our facilities  infrastructure and overall operations is not known  but could be quite severe 
despite safety precautions that have been implemented  an earthquake could seriously disrupt our entire business process 
we are largely uninsured for losses and business disruptions caused by an earthquake and other natural disasters 

table of contents we face the risk of a decrease in our cash balances and losses in our investment portfolio 
investment income is an important component of our net income 
the ability to achieve our investment objectives is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we rely on third party money managers to manage the majority of our investment portfolio in a risk controlled framework 
our cash throughout the world is invested in high quality fixed income securities and is affected by changes in interest rates 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
the outlook for our investment income is dependent on the future direction of interest rates  the amount of any share repurchases or acquisitions that we effect and the amount of cash flows from operations that are available for investment 
any significant decline in our investment income or the value of our investments as a result of falling interest rates  deterioration in the credit of the securities in which we have invested  or general market conditions  could have an adverse effect on our net income 
our investment strategy attempts to manage interest rate risk and limit credit risk 
by policy  we only invest in what we view as very high quality debt securities and our largest holdings are short term us government securities and high quality  well collateralized asset backed securities 
we do not hold any sub prime mortgages  auction rate securities or structured investment vehicles 
we do not invest in below investment grade securities 
most amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would be subject to us federal income tax  less applicable foreign tax credits 
our historical stock option granting practices have resulted in  and could continue to result in  continued or new litigation  regulatory proceedings  government enforcement actions and remedial actions  all of which have had  and will continue to have  a negative impact on our business and financial results 
in may  we announced that we had commenced an investigation of our historical stock option granting practices 
as a result of that investigation  we concluded that certain stock options had been accounted for using incorrect measurement dates  which  in some instances  were chosen with the benefit of hindsight so as to intentionally give more favorable exercise prices 
consequently  certain of our historical financial statements needed to be restated to correct improper accounting for improperly priced stock options 
in december  we filed our form k for  which included the effects of a restatement of our audited consolidated financial statements for and  our selected financial data for through  and our unaudited quarterly financial data for all quarters in and the first quarter of shortly after we announced an internal investigation of our historical stock option granting practices  both the securities and exchange commission sec and the united states department of justice doj commenced investigations of our stock option practices 
the filing of our restated consolidated financial statements did not resolve the pending sec or doj inquiries 
we are engaged in ongoing discussions with  and continue to provide information to  the sec regarding certain of our prior period consolidated financial statements 
the resolution of the sec inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices could require us to file additional restatements of our prior consolidated financial statements or require that we take other actions not presently contemplated 
as part of the remedial actions we have taken in connection with the investigation and restatement  we terminated the employment of certain employees  including former executive officers 
we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings in connection with such terminations  as well as other stockholder lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices 
we expect that there may be additional legal proceedings in the future which will require additional management time and additional expense 
any resolution of the legal proceedings may require us to make severance  settlement or other related payments in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the report for more details about ongoing legal proceedings 
we cannot predict the outcome of the pending government inquiries or stockholder or other lawsuits  and we may face additional government inquiries  stockholder lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
we cannot predict what  if any  enforcement action the sec or doj will take with respect to our failure to be current in our periodic reports or our historical stock option granting practices 

table of contents as a result of our investigation and our conclusion that certain options had been mispriced  some of our employees and former employees were potentially exposed to significantly increased income tax liabilities and penalties and or were unable to realize the benefits of their stock options 
we have taken a number of steps to remedy this situation for employees  which has contributed to increased operating expenses 
we believe we have taken  or are in the process of taking all corrective actions to compensate for the economic effects of mispriced stock options for many of our current and former employees and directors  but it is possible that there will be other actions required 
all of the events described above have required us to devote significant management time and to incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses 
these consequences have diverted management attention from business operations and have affected our financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that these impacts will continue to varying degrees in future periods 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  from time to time  we have been  and may be in the future  subject to other litigation including stockholder derivative actions or actions brought by current or former employees 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that an adverse liability resulting from such litigation is probable  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the related cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management s attention 
in this regard  we and a number of our current and former officers and directors are involved in or the subject of various legal actions 
managing  defending and indemnity obligations related to these actions have caused significant diversion of management s and the board of director s time and resulted in material expense to us 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information with respect to currently pending legal matters 
we face risks related to our settlement agreement with the securities and exchange commission 
on february   the united states district court for the northern district of california entered a final judgment permanently enjoining us and our officers and agents from future violations of the securities laws 
this final judgment resolved the charges filed against us in connection with the sec s investigation of our accounting practices that commenced in march as a result of the judgment  we will forfeit for three years the ability to invoke the safe harbor for forward looking statements provision of the private securities litigation reform act reform act 
this safe harbor provided us enhanced protection from liability related to forward looking statements if the forward looking statements were either accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements or were made without actual knowledge that they were false or misleading 
while we may still rely on the bespeaks caution doctrine that existed prior to the reform act for defenses against securities lawsuits  without the statutory safe harbor  it may be more difficult for us to defend against any such claims 
in addition  due to the permanent restraint and injunction against violating applicable securities laws  any future violation of the securities laws would be a violation of a federal court order and potentially subject us to a contempt order 
for instance  if  at some point in the future  we were to discover a fact that caused us to restate our financial statements similar to the restatements that were the subject of the sec action  we could be found to have violated the final judgment 
we cannot predict whether the sec might assert that our failure to remain current in our periodic reporting obligations or our historical stock option practices violated the final judgment or what  if any  enforcement action the sec might take upon such a determination 
further  any collateral criminal or civil investigation  proceeding or litigation related to any future violation of the judgment  such as the compliance actions mandated by the judgment  could result in the distraction of management from our day to day business and may materially and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and is likely to remain volatile 
during and up to the date of this filing  our stock price was highly volatile ranging from a per share high of to a low of 
on february   our stock s closing price per share price was 

table of contents announcements  business developments  such as a material acquisitions or dispositions  litigation developments and our ability to meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results  may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
in addition  third party announcements such as those made by our partners and competitors may contribute to current and future stock price volatility 
for example  future announcements by microsoft corporation related to its consumer and corporate security solutions may contribute to future volatility in our stock price 
certain types of investors may choose not to invest in stocks with this level of stock price volatility 
in addition to the volatility that is related to our business activities and those of others in our industry  our stock price may also experience volatility that is completely unrelated to our performance or that of the security industry 
during through january  the major us and international stock markets have been extremely volatile 
fluctuations in these broad market indices can impact mcafee s stock price regardless of mcafee s performance 
our charter documents and delaware law and our rights plan may impede or discourage a takeover  which could lower our stock price 
our charter documents and delaware law under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and could have the effect of discouraging a change of control of the company or changes in management 
our classified board and other provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  could also delay or make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us or changes in our board of directors and management more difficult 
for example  any stockholder wishing to make a stockholder proposal including director nominations at our annual meeting  must meet the qualifications and follow the procedures specified under both the securities exchange act of and our bylaws 
our rights plan our board of directors has adopted a stockholders rights plan 
the rights would become exercisable on the tenth day after a person or group announces the acquisition of or more of our common stock or announces the commencement of a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in ownership by the person or group of or more of our common stock 
if the rights become exercisable  the holders of the rights other than the person acquiring or more of our common stock will be entitled to acquire in exchange for the rights exercise price  shares of our common stock or shares of any company in which we are merged with a value equal to twice the rights exercise price 
the rights plan makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and discourages a change of control of the company not approved by our board of directors

item legal proceedings settled cases in february  we reached a confidential settlement of a breach of contract  fraud and bad faith lawsuit filed in june in the united states district court  district of massachusetts 
as part of the settlement  we acquired and recorded ownership of intangible assets valued at million with all remaining claims settled for million  of which million was recognized as expense in the three months ended june  with the balance of million being expensed in and prior periods 
the case was dismissed in march on march   the sec notified us that it had commenced a formal order of private investigation into our accounting practices 
on september   we announced we had reserved million in connection with the proposed settlement with the sec and we had deposited million in an escrow account with the sec as the designated beneficiary 
on february   the sec entered the final judgment for the settlement with us 
we also agreed to release million to the sec for the civil penalty on february  and certain other conditions  such as engaging independent consultants to examine and recommend improvements to our internal controls to ensure compliance with federal securities laws 
open cases we have described below our material legal proceedings and investigations that are currently pending and are not in the ordinary course of business 
if management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated  we record the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range  and no point within the range is more probable than another 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
while we cannot predict the likelihood of future claims or inquiries  we expect that new matters may be initiated against us from time to time 
the results of claims  lawsuits and investigations also cannot be predicted  and it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters  individually and in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
government inquiries relating to historical stock option practices in may  we announced that we had commenced an investigation of our historical stock option granting practices 
as a result of that investigation  we concluded that certain stock options had been accounted for using incorrect measurement dates  which  in some instances  were chosen with the benefit of hindsight so as to intentionally give more favorable exercise prices 
consequently  certain of our historical financial statements needed to be restated to correct improper accounting for backdated stock options

com  previously one of our consolidated subsidiaries that was a publicly traded company from december through september 
table of contents on november   the investigative team created by the special committee of our board of directors met with the enforcement staff of the sec in washington dc and presented the initial findings of the investigation 
pursuant to discussions between the investigative team and the sec during that meeting  the scope of the investigation was expanded to include a review of the historical mcafee 
com option grants along with our historical exercise activity with a view toward determining potential exercise date manipulation and post employment arrangements with former executives 
we have provided documents requested  and we are cooperating with the sec and doj

this is one of a number of cases challenging underwriting practices in the initial public offerings ipos  of more than companies

we receive up front payments for maintenance and subscriptions but we recognize revenue over the service or subscription term 
approximately of our total net revenue during came from prior period deferred revenue 
as with revenue  we believe that deferred revenue is a key indicator of the growth and health of our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  income from operations and net income  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
to apply critical accounting policies we must evaluate a number of 
table of contents complex criteria and significant accounting judgments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about complex matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the critical accounting policies described below reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  sales incentives and sales returns  deferred costs of revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense  estimation of restructuring accrual and litigation  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets 
revenue recognition we must make significant management judgments and estimates to determine revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and the net revenue on our consolidated statement of income 
estimates regarding revenue affect all of our operating geographies 
our revenue is derived primarily from three sources i services and support revenue  which includes maintenance  training and consulting revenue  ii subscription revenue  which includes revenue from subscription based offerings and iii product revenue  which includes hardware and perpetual licenses revenue 
we present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  and related interpretations to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware products that include software 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not separate the license fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved or software is incidental  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when all of the following are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents persuasive evidence is generally a binding purchase order or license agreement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier or upon delivery of a grant letter and license key  if applicable 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms of typically to days  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fees and recognize revenue upon cash receipt  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we enter into perpetual and subscription software license agreements through direct sales to consumer customers and indirect sales with partners  distributors and resellers 
we recognize revenue from the indirect sales channel upon sell through by the partner or distributor 
the license agreements generally include service and support agreements  for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
all revenue derived from our online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period 
professional services revenue is generally recognized as services are performed or if required  upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements with multiple elements  including software licenses  maintenance and or services  we allocate and defer revenue equivalent to the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as product revenue 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately or upon substantive renewal rates stated in a contract 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to our customers 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period generally as services and support revenue 
sales incentives and sales returns we reduce revenue for estimates of sales incentives and sales returns 
we offer sales incentives  including channel rebates  marketing funds and end user rebates for products in our corporate and consumer product lines 
additionally  end users may return our products  subject to varying limitations  through distributors and resellers or to us directly for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience 
in each accounting period  we must make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue 
these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of income and affect our net accounts receivable  deferred revenue or accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheet 
these estimates affect all of our operating geographies 
at december   our allowance for sales returns and incentives was million compared to million at december  if our allowance for sales returns and incentives were to increase by  or million  our net revenue would decrease by million and our deferred revenue would decrease by million for the year ended december  deferred costs of revenue deferred costs of revenue  which consist primarily of costs related to revenue sharing arrangements and costs of inventory sold into our channel which have not been sold through to the end user  are included in prepaid expenses and prepaid taxes and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we only defer direct and incremental costs related to revenue sharing arrangements and recognize such deferred costs proportionate to the related revenue recognized 
at december   our deferred costs were million compared to million at december  allowance for doubtful accounts we also make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  current and historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for any account receivable for which collection is considered doubtful 
these estimates affect the general and administrative line item on our statement of income and 
table of contents the net accounts receivable line item on the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimation of uncollectible accounts affects all of our operating geographies 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million compared to million at december  if an additional of our gross accounts receivable were deemed to be uncollectible at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts would increase by million and our provision for bad debt expense  revenue and deferred revenue would also be affected 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  and supersedes apb sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards on their grant dates 
our share based awards include stock options  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan espp 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized stock based compensation expense of and million  respectively 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  we applied the intrinsic value method set forth in apb to calculate the compensation expense for share based awards 
during  we recognized a charge of million under apb related to grant date intrinsic value resulting from revised accounting measurement dates  the exchange of mcafee 
com options in  options which were repriced in and restricted stock awards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our option awards and employee stock purchase rights issued under our espp 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the option  as well as future volatility and the risk free interest rate 
for options issued during  we estimated the weighted average fair value to be 
we did not issue any employee stock purchase rights during the key assumptions that we used to calculate these values are provided below years ended december  stock option grants risk free interest rate weighted average expected lives years volatility dividend yield espp risk free interest rate weighted average expected lives years volatility dividend yield we derive the expected term of our options through a lattice model that factors in historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
since january   we have used the implied volatility of options traded on our stock with a term of one year or more to calculate the expected volatility of our option grants 
prior to that time  the expected volatility was based solely on the historical volatility of our stock 
we have not declared any dividends on our stock in the past and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
the assumptions that we have made represent our management s best estimate  but they are highly subjective and inherently uncertain 
if management had made different assumptions  our calculation of the options fair value and the resulting stock based compensation expense could differ  perhaps materially  from the amounts recognized 
table of contents in our financial statements 
for example  if we increased the assumption regarding our stock s volatility for options granted during by  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
this increased expense would be amortized over the options year vesting period 
likewise  if we increased our assumption of the expected lives of options granted during by one year  our stock based compensation expense would increase by million  net of expected forfeitures 
this increased expense would be amortized over the options year vesting period 
in addition to the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of our options  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of all share based awards and only recognize expense for those awards we expect to vest 
the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
if we were to change our estimate of forfeiture rates  the amount of share based compensation could differ  perhaps materially  from the amount recognized in our financial statements 
for example  if we had decreased our estimate of expected forfeitures by  our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   net of expected forfeitures  would have increased by million 
this decrease in our estimate of expected forfeitures would increase the amount of expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards and units that have not yet been recognized by million  amortized over a weighted average period of years 
estimation of restructuring accrual and litigation restructuring accrual 
we record facility restructuring charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for exit costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
to determine our restructuring charges and the corresponding liabilities  sfas requires us to make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included estimated sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we develop these assumptions based on our understanding of the current real estate market in the respective locations as well as current market interest rates 
the assumptions used are our management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
if  at december   our estimated sublease income were to decrease  the restructuring reserve and related expense would have increased by million 
the estimates regarding our restructuring accruals affect our current liabilities and other long term liabilities line items in our consolidated balance sheet  since these liabilities will be settled each year through these estimates affect our statement of income in the restructuring line item 
litigation 
management s current estimated range of liability related to litigation that is brought against us from time to time is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss as there is no better point of estimate 
because of the uncertainties related to an unfavorable outcome of litigation  and the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is often unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as litigation progresses  we continue to assess our potential liability and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
estimates of litigation liability affect our accrued liability line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our general and administrative expense line item on our statement of income 
see note in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess and make significant estimates regarding the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation 
table of contents allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
estimates related to income taxes affect the deferred tax asset and liability line items and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and our income tax expense line item in our statement of income 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
the valuation allowance is recorded due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits and net operating losses of acquired companies 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical experience and estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
tax returns are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
although we believe that adequate accruals have been made each period for unsettled issues  additional benefits or expenses could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding matters 
we record additional expenses each period on unsettled issues relating to the expected interest we would be required to pay a tax authority if we do not prevail on an unsettled issue 
we continue to assess our potential tax liability included in accrued taxes in the consolidated financial statements  and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
we have classified a portion of our tax liability as non current in the consolidated balance sheet based on the expected timing of cash payments to settle contingencies with taxing authorities 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets we account for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of amortization for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles and at least an annual test for impairment 
an impairment review may be performed more frequently in the event circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we are required to make estimates regarding the fair value of our reporting units when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
we estimate cash flows for these purposes using internal budgets based on recent and historical trends 
we base these estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate the carrying value for each of our reporting units 
if an impairment were present  these estimates would affect an impairment line item on our consolidated statement of income and would affect the goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet 
as goodwill is allocated to all of our reporting units  any impairment could potentially affect each operating geography 
based on our most recent impairment test  there would have to be a significant change in assumptions used in such calculation in order for an impairment to occur as of december  we account for finite lived intangibles and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under this standard we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many of the factors  noted below as triggering factors  which may change in the near term 

table of contents factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not hold any other indefinite lived intangibles as of december  and net finite lived intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively

we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business and our business outlook

financing activities our financing activities for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands years ended december  proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock option plan and stock purchase plans excess tax benefits from stock based compensation repurchase of common stock net cash provided by used in financing activities stock option and stock purchase plans historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
beginning in july  we suspended purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  returned all withholdings to our participating employees  including interest based on a per annum interest rate  and prohibited our employees from exercising stock options due to the announced investigation into our historical stock option granting practices and our inability to become current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we plan to reinstate our espp with a six month offering period  a discount and a six month look back feature beginning in the quarter ending june  in  we changed our equity compensation program for existing employees by starting to grant  in certain instances  restricted stock units in addition to awarding stock options 
we continued to grant stock options to new employees 
although management and our compensation committee have not determined what type of equity compensation we will use to reward top performing employees in the future  if management and our compensation committee decide to grant only restricted stock units  which provide no proceeds to us  our proceeds from the issuance of common stock will be significantly less than proceeds that we received historically 
in the first quarter of  we granted million stock options  million restricted stock units and million performance based restricted stock units 

table of contents excess tax benefits from stock based compensation the excess tax benefit reflected as a financing cash inflow in and represents excess tax benefits realized relating to share based payments to our employees and directors  in accordance with sfas r 
there is a corresponding cash outflow included in cash flows from operating activities

beginning in may  we suspended repurchases of our common stock in the open market due to the announced investigation into our historical stock option granting practices 
our authorization to repurchase shares in the open market expired in october  prior to our becoming current on our reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  on december  therefore  in  we had no repurchases of our common stock pursuant to a publicly announced plan or program 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions through july  depending upon market conditions  share price and other factors 
during and  we used million and million  respectively  to repurchase shares of common stock in connection with our obligation to certain holders of restricted stock to withhold the number of shares required to satisfy such holder s tax liability in connection with the vesting of such shares 
these shares were not part of the publicly announced repurchase program 
contractual obligations a summary of our fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases other commitments purchase obligations total operating leases are for office space and office equipment 
the operating lease commitments above reflect contractual and reasonably assured rent escalations under the lease arrangements 
the majority of our lease contractual obligations relate to the following five leases million for the santa clara  california facility lease  million for the slough  united kingdom facility lease  million for the cork  ireland facility lease and million for the bangalore  india facility lease 
other commitments are minimum commitments on telecom contracts  contractual commitments for naming rights and advertising services and software licensing agreements and royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
we generally issue purchase orders to our contract manufacturers with delivery dates from four to six weeks from the purchase order date 
in addition  we regularly provide such contract manufacturers with rolling six month forecasts of product requirements for planning and long lead time parts procurement purposes only 
we are committed to accept delivery of materials pursuant to our purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such order or allow us to cancel orders beyond certain agreed lead times 
such cancellations may or may not include cancellation costs payable by us 
if we are unable to adequately manage our contract manufacturers and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  we may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes on january  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had approximately million of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to uncertain tax positions 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities  we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur 
in addition to the contractual obligations above and as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not limited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion or all of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our subsidiaries are owned by us and are fully consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
credit facility we have a million euro credit facility with a bank 
the credit facility is available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the credit facility will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between us and the bank at the time of each specific transaction 
the credit facility is intended to be used for short term credit requirements  with terms of one year or less 
the credit facility can be cancelled at any time 
no balances were outstanding as of december  and december  financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency risk as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our functional currency is typically the currency of the local country 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in europe  latin america  and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the euro  the british pound  and the brazilian real 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
to reduce exposures associated with nonfunctional net monetary asset positions in various currencies  we enter into forward contracts 
our foreign exchange contracts typically range from one to three months in original maturity 
we have not hedged anticipated foreign currency cash flows nor do we enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivatives for speculative purposes 
at december  and  the fair value of our forward contracts outstanding was less than million and million  respectively 
forward contracts existing during and did not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly were marked to 
table of contents market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the interest and other income line on the consolidated statements of income 
during  net realized gains arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were million 
net realized losses arising from the settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were million and million in and  respectively 
forward contracts outstanding at december  are presented below in thousands december  notional us dollar equivalent fair value euro british pound sterling brazilian real we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on net revenue 
a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of december  indicated that a hypothetical and appreciation of the us dollar from its value at december  would decrease the fair value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
a and depreciation of the dollar from its value at december  would increase the fair value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk investments we maintain balances in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
all financial instruments used are in accordance with our investment policy 
we maintain our investment securities in portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities including money market  government agency  mortgage backed and investment grade corporate bonds 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons 
beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest and dividends at december  ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income at six and twelve month time horizons
