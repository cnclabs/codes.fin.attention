executive summary description of business alliant energy is an investor owned public utility holding company whose primary subsidiaries are ipl  wpl  resources and corporate services 
ipl is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electric energy  and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in iowa and minnesota 
wpl is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electric energy  and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in wisconsin 
resources is the parent company for alliant energy s non regulated businesses 
corporate services provides administrative services to alliant energy and its subsidiaries 
alliant energy manages three primary businesses as defined below utility business ipl and wpl  non regulated businesses resources and subsidiaries  and alliant energy parent and other 
utility business ipl and wpl own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal  natural gas and renewable resources 
the output from these generating facilities  supplemented with purchased power  is used to provide electric service to approximately million electric customers in the upper midwest 
the utility business also procures natural gas from various suppliers to provide service to approximately  retail gas customers in the upper midwest 
alliant energy s utility business is its primary source of earnings and cash flows 
the earnings and cash flows from the utility business are sensitive to various external factors including  but not limited to  the impact of weather on electric and gas sales volumes  the amount and timing of rate relief approved by regulatory authorities and other factors listed in risk factors and forward looking statements 
non regulated businesses resources manages a relatively small portfolio of businesses through two distinct platforms non regulated generation manages electric generating facilities and other non regulated investments includes investments in environmental consulting  engineering and renewable energy services  transportation and several other modest investments 
alliant energy parent and other includes the operations of alliant energy the parent holding company as well as corporate services 
summary of historical results of operations alliant energy s earnings per weighted average common share eps were as follows income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss additional details regarding alliant energy s net income loss were as follows in millions continuing operations utility non regulated resources alliant energy parent and other interest income  taxes  and administrative and general income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss alliant energy s eps were different from the eps reported in alliant energy s press release issued on feb 
 due to adjustments made to eps after issuance of that press release  primarily due to an increase in the estimated reserve for rate refunds to wholesale customers of wpl 
vs 
summary increased earnings from alliant energy s utility business in as compared to were primarily due to ipl s after tax gain of million per share from selling its electric transmission assets in  increased electric margins resulting from improved fuel cost recoveries and weather related impacts  lower costs from retirement and incentive compensation plans and the accretive effect of fewer shares outstanding following the completion of alliant energy s common stock repurchase program in the third quarter of these items were partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate in  costs related to major winter storms in ipl s service territory in and lower gas margins due to reduced gains from wpl s discontinued performance based gas commodity recovery program 
the lower results from continuing operations for alliant energy s non regulated businesses in as compared to were primarily due to the after tax gain of million per share from selling alliant energy new zealand ltd 
aenz stock in this decrease was partially offset by after tax debt reduction charges of million per share in  a lower effective income tax rate partially due to million per share of reversals of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in resulting from changes in alliant energy s anticipated ability to utilize capital losses prior to their expiration  a million after tax loss per share from selling steam turbine equipment in  lower interest costs  currency related losses from aenz in prior to its sale and improved earnings from its non regulated generation and windconnect businesses in vs 
summary increased earnings from alliant energy s utility business in were primarily due to lower nuclear related operating expenses resulting from the sales of its interests in its two nuclear facilities  the duane arnold energy center daec and the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee  in january and july  respectively  an under recovery of retail fuel related costs at wpl in  impacts of an updated depreciation study implemented at ipl on jan 
 and higher weather normalized retail electric and gas sales 
these increases were substantially offset by higher nuclear related capacity costs from purchased power agreements ppas entered into with the new owners of daec and kewaunee upon the sales of these facilities  higher incentive compensation related expenses and the net impacts of weather and weather hedging activities on alliant energy s electric margins 
the improved results from continuing operations for alliant energy s non regulated businesses were largely due to after tax  asset valuation charges of million per share recorded in related to alliant energy s brazil investments  which alliant energy sold in the first quarter of  and an after tax gain on the sale of aenz stock of million per share in these increases were partially offset by increased after tax charges related to further debt reductions at resources of million per share in compared to million per share in the increased earnings were also partially offset by after tax foreign currency transaction losses of million per share incurred in associated with alliant energy s new zealand investments  million per share of income realized in related to adjustments of deferred income tax valuation allowances resulting from changes in alliant energy s anticipated ability to utilize capital losses prior to their expiration  a million after tax loss per share from the sale of steam turbine equipment in and tax adjustments recorded in refer to alliant energy s results of operations  ipl s results of operations and wpl s results of operations for additional details regarding the various factors impacting their respective earnings during  and strategic overview summary alliant energy is committed to maintaining sustained  long term strong financial performance with a strong balance sheet and credit ratings 
alliant energy expects this strong financial performance to help ensure access to capital markets at reasonable costs as alliant energy embarks on a substantial infrastructure investment program discussed in utility generation plan below and liquidity and capital resources environmental later in mda 
alliant energy believes it is well positioned to implement its strategic plan following the divestiture of numerous utility and non regulated businesses discussed in business divestitures below 
alliant energy s utility business is expected to provide the majority of alliant energy s earnings and cash flows in the future and the larger share of its long term earnings growth through investments in new generation and environmental compliance projects  by earning returns authorized by regulators and by continuing its focus on controlling costs 
alliant energy is utilizing a comprehensive lean six sigma program to assist it in generating cost savings and operational efficiencies in both its utility and non regulated businesses 
utilities as primary business platform alliant energy s utility business is the growth platform within its strategic plan  and is where alliant energy expects to invest substantially all of its capital expenditures in  and refer to liquidity and capital resources cash flows from used for investing activities construction and acquisition expenditures for additional information regarding capital expenditure forecasts 
the strategic plan for alliant energy s utility operations is concentrated on building and maintaining the generation and infrastructure necessary to provide alliant energy s utility customers with safe  reliable and environmentally sound energy service  earning returns authorized by its regulators  and controlling costs to mitigate potential rate increases 
laws in iowa hf and wisconsin act provide utility companies in those states with the ability to receive rate making principles and resulting increased regulatory and investment certainty prior to making certain significant investments in new generation 
these laws enable alliant energy to pursue additional generation investments in its utility business to serve its customers and to provide shareowners with greater certainty regarding the returns on these investments 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for additional information on these laws 
focused approach to non regulated operations the strategic plan for alliant energy s non regulated operations involves maintaining a relatively small portfolio of lower risk  mature businesses  which are accretive to earnings but not significant users of capital 
consistent with this strategic focus  alliant energy completed the divestiture of numerous non regulated businesses in the past five years 
refer to non regulated business divestitures below for details of non regulated asset divestiture activity in utility generation plan alliant energy s current utility generation plan for the to time period reflects the need to increase generation in both iowa and wisconsin 
the proposed new generation is expected to meet increasing customer demand  reduce reliance on ppas and mitigate the impacts of any future plant retirements 
alliant energy will continue to purchase energy and capacity in the market and intends to remain a net purchaser of both  but at a reduced level assuming the successful completion of these generation projects 
the plan also reflects continued commitments to alliant energy s energy efficiency and environmental compliance programs 
alliant energy continues to monitor developments related to federal and state renewable portfolio standards  environmental requirements for new generation and federal and state tax incentives 
alliant energy reviews and updates  as deemed necessary and in accordance with regulatory requirements  its utility generation plan and expects to adjust its plan as needed to meet any of these standards or to react to any market factors increasing or decreasing the availability or cost effectiveness of the various renewable energy technologies and other alternatives to its utility generation plan

instead  wpl will proceed with applying traditional rate making procedures for the recovery of and return on its capital costs for this wind farm 
neenah energy facility nef in april  wpl filed for approval from the pscw to purchase resources mw  simple cycle  natural gas fired electric generating facility in neenah  wisconsin 
wpl intends to replace the output currently obtained under the rockgen energy center rockgen ppa with output from nef 
wpl currently plans to acquire nef effective june   which coincides with the expected termination of wpl s rockgen ppa scheduled for may  wpl plans to file for approval from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for the nef purchase in the first half of after receipt of pscw approval 
whispering willow in february  ipl received approval from the iowa utilities board iub to construct the project  which includes a return on common equity of and a year depreciable life for up to mw of capacity 
the expected commercial operation date of the mw of capacity is subject to the availability of wind turbines 
ipl has secured development rights on an additional mw of capacity in franklin county  iowa 
future development of the balance of the wind farm will depend on numerous factors such as renewable portfolio standards and availability of wind turbines 
wpl s wind project in minnesota wpl plans to file for approval from the pscw and the minnesota public utilities commission mpuc in the first half of to construct a mw wind farm in southern minnesota 
wpl expects to use traditional rate making procedures for the recovery of and return on its capital costs for this wind farm 
the expected commercial operation date is subject to the timing of pending regulatory approvals and availability of wind turbines 
nelson dewey the preferred site of the new facility is adjacent to the existing nelson dewey generating station nelson dewey in cassville  wisconsin 
in february  wpl filed for approval from the pscw to proceed with construction of the new facility and to specify in advance rate making principles 
in its regulatory application  wpl requested a return on common equity of along with a capital structure that includes a common equity ratio 
in december  the pscw determined wpl s cpcn application was complete  thereby initiating the construction permitting process 
by law  the pscw has up to days days plus an optional day extension from the date the application was determined complete to make a final ruling on the proposed expansion 
wpl has selected washington group international to provide engineering  procurement  and construction services for the proposed expansion 
the current cost estimate includes expenditures for facilities that will be shared with the existing units at cassville  wisconsin 
of the total estimated expenditures for the shared facilities  million is anticipated to be allocated to the existing units based on installed capacity 
wpl plans to utilize circulating fluidized bed technology and biomass fuel capability for the new facility 
sutherland the site of the new facility is adjacent to the existing sutherland generating station sutherland in marshalltown  iowa 
in july  ipl filed for approval from the iub to proceed with construction of the new mw coal fired electric generating facility  which also includes an additional mw equivalent of steam cogeneration for use by nearby industries 
in november  ipl  central iowa power cooperative cipco and corn belt power cooperative corn belt signed a joint operating agreement indicating plans for joint ownership in the facility 
ipl expects to utilize up to mw of output  while cipco and corn belt will each utilize mw of output 
additionally  ipl continues to negotiate with other potential partners for the remaining output 
ipl plans to file for advanced rate making principles with the iub for its share of the cost of the facility no later than march ipl plans to utilize super critical pulverized coal technology and biomass fuel capability for the new facility 
in february  ipl proposed to permanently reduce its generating fleet s greenhouse gas ghg emissions by retiring certain coal fired generating units lansing units and and switching the fuel source of certain other coal fired units to natural gas all dubuque units when sutherland becomes available in ipl will file these proposed changes with the iub as part of its application for advanced rate making principles for sutherland these proposed changes to ipl s generating fleet are contingent upon ipl receiving all applicable regulatory approvals related to site certification and advanced rate making principles applications for sutherland other wpl has a ppa with a subsidiary of calpine corporation related to the riverside energy center riverside that extends through may  and provides wpl the option to purchase riverside at the end of the ppa term 
for planning purposes  wpl is currently assuming it will exercise its option to purchase riverside  a mw natural gas fired electric generating facility in beloit  wisconsin  to replace the output currently obtained under the ppa

business divestitures alliant energy completed the divestiture of numerous utility and non regulated businesses during the last five years in order to strengthen its financial profile and narrow its strategic and risk profile 
proceeds from these divestitures have been used primarily for debt reduction  common share repurchases  funding capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the following includes various divestitures completed in utility business divestitures in december  ipl completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in iowa  minnesota and illinois to itc midwest llc itc and received net proceeds of million  subject to post closing adjustments 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the ipl electric transmission assets sale 
in february  ipl and wpl completed the sale of their respective electric distribution and gas properties in illinois and received  in the aggregate  net proceeds of million 
non regulated business divestitures in june  alliant energy completed the sale of its investment in mexico and received net proceeds of million 
the operating results of alliant energy s investment in mexico have been reported as discontinued operations 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding alliant energy s discontinued operations 
rates and regulatory matters overview alliant energy has two utility subsidiaries  ipl and wpl 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries are subject to federal regulation by ferc  which has jurisdiction over wholesale electric rates  electric transmission and certain natural gas facilities  and state regulation in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota for retail utility rates and standards of service 
such regulatory oversight also covers ipl s and wpl s plans for construction and financing of new generation facilities and related activities 
utility rate cases details of alliant energy s rate cases impacting its historical and future results of operations are as follows dollars in millions  electric e  gas g  not applicable n a  to be determined tbd  fuel related f r  fourth quarter q return interim interim final final on utility filing increase increase effective increase effective common utility rate case type date requested granted a date granted a date equity wpl retail e g n a n a tbd tbd tbd retail e n a n a wholesale e b b b tbd tbd tbd retail e g n a n a retail f r e q n a retail f r e n a retail e g n a n a wholesale e n a ipl mn retail e ia retail g ia retail e c a interim rate relief is implemented  subject to refund  pending determination of final rates

c emery generating station and other 
wpl s retail rate case in february  wpl filed a request with the pscw to increase current retail electric rates by million  or approximately  and reduce current retail gas rates by million  or approximately  effective jan 
 the electric request is based on a test year with approval to reopen the case to address limited cost drivers for the electric request reflects recovery for increased spending on electric generation infrastructure  environmental compliance and stewardship  enhanced investment in renewable energy purchasing and projects  stepped up customer energy efficiency and conservation efforts  and related electric transmission and distribution costs 
the gas request is based on an average of and costs 
the request is based on the previously authorized return on common equity of 
wpl s retail rate case in april  wpl filed a request with the pscw to reopen its retail rate case for the limited purpose of increasing electric retail rates in an amount equal to deferral credits that were fully amortized on dec 
 wpl also requested clarification that it is authorized to record afudc on all cwip balances in excess of the cwip balance included in the test year 
in november  the pscw issued a final written order approving an annual electric retail rate increase of million effective jan 
 and approving wpl s requested clarification regarding afudc and cwip 
wpl s wholesale rate case in december  wpl received an order from ferc authorizing an interim increase  subject to refund  effective in june related to wpl s request to implement a formula rate structure for its wholesale electric customers 
the proposed rate structure uses formulas based on historical data for capacity related costs  which adjust annually on june  and for energy costs  including fuel  which adjust monthly to determine applicable wholesale rates 
based on costs and usage  interim rates implemented on june  resulted in an annual revenue increase of approximately million 
this represents an increase of from previously approved rates  which were based on a forecasted test year 
final rates to be approved by ferc may result from a settlement process or fully litigated process 
wpl and its wholesale customers are currently engaged in settlement discussions  which have resulted in a settlement of the issues identified in wpl s filing requesting the formula rate structure 
final written agreements were filed in february and  if approved by ferc  will result in an over collection of revenues beginning june  wpl will refund the over collection  with interest  upon ferc approval in accordance with ferc requirements 
anticipated refunds of million related to revenues collected during the june  through dec 
 time period have been fully accrued as of dec 
 wpl s retail rate case in january  wpl received an order from the pscw approving a net increase in electric and gas retail rates of million effective in january the final increase granted was lower than the increase requested largely due to a decrease in forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs for the test period 
the pscw approval included a regulatory capital structure with equity compared to requested  a return on common equity of compared to requested and lengthened certain regulatory asset amortization periods 
the regulatory capital structure approved by the pscw was determined by adjusting wpl s financial capital structure by approximately million compared to million requested of imputed debt largely from the kewaunee and riverside ppas 
the lower imputed debt adjustment than requested was primarily the result of the pscw denying wpl s request to include the sheboygan falls energy facility sfef lease in the regulatory capital structure calculation 
in addition  as a result of a pscw audit of plant costs  the pscw determined that wpl should have used an after tax afudc rate instead of a pre tax afudc rate 
wpl has made the required entries in to reflect this change and will record afudc at the after tax rate for future retail jurisdiction construction projects 
pursuant to the january order  wpl was allowed recovery of a portion of the previously deferred loss associated with the sale of kewaunee in july and recovery of previously deferred costs associated with the extension of the unplanned outage at kewaunee prior to the sale 
the pscw order included recovery of million of these deferred costs through increased retail electric rates charged by wpl over a two year recovery period 
the january pscw order also approved modifications to wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism which included of all gains and losses from wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism beginning in to be retained by wpl  with the remaining refunded to or recovered from customers 
the pscw also directed wpl to work with pscw staff to help the pscw determine if it may be necessary to reevaluate the current benchmarks for wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism or explore a modified one for one pass through of gas costs to retail customers 
in october  the pscw issued an order providing wpl the option to choose to utilize a modified gas performance incentive sharing mechanism or switch to a modified one for one pass through of gas costs to retail customers using benchmarks 
wpl evaluated the alternatives and chose to implement the modified one for one pass through of gas costs  which was effective nov 
 in may  wpl notified the pscw that its actual average fuel related costs for the month of march had fallen below the monthly fuel monitoring range set in wpl s retail rate case and that projected average fuel related costs for could be below the annual monitoring range to an extent that would warrant a decrease in retail electric rates 
wpl s notification also included a request for the pscw to set wpl s retail electric rates subject to refund 
in june  the pscw issued an order approving wpl s request to set retail electric rates subject to refund effective june  in august  wpl received approval from the pscw to refund to its retail electric customers any over recovery of retail fuel related costs during the period june  through dec 
 wpl estimates the over recovery of retail fuel related costs during this period to be million  including interest 
wpl refunded to its retail electric customers million in and million during the first two months of wpl plans to file for approval with the pscw by march   its final refund report 
at dec 
  wpl reserved for the remaining amounts anticipated to be paid to retail electric customers related to these refunds 
wpl s fuel related retail rate case in september  the pscw approved a settlement agreement submitted by wpl and interveners that established final fuel related retail rates at a level reflective of actual fuel costs incurred from july  through june  the approval also allowed previously deferred  incremental purchased power energy costs associated with coal conservation efforts at wpl due to coal delivery disruptions to be included in the actual fuel costs and resolved all issues in the rate case regarding risk management activities and forecasting methodologies 
wpl refunded million to customers in october related to amounts collected in excess of final rates through june as part of the settlement  wpl also agreed to refund any over collection of fuel costs in the second half of in june  the pscw approved a million refund  including interest  to wpl s retail customers related to the over collection of retail fuel related costs during the second half of wpl completed the refund in august other utility rate case information with the exception of recovering a return on additions to ipl s and wpl s infrastructure  a significant portion of the rate increases included in the above table reflect a reduction in the amortization of deferred credits or the recovery of increased costs incurred or expected to be incurred by ipl and wpl 
thus  these increases in revenues are not expected to result in a significant increase in net income to either ipl or wpl  as applicable 
rate making principles for new electric generating facilities iowa and wisconsin each have laws hf in iowa and act in wisconsin that allow a public utility that proposes to purchase or construct an electric generating facility in its respective state to apply to its state regulatory commission for an order that specifies in advance the rate making principles that the state regulatory commission will apply to certain electric generating facility costs in future rate making proceedings 
both of these laws are designed to give utilities in these states more regulatory certainty  including providing utilities with a fixed rate of return and recovery period for these investments  when financing electric generation projects 
however  the regulatory approval process to build new generation is different between the state jurisdictions as noted below 
ipl and wpl plan to utilize the rate making principles included in hf and act  respectively  for some of the electric generation facilities included in alliant energy s utility generation plan 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan for additional details of alliant energy s utility generation plan including discussion of the pscw s may decision regarding wpl s application for advance rate making principles for its cedar ridge wind project wpl subsequently did not accept the pscw s decision  the iub s february decision regarding ipl s application for advance rate making principles for mw of its whispering willow wind project and wpl s application for advance rate making principles for its proposed coal fired generating facility in cassville  wisconsin 
iowa under hf in iowa  a utility must file for advance rate making principles for the construction of certain electric generating facilities located in iowa including new base load primarily defined as nuclear or coal fired generation facilities with a capacity of mw or more  combined cycle natural gas fired facilities of any size and renewable generating resources  such as wind facilities  of any size 
the project  if approved  must be constructed using the advance rate making principles ordered by the iub or not constructed at all 
the iub must issue the advance rate making principles for a base load coal plant prior to the start of construction if the iub finds that the utility requesting the principles has an energy efficiency plan in effect and that the utility has demonstrated that the coal plant is reasonable when compared to other feasible alternative sources of supply 
in addition  a certificate of public convenience  use and necessity is required for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in iowa with mw or more of capacity 
wisconsin under act in wisconsin  a utility seeking to construct an electric generating facility has the option to seek advance rate making treatment for that facility 
a wisconsin utility therefore is not obligated to file for advance rate making principles 
also  under act a utility can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate making if the terms of the pscw order on the advance rate making principles are viewed as unsatisfactory to the utility 
a certificate of authority ca application is required for the construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in wisconsin with mw or less of capacity 
a certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn application is required for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in wisconsin with mw or more of capacity 
in both situations  construction may not commence until the pscw has granted approval based on a finding that the project is in the public interest 
in addition  wpl s ownership and operation of electric generating facilities outside of wisconsin including minnesota to serve wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the pscw 
afudc new electric generating facilities require large outlays of capital and long periods of time to construct resulting in significant financing costs 
financing costs incurred by utilities during construction are generally included as part of the cwip cost of the new generating facility through accruals of afudc 
in november  the pscw issued its written order for wpl s retail electric rate case which authorizes wpl to record afudc on all cwip balances in excess of the cwip balance used to determine base rates in the test year 
general rate making principles provide ipl and wpl the ability to recover afudc after the asset is placed in service 
pre certification and pre construction expenditures new electric generating facilities require material expenditures for planning and siting these facilities prior to receiving approval from regulatory commissions to begin construction 
these expenditures are commonly referred to as pre certification costs and pre construction costs 
pre certification costs generally are characterized as incremental costs related to planning and investigation studies incurred to determine the feasibility of utility projects under contemplation for construction and regulatory approval 
pre construction costs generally are characterized as capital expenditures made prior to beginning construction of capital projects requiring regulatory approval 
ipl and wpl recognize these pre certification and pre construction costs as regulatory assets on their respective consolidated balance sheets prior to regulatory approval of the project or prior to management s decision to proceed with the project if no regulatory approvals are required 
upon regulatory approval or when management decides to proceed with a project that does not require regulatory approval  ipl s cumulative pre certification and pre construction costs and wpl s cumulative pre construction costs for each project are transferred from regulatory assets to cwip on their respective consolidated balance sheets 
wpl s cumulative pre certification costs for each project remain in regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheet until recovered from customers through changes in future base rates 
ipl does not begin to recognize afudc or carrying costs on pre certification and pre construction costs incurred until the cumulative project costs are transferred into cwip 
wpl recognizes afudc on pre construction costs and recovery of short term debt carrying costs for pre certification costs based on regulatory orders 
wpl has received approval from the pscw to defer pre certification costs and pre construction costs related to its cedar ridge wind project and nelson dewey base load coal project 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan and note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details on these costs 
utility fuel cost recovery ipl s retail electric and retail gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric and retail gas tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in commodity costs thereby mitigating price risk for prudently incurred commodity costs 
such rate mechanisms significantly reduce commodity price risk associated with ipl s retail electric and retail gas margins and wpl s wholesale electric and retail gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins  however  are more exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs as discussed below 
wpl s retail electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism wpl s retail electric rates are based on forecasts of forward looking test periods and include estimates of future monthly fuel related costs includes fuel and purchased energy costs anticipated during the test period 
during each electric retail rate proceeding  the pscw sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges  the pscw can authorize an adjustment to future retail electric rates 
the fuel monitoring ranges set by the pscw include three different ranges based on monthly costs  cumulative costs and annual costs during the test period 
in order for wpl to be authorized to file for a proceeding to change rates related to fuel related costs during the test period  wpl must demonstrate a that either any actual monthly costs during the test period exceeded the monthly ranges or the actual cumulative costs to date during the test period exceeded the cumulative ranges  and b that the annual projected costs that include cumulative actual costs for the test period also exceed the annual ranges 
wpl  the pscw or any other affected party may initiate a proceeding to change rates due to changes in fuel related costs during the monitoring period based on the above criteria 
in january  the pscw approved an order changing wpl s fuel cost monitoring ranges to plus or minus for the monthly range  for the cumulative range  plus or minus for the first month  plus or minus for the second month  and plus or minus for the remaining months of the monitoring period  and plus or minus for the annual range 
the pscw attempts to authorize  after a required hearing  interim fuel related rate increases within days of notice to customers 
any such change in rates would be effective prospectively and would require a refund with interest at the authorized return on common equity if final rates are determined to be lower than interim rates approved 
rate decreases due to decreases in fuel related costs can be implemented without a hearing 
the rules also include a process whereby wisconsin utilities can seek deferral treatment of emergency changes in fuel related costs between fuel related or base rate cases 
such deferrals would be subject to review  approval and recovery in future fuel related or base retail rate cases 
potential changes to wpl s electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism in february  wpl and certain other investor owned utilities jointly filed with the pscw proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
the proposal recommends each utility annually file a forecast of total fuel related costs and sales for the upcoming month period  which will be used to determine fuel related rates for such period 
any under or over collection of actual fuel related costs  in excess of plus or minus  for a utility during such month period would be reflected in an escrow account  with interest for that utility 
the balance of the escrow account at the end of each year would be included in the forecast of total fuel related costs for the following month period allowing recovery of under collected costs or refund of over collected costs in each subsequent year 
the proposal also provides the pscw an opportunity to review the actual fuel related costs for each month period to ensure the fuel related costs were prudent 
the definition of fuel related costs would also be expanded to specifically include midwest independent system operator miso energy market costs and revenues  emission allowance and trading costs and revenues  renewable resource credit costs and revenues and other variable operation and maintenance costs 
in may  pscw commissioners directed pscw staff to draft proposed new retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin similar to the joint utility proposal filed with the pscw in february the major differences between the joint utility proposal and the current pscw staff draft rules include the pscw staff draft rules include a plus or minus threshold for changes in rate recovery compared to the level included in the joint utility proposal  the pscw staff draft rules propose an annual deferral accounting process instead of the monthly escrow accounting proposed by the joint utilities  and the pscw staff draft rules include an earnings test such that future collection of under collected amounts deferred under these rules may be limited if the individual utility is earning in excess of its authorized return on equity 
the pscw commissioners have not yet indicated whether they will promulgate modifications to the fuel rules and  if so  whether these modifications will reflect the proposed pscw staff draft rules 
formal action by the pscw and subsequent legislative committee review are required before any changes to the current rules could become effective 
wpl is currently unable to predict the final outcome of this initiative 
recent regulatory related legislative developments ghg emissions in november  several midwest state governors including the governors of iowa  minnesota and wisconsin signed the midwestern ghg accord ghg accord 
under the ghg accord  a working group is to be formed to establish a midwestern ghg reduction program that will establish ghg reduction targets and timeframes consistent with member state targets  develop a market based and multi sector cap and trade program to help achieve ghg reductions  establish a system to enable tracking  management  and crediting for entities that reduce ghg emissions  and develop and implement additional steps as needed to achieve the reduction targets  such as a low carbon fuel standards and regional incentives and funding mechanisms 
all undertakings of the ghg accord are to be completed within months after the effective date of the ghg accord  including the development of a proposed cap and trade agreement and model rule within months 
however  further legislative and or regulatory action will be necessary to adopt a model rule in each state or to implement other mandatory mechanisms that may be proposed under the ghg accord 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts the ghg accord will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  an energy related law sf was enacted in minnesota 
in conjunction with the renewable energy standards bill sf enacted in february  sf is intended to reduce minnesota s per capita reliance on fossil fuels for energy and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change 
sf authorizes a climate change advisory group to develop a comprehensive ghg reduction action plan to be delivered to the minnesota legislature for consideration by february and completed by august sf establishes a statewide goal impacting all sectors  including utilities  to reduce ghg emissions by  by  and at least by  from levels 
sf also includes a provision which would preclude  with certain exceptions  alliant energy from the following during the period from aug 
 until a comprehensive ghg reduction plan is enacted constructing a large energy facility in minnesota that would contribute to ghg emissions  importing or committing to import from outside minnesota power from a large facility contributing to ghg emissions  and entering into a long term ppa of mw or more  or exceeding five years in length  that would increase minnesota ghg emissions 
carbon reduction projects  including reductions of ghg emissions at existing facilities or purchase of carbon allowances  which offset an equal or greater amount emitted by any of these actions  will result in exemptions from this provision 
ppas and large facility projects filed or entered into before apr 
  are currently exempted from this provision of sf however  the minnesota legislature may establish limits for these exempted items in the future 
sf also establishes statewide energy conservation and efficiency goals and creates a provision that utilities may file for cost recovery for renewable facilities they own and operate 
utilities are also exempted from the competitive resource acquisition process competitive bidding when constructing  owning and operating generation used to comply with sf s renewable energy standards 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine what impacts sf will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
renewable standards in february  a law sf governing renewable energy was enacted in minnesota 
sf commits certain utilities operating in minnesota  including ipl  to a renewable energy standard res based on retail electric sales from renewable energy sources as a percentage of total retail electric sales in minnesota 
ipl must meet an res of by  by  by  and by utilities in minnesota may meet the requirements of the res with renewable energy generated by the utility  renewable energy acquired under ppas or the use of renewable resource credits 
in march  a law act governing renewable energy was enacted in wisconsin 
act commits wisconsin utilities to a renewable portfolio standard rps using a benchmark of average retail sales of renewable electricity in  and which was approximately for wpl 
wpl must increase renewable retail electric sales as a percentage of total retail electric sales by two percentage points above this benchmark by  and by six percentage points above this benchmark by wisconsin utilities may meet the renewable energy requirements of the rps with renewable energy generated by the utility  renewable energy acquired under ppas or the use of renewable resource credits 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan for discussion of alliant energy s utility generation plan which includes additional supply from wind generation that will contribute towards ipl meeting the res in minnesota and wpl meeting the rps in wisconsin discussed above 
the wind generation proposed by ipl and wpl was selected as an economic source of energy as part of a resource planning process 
each of ipl and wpl will need to add approximately mw of incremental renewable electric supply to their current electric supply portfolio to increase by their respective sales from renewable energy sources as a percentage of their respective total electric sales 
other legislation in february  the economic stimulus act of esa was enacted 
the esa contains various provisions that are intended to provide tax relief to individuals and employers 
the most significant provision for alliant energy  ipl and wpl is a bonus tax depreciation deduction for certain property that is acquired or constructed in alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently evaluating the impacts the esa will have on their financial condition and results of operations 
other recent regulatory developments ipl s electric transmission assets sale in december  ipl completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in iowa  minnesota and illinois to itc 
upon closing the sale  ipl established a regulatory liability of million pursuant to conditions established by the iub in september when they allowed the transaction to proceed 
the regulatory liability represents the present value of ipl s obligation to refund to its customers payments of million per year for eight years beginning in the year ipl s customers experience an increase in rates related to the transmission charges assessed by itc 
the regulatory liability will earn interest at a rate equivalent to the monthly average united states of america us treasury rate for three year maturities 
during the iub hearing process  ipl also committed that it would not file for a common equity ratio in excess of in its next retail electric rate case filed in iowa 
in october  the office of consumer advocate in iowa issued a petition seeking judicial review of the iub s decision to allow the transaction to proceed 
in addition  the mpuc issued its oral decision in december  and the office of the attorney general small business and residential utilities division oag filed a request for a stay and motion for reconsideration with the mpuc 
in february  the mpuc granted oag a rehearing of its petition for reconsideration 
ipl currently does not believe the judicial review of the iub s decision or the oag s request to the mpuc will be successful 
however  ipl cannot provide any assurances that the judicial review or the oag s request will be resolved in a timely or satisfactory manner 
ipl s clean air compliance projects in november  the iub approved an amended emissions plan and budget epb filed by ipl in august in accordance with the iowa code  each rate regulated public utility that is an owner of one or more electric generating facilities fueled by coal and located in the state of iowa is required to file an epb at least bi annually 
an epb provides a utility s compliance plan and related budget to meet applicable state environmental requirements and federal air quality standards 
iub approval demonstrates that the iub believes that ipl s epb is reasonably expected to achieve cost effective compliance with applicable state environmental requirements and federal air quality standards 
wpl s clean air compliance projects in march  the pscw approved the deferral of the retail portion of wpl s incremental pre certification and pre construction costs for current or future clean air compliance rule projects requiring pscw approval  effective with the request date of november wpl currently anticipates that such deferred costs will be recovered in future rates and therefore does not expect these costs to have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
refer to liquidity and capital resources environmental for discussion of wpl s construction application filed with the pscw in the second quarter of to install air pollution controls to reduce sulfur dioxide so emissions at nelson dewey 
advanced metering infrastructure ami in february  the pscw issued an order approving wpl s ca application for construction authority for the installation of both the electric and gas portions of ami in wisconsin 
wpl s capital expenditures for ami are currently estimated to be million million for the electric portion and million for the gas portion 
ipl also plans to install ami in its iowa and minnesota service territories at an estimated cost of million 
conditional upon appropriate cost recovery approvals from regulators and success of a limited initial implementation phase involving approximately  meters  alliant energy currently plans to fully install ami through a phased approach from through ami technology is expected to improve customer service  enhance energy management initiatives and provide operational savings through increased efficiencies 
miso wholesale energy market in august  the pscw issued an order related to the regulatory treatment of certain costs incurred by wpl to participate in the miso market 
the order required wpl to discontinue the deferral of miso costs after dec 
 in addition  the order requires wpl to prove in its next rate case that its retail electric customers were not harmed financially by excluding from its miso deferrals certain costs credits from miso for the time period september through december wpl anticipates that it will be successful in proving this to be true in its next base rate case when it seeks recovery of such deferred costs 
in june  the iub issued an order extending a temporary waiver until june  this waiver allows the costs and credits incurred by ipl to participate in the miso market that relate to its iowa retail customers to be included in ipl s iowa energy adjustment clause 
ipl and wpl are working through the regulatory process to establish long term recovery mechanisms for these costs 
wpl depreciation study in february  the pscw issued an order approving the implementation of updated depreciation rates for wpl effective july  as a result of a recently completed depreciation study

summary electric margins increased million  or  in  primarily due to an increase in weather normalized retail sales volumes  the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities  and the impact of wpl s retail base rate increase  which began in january these increases were partially offset by the impact of annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates during the second quarter  which is discussed below in unbilled revenue estimates  million of higher purchased power capacity costs related to the daec ppa  the impact of ipl s and wpl s sales of their electric distribution properties in illinois in february and the loss of retail sales at ipl during the power outages caused by winter storms in the increase in weather normalized retail sales volumes was largely due to the negative impact high electric prices and other economic conditions during had on customer usage during that period and impacts of ethanol industry growth in alliant energy s service territory 
the impact of wpl s retail base rate increase resulted in retail fuel related rates exceeding retail fuel related costs during the increase in purchased power capacity costs was largely due to one additional month of capacity costs related to the daec ppa in compared to because the daec ppa did not begin until the sale of ipl s interest in the daec was completed in late january vs 
summary electric margins decreased million  or  in  primarily due to million of higher purchased power capacity costs related to the daec and kewaunee ppas and the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of under recoveries of retail fuel related costs at wpl in  an increase in weather normalized retail sales in and million of higher energy conservation revenues at ipl 
changes in energy conservation revenues are largely offset by changes in energy conservation expenses 
impacts of weather conditions excluding the impacts of winter storms in ipl s service territory estimated increases decreases to alliant energy s electric margins from the net impacts of weather and alliant energy s weather hedging activities were as follows in millions weather impacts on demand compared to normal weather losses from weather derivatives a net weather impact a recorded in other revenues in the above table 
alliant energy s electric sales demand is seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning usage by its residential and commercial customers 
cooling degree days cdd data is used to measure the variability of temperatures during summer months and is correlated with electric sales demand 
heating degree days hdd data is used to measure the variability of temperatures during winter months and is correlated with electric and gas sales demand 
refer to utility gas margins impacts of weather conditions for details regarding hdd in alliant energy s service territory 
cdd in alliant energy s service territories were as follows actual cdd a normal a cedar rapids  iowa ipl madison  wisconsin wpl a cdd are calculated using a degree base 
normal degree days are calculated using a year average 
alliant energy utilizes weather derivatives based on cdd and hdd to reduce the potential volatility on its margins during the summer months of june through august and the winter months of november through march  respectively 
alliant energy entered into weather derivatives based on cdd in cedar rapids  iowa and madison  wisconsin for the period june  through aug 
 and weather derivatives based on cdd in chicago  illinois for the periods june  through aug 
 and june  through aug 
 alliant energy entered into weather derivatives based on hdd in cedar rapids  iowa and madison  wisconsin for the period nov 
 through march  and weather derivatives based on hdd in chicago  illinois for the periods nov 
 through march  and nov 
 through march  the weather derivatives utilized for june  through aug 
 did not produce the results expected by alliant energy 
while cdd had historically been highly correlated between chicago  illinois and alliant energy s service territories  this was not the case in as cdd were above normal in chicago  illinois during june through aug 
 compared to below normal in cedar rapids  iowa 
alliant energy estimated this lack of correlation resulted in it incurring losses from the weather derivatives that exceeded by approximately million the positive impact on its demand from the warmer than normal weather conditions during june  through aug 
 in addition  alliant energy estimated the impact on demand compared to normal weather during september  and such months were not covered by weather derivatives was million million at ipl and million at wpl  million million at ipl and million at wpl and million million at ipl and million at wpl  respectively 
fuel and purchased power energy fuel related cost recoveries alliant energy s fuel related costs decreased million  or  and increased million  or  in and  respectively 
these changes in fuel related costs were primarily due to changes in commodity prices and pscw approval for wpl to record million of previously deferred costs associated with coal conservation efforts due to the coal delivery disruptions in electric production fuel and purchased power expense in fuel related commodity prices in were higher than and as well as historic averages largely due to impacts from natural gas disruption caused by hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of due to ipl s rate recovery mechanisms for fuel related costs  changes in fuel related costs resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and  therefore  did not have a significant impact on ipl s electric margins 
wpl s rate recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel related costs also provides for subsequent adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs  thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on its electric margins 
wpl s retail fuel related costs incurred in were lower than the forecasted fuel related costs used to set retail rates during such period 
wpl estimates the lower than forecasted retail fuel related costs increased electric margins by approximately million in  prior to the order regarding wpl s retail fuel related cost recoveries received from the pscw in june in accordance with this order and a related settlement agreement approved by the pscw in august  wpl established reserves of million for rate refund in for the estimated refund related to the over recovery of retail fuel related costs for the months of june through december wpl refunded approximately million of the rate refund to its retail electric customers in  refunded million in the first two months of and plans to refund the remaining reserve of million in wpl s recovery of fuel related costs during did not have a significant impact on its electric margins 
wpl s retail fuel related costs incurred in were higher than the forecasted fuel related costs used to set retail rates during such period 
wpl estimates the higher than forecasted retail fuel related costs decreased electric margins by approximately million in the higher than forecasted retail fuel related costs in were largely due to the impact of incremental purchased power energy costs resulting from an unplanned outage at kewaunee in and the impact of coal supply constraints from the powder river basin in refer to other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions commodity price risk for discussion of risks associated with increased fuel and purchased power energy costs on wpl s electric margins

purchased power capacity costs alliant energy sold its interests in its two nuclear facilities  daec and kewaunee  in january and july  respectively 
prior to the sale of these facilities  the operating expenses related to the facilities consisted primarily of other operation and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses 
upon the sale of the facilities  alliant energy entered into ppas with the new owners of the facilities and its share of the costs associated with these facilities is now recorded as purchased power expense 
as a result  there are large nuclear related variances between periods for these income statement line items  which are somewhat offsetting in nature and also do not capture other benefits from the sales including  among others  the impact of the application of the sales proceeds 
purchased power capacity costs included in electric production fuel and purchased power expense in the electric margin table above related to the daec and kewaunee ppas were as follows in millions daec ppa ipl kewaunee ppa wpl unbilled revenue estimates in the second quarter of each year  when weather impacts on electric sales volumes are historically minimal  alliant energy refines its estimates of unbilled electric revenues

upon completion of these asset sales  ipl and wpl entered into separate wholesale agreements to continue to provide electric services to their former retail customers in illinois 
electric revenues and mwhs sold under these wholesale agreements are included in wholesale sales in the electric margin table above 
the lower pricing for wholesale customers as compared to retail customers resulted in a decrease to electric margins following the sale of the electric distribution properties in illinois 
wholesale sales volumes were higher in compared to largely due to the impacts of weather conditions on wholesale sales demand at wpl 
in addition  wholesale revenues were higher in compared to due to the impacts of higher fuel related cost recovery revenues from wholesale customers at wpl in the changes in revenues caused by changes in fuel related costs were largely offset by changes in electric production fuel and purchased power expense and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric margins 
bulk power and other sales bulk power and other revenues changes were largely due to changes in revenues from sales in the wholesale energy market operated by miso  which began on april  these changes in revenues were largely offset by changes in electric production fuel and purchased power expense and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric margins

liquidity and capital resources overview alliant energy believes it has  and expects to maintain  a strong liquidity position as a result of available capacity under its revolving credit facilities  operating cash flows from its utility business and available cash and cash equivalents 
based on its strong liquidity position and capital structure  alliant energy believes it will be able to secure additional capital required to implement its strategic plan and meet its long term contractual obligations 
access to capital markets to fund its future capital requirements is largely dependent on the credit quality of alliant energy and its subsidiaries and credit market developments 
liquidity position at dec 
  alliant energy and its subsidiaries had million of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities and million of cash and cash equivalents 
capital structure alliant energy plans to maintain consolidated debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade credit ratings to ensure access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s capital structures at dec 
 were as follows dollars in millions alliant energy consolidated ipl wpl common equity preferred equity long term debt incl 
current maturities short term debt in addition to capital structures  other important financial considerations used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios  flexibility for the utility generation plan  state regulations and debt imputed by rating agencies 
the most stringent imputations include a portion of the daec  kewaunee  riverside and rockgen ppas and the amount of ipl s accounts receivable sold 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for details of imputed debt adjustments approved by the pscw in wpl s retail rate case 
ipl and wpl intend to manage their respective capital structures in such a way that they do not compromise their ability to raise the necessary funding required to enable them to continue to provide utility services reliably and at a reasonable cost 
key considerations include maintaining access to the financial markets on the terms  in the amounts and within the timeframes required to fund alliant energy s strategic plan  retaining a prudent level of financial flexibility and maintaining ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
the capital structure is only one of a number of components that needs to be actively managed in order to achieve these objectives 
both ipl and wpl currently expect to maintain a capital structure in which total debt would not exceed to  and preferred stock would not exceed to  of total capital 
these targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent developments and their potential impact on ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
credit market developments financial markets have been under considerable strain recently  resulting in negative impacts on the availability and terms of credit available to certain businesses 
the recent downturn in the us housing market has adversely affected domestic consumer demand and the financial markets  particularly lending and underwriting institutions active in the mortgage and asset backed obligation markets 
financial market conditions are sensitive to the evolving economic outlook  as investors try to assess the implications of economic information for future earnings and asset values 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware of the potential implications these credit market developments might have on their ability to raise the external funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure plans 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl have taken several measures over the past several years to improve their financial strength including reducing debt  securing multi year committed revolving credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs and a committed source of alternative liquidity in the event the commercial paper market is disrupted  arranging an accounts receivable sales program for up to million at ipl as an alternative source of working capital financing  retaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund a portion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s current operating and capital requirements in the event of credit market disruptions  and extending ipl s and wpl s respective long term debt maturity profiles and avoiding undue concentrations of maturities over the next few years 
primary sources and uses of cash alliant energy s most significant source of cash is electric and gas sales to its utility customers 
cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return on rate base assets required to provide such services 
utility operating cash flows are expected to cover the majority of ipl s and wpl s maintenance capital expenditures and dividends paid to alliant energy s shareowners 
capital requirements needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures for utility rate base growth related to new generating facilities and environmental compliance programs  are expected to be financed primarily through external financings 
in order to maintain debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade ratings  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may periodically fund such capital requirements with additional debt and equity

alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s credit facility agreements each contain negative pledge provisions  which generally prohibit placing liens on any of the property of alliant energy or its subsidiaries with certain exceptions 
exceptions include among others  securing obligations of up to of the consolidated assets of the borrower  non recourse project financing and purchase money liens 
the credit agreements each contain provisions that require  during their term  any proceeds from asset sales  with certain exclusions  in excess of of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s respective consolidated assets to be used to reduce commitments under their respective facilities 
exclusions include  among others  certain sale and lease back transactions  and transmission and non regulated assets 
the credit agreements each contain customary events of default 
in addition  alliant energy s credit agreement contains a cross default provision that is triggered if a domestic majority owned subsidiary of alliant energy defaults on debt totaling million or more 
a default by a minority owned affiliate or a foreign subsidiary would not trigger a cross default event 
a default by alliant energy or resources would not trigger a cross default event for either ipl or wpl  nor would a default by either of ipl or wpl trigger a cross default event for the other 
if an event of default under any of the credit agreements occurs and is continuing  then the lenders may declare any outstanding obligations under the credit agreements immediately due and payable 
in addition  if any order for relief is entered under bankruptcy laws with respect to alliant energy  ipl or wpl  then any outstanding obligations under the respective credit agreements would be immediately due and payable 
a material adverse change representation is not required for borrowings under these credit agreements

ratings triggers the long term debt of alliant energy and its subsidiaries is not subject to any repayment requirements as a result of explicit credit rating downgrades or so called ratings triggers 
however  alliant energy and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements  including ppas  fuel contracts and corporate guarantees that are dependent on maintaining investment grade credit ratings 
in the event of a downgrade below investment grade level  alliant energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide credit support  such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount of the exposure  or may need to unwind the contract or pay the underlying obligation 
in the event of a downgrade below investment grade level  management believes alliant energy  ipl and wpl have sufficient liquidity to cover counterparty credit support or collateral requirements under the various agreements with ratings triggers 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic leases alliant energy utilizes off balance sheet synthetic operating leases that relate to the financing of its corporate headquarters and utility railcars 
synthetic leases provide favorable financing rates to alliant energy while allowing it to maintain operating control of its leased assets 
refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for future minimum lease payments and residual value guarantees associated with these synthetic leases 
special purpose entities alliant energy uses special purpose entities for its accounts receivable sale program whereby ipl uses proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to maintain flexibility in its capital structure  take advantage of favorable short term interest rates and finance a portion of its long term cash needs 
the sale of accounts receivable generates a significant amount of liquidity for ipl

environmental overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal  state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl address these environmental matters with pollution abatement programs  which are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors  including changes in environmental regulations  construction plans and compliance costs 
given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements  ipl and wpl have established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental compliance of their future anticipated operations 
as part of ipl s and wpl s integrated planning process  significant environmental projects are approved by alliant energy s board of directors 
alliant energy anticipates future expenditures for environmental compliance will be material and will require significant capital investments 
alliant energy anticipates that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from its customers 
the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
air quality the clean air act caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
as part of the basic framework under the caa  the us environmental protection agency epa is required to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs  which serve to protect public health and welfare 
these standards address six criteria pollutants  four of which are particularly relevant to alliant energy s electric utility operations  including nitrogen oxides nox  so  particulate matter pm  and ozone 
ozone is not directly emitted from alliant energy s generating facilities  however  nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere 
state implementation plans sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs and related caa requirements 
the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules  then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan fip 
areas that comply with naaqs are considered to be in attainment  whereas routinely monitored locations that do not comply with these standards may be classified by the epa as non attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions 
additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond the naaqs 
the specific federal and state regulations that may affect alliant energy s operations include clean air interstate rule cair  wisconsin reasonably available control technology ract rule  clean air mercury rule camr  wisconsin state mercury rule  clean air visibility rule cavr  and industrial boiler maximum achievable control technology mact standards 
alliant energy also monitors various other potential environmental matters related to air quality  including litigation of various federal rules issued under the caa statutory authority  revisions to the new source review prevention of significant deterioration permitting programs and new source performance standards  federal proposals to further strengthen the naaqs for pm and ozone  and proposed legislation or other regulatory actions intended to reduce ghg emissions 
compliance costs ipl and wpl complete periodic evaluations of compliance costs for air quality rules 
these evaluations were most recently updated in based on information available regarding cair and camr sips and the costs and performance of control options 
furthermore  wpl s updated multi emissions compliance plan includes actions to address anticipated rule outcomes related to ract  best available retrofit technology bart and regional haze as discussed in paragraphs below 
the updated multi emissions compliance plans for ipl and wpl include investments in air pollution controls for their respective electric generating facilities as well as purchases of emission allowances 
ipl s and wpl s current estimated capital expenditures required to implement their updated multi emissions compliance plans are as follows in millions ipl wpl alliant energy these expenditure estimates represent ipl s or wpl s respective portion of the total escalated capital expenditures and exclude afudc  if applicable 
resources capital expenditures are not expected to be significant at its two wisconsin natural gas fired generating facilities that will be subject to cair compliance requirements 
capital expenditure estimates are subject to change based on future changes to plant specific costs of air pollution control technologies  outcomes of sips for current air rules and any additional requirements based on new air rules 
in addition  the selection and timing of installation of air pollution controls for compliance may change as a result of these and other considerations 
in the second quarter of  wpl filed a construction application with the pscw to install air pollution controls to reduce so emissions at the two existing units at nelson dewey 
capital expenditures for the nelson dewey so air pollution controls are estimated to be million and are included in the above estimates for alliant energy s and wpl s multi emissions compliance plans 
clean air interstate rule cair in  the epa issued cair  which requires reductions of so and nox emissions from existing and new electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity 
cair is a cap and trade market based program that is expected to reduce the regional transport of electric utility emissions to non attainment areas in the eastern us electric generating units covered by cair will receive authorizations to emit so and nox in the form of allowances  with the total amount available for actual emissions limited by the cap 
individual control requirements are not specified under a cap and trade program  but each company can design its own compliance strategy to meet the overall reduction requirement through installation of air pollution controls or purchase of allowances 
there is a two phase compliance schedule for cair 
the phase i compliance deadline is jan 
 for nox and jan 
 for so the phase compliance deadline is jan 
 for both nox and so when fully implemented  cair is expected to result in overall so and nox emissions reductions by over and from levels  respectively 
affected states under cair include iowa  wisconsin and minnesota 
epa has issued final sip approvals for the cair regulations adopted in iowa and wisconsin 
minnesota has not adopted state cair rules  and will participate directly in the epa program under the cair fip 
while alliant energy expects to comply through a combination of additional capital investments in emissions controls at various facilities and purchases of emissions allowances  it is continuing to review these alternatives 
wisconsin reasonably available control technology ract rule in  the epa designated counties in southeastern wisconsin as non attainment areas for the ozone naaqs 
this designation includes sheboygan county  where wpl operates sfef and the edgewater generating facility edgewater 
in the second quarter of  the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr approved the ract rule for nox as part of the federal ozone sip submittal to address non attainment areas in wisconsin 
modifications are not necessary at sfef to comply with this rule 
alliant energy expects that ract compliance at edgewater will result in accelerating nox emission reductions beyond the cair requirements through installation of emission controls earlier than required to meet cair requirements 
wpl is evaluating the ract rules to develop an approach to meet the and compliance deadlines at edgewater 
however  final compliance requirements cannot be certain until final epa approval of the ract rule has been received  which is currently expected later in clean air mercury rule camr in  the epa issued camr  which would require reductions of mercury emissions from existing and new us coal fired electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity in a two phased approach 
the first phase of compliance was required by jan 
 and the second phase by jan 
 similar to the cair program  camr would use a national cap and trade system  where compliance may be achieved by either adding mercury controls and or purchasing allowances 
in february  a court decision vacated and remanded camr to the epa for reconsideration 
the epa s response to this court decision and associated implications to ipl and wpl are uncertain at this time 
there are also uncertainties regarding the applicability of state regulations that would implement the epa rules and state responses in the interim until the epa issues revised rules 
ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from the reconsidered rule could be significant 
furthermore  estimated compliance costs for camr currently included in compliance costs will be reviewed and may be revised when additional information becomes available regarding the epa s rule reconsideration 
wisconsin state mercury rule in  the wisconsin dnr independently issued a state only mercury emission control rule that affects electric utility companies in wisconsin 
the rule explicitly recognizes an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal mercury program unless there is a demonstration that more stringent requirements are necessary to provide adequate protection for public health or welfare 
the rule states that the wisconsin dnr must adopt state rule changes within months of publication of any federal rules 
however  the wisconsin camr regulation has not yet been adopted 
the wisconsin mercury rule includes a requirement to cap mercury emissions beginning on jan 
 wpl believes its current multi emissions compliance plan includes sufficient controls to meet this cap 
further impacts remain uncertain until the epa responds to the court decision to vacate and remand the federal camr 
clean air visibility rule cavr the epa issued cavr in to address regional haze 
cavr requires states to develop and implement sips to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country with a national goal of no impairment by affected states  including iowa  wisconsin and minnesota  were required to submit a sip to the epa by december to include bart air pollution controls and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze 
the implementation of cavr sip reductions are scheduled to begin to take effect in with full implementation before generating facility emissions of primary concern for bart and regional haze regulation include so  nox and pm 
under cavr  states participating in cair s cap and trade program can determine that cair has precedence over bart 
therefore  bart requirements will be deemed to be met through compliance with cair requirements 
in addition to bart  individual states are required to identify additional regional haze control measures needed to address visibility protection at designated areas 
iowa dnr has issued a proposed cavr sip that recommends no additional bart or regional haze controls for electric generating facilities beyond cair 
wisconsin dnr submission of a sip remains outstanding 
the wisconsin natural resources board has adopted a wisconsin bart regulation that will accept cair controls for generating facilities  although legislative review is pending as a component of the cavr sip 
in addition  wisconsin dnr will complete a subsequent assessment of the need for supplemental regional haze regulations 
ipl generating facilities operated in minnesota do not combust coal and therefore additional emissions controls were deemed unnecessary in the proposed minnesota cavr sip 
alliant energy is unable to predict the impact that cavr might have on the operations of its existing coal fired generating facilities until iowa and wisconsin have received final epa approvals of cavr sip submittals  which is currently expected in late industrial boiler maximum achievable control technology mact rule in  the epa s industrial boiler mact rule became effective  and compliance with these new emission requirements for hazardous air pollutants was required by september this rule applies to fossil fuel generating units with less than mw of capacity 
in  alliant energy submitted initial notifications to the epa and iowa dnr identifying specific generating units that may require compliance with the industrial boiler mact rule and subsequently received concurrence that two of ipl s coal fired units are subject to the requirements 
alliant energy and ipl expect that compliance with the industrial boiler mact rules for the two units can be met with existing emission control equipment  periodic fuel monitoring and good combustion operational practices 
in june  a court decision vacated and remanded this rule to the epa for further consideration 
epa will be revising the industrial boiler mact rule in response to this court decision and the implications to ipl s and wpl s electric generating facilities are uncertain at this time 
third party excess emission claims alliant energy is aware that certain citizen groups have begun pursuing claims against owners of utility generating facilities regarding excess emissions  including opacity emissions 
while ipl and wpl have not received any such claims to date  wpl is aware that certain public comments have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr regarding excess emission reports for two of wpl s generating facilities 
wpl is unable to predict what actions  if any  the wisconsin dnr or the public commenters may take in response to these public comments 
alliant energy continues to monitor its emissions closely to determine whether additional controls will be required 
the anticipated additional capital investments for cair and camr compliance discussed above are expected to contribute to improvements in opacity emissions 
however  should more stringent opacity limits be required  the timing of investments and control equipment options to comply with these multiple regulatory requirements will need further evaluation 
third party alleged air permitting violation claims there have been instances where citizen groups have pursued claims against utilities for alleged air permitting violations 
while ipl and wpl have not received any such claims to date  both utilities are aware of certain public comments that have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr and iowa dnr regarding the renewal of air operating permits 
wpl has learned from discussions with the wisconsin dnr that one of wpl s generating facilities will need to lower its opacity and pm emissions as part of its air operating permit renewal process 
wpl is developing a compliance schedule to submit to the wisconsin dnr that will detail how this will be done in a timely manner 
wpl is also aware that a citizen group has filed a petition with the wisconsin dnr regarding modification of an air operating permit for another wpl generating facility 
wpl and ipl are unable to predict what actions  if any  the wisconsin dnr  iowa dnr  or the public commenters may take in response to any public comments and petitions 
greenhouse gases ghg emissions public awareness of climate change continues to grow along with support for policymakers to take action to mitigate global warming 
there is considerable debate regarding the public policy response that the us should adopt  involving both domestic actions and international efforts 
several members of congress have proposed legislation to regulate ghg emissions  primarily targeting reductions of carbon dioxide co emissions 
state and regional initiatives to address ghg emissions are also underway in the states covering alliant energy s utility service territory 
specifically  governors from nine midwest states  including iowa  wisconsin and minnesota  signed the midwestern ghg accord in november the participants are expected to develop a proposed cap and trade agreement and a model rule within months of the date of this accord 
the accord also provides for an month implementation period following completion of the cap and trade agreement and model rule 
alliant energy continues to take voluntary measures to reduce its emissions including co and other ghg as prudent steps to address potential climate change regulation 
strategically  alliant energy focuses on the following areas to reduce ghg installation of commercially proven controls for air emissions and continued operational excellence to achieve further generating facility efficiency improvements  demand side management including energy conservation programs  expansion of company owned renewable energy sources  continued use of ppas and investments that focus on lower or non emitting generation resources  and development of technology solutions through funding of collaborative research programs for advanced clean coal generation as well as potential options for carbon sequestration 
alliant energy s board of directors has assigned oversight of environmental policy and planning issues  including climate change  to the environmental  nuclear  health and safety enhs committee 
the enhs committee is comprised solely of independent directors 
the enhs committee reports on its reviews and  as appropriate  makes recommendations to alliant energy s board of directors 
given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future regulations regarding the control of ghg emissions and the lack of established technology that will significantly reduce ghg emissions  alliant energy currently cannot predict the financial impact of any future climate change regulations on its operations but the capital expenditures to comply with any new emissions controls could be significant 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for discussion of the midwestern ghg accord and a state energy related law sf enacted in may which creates a ghg emissions control plan for minnesota 
chicago climate exchange in the third quarter of  alliant energy issued a letter of commitment for ipl  wpl and resources to participate in the chicago climate exchange ccx for the phase i membership period covering through ccx members voluntarily agree to a co emissions baseline level and subsequent annual co emission reduction targets from this baseline level during the membership period covered with their commitment to the ccx 
if members reduce their co emissions by less than the reduction targets  they must buy allowances from other ccx members to cover their shortfall 
on the other hand  if members reduce their co emissions by more than the reduction targets  they may sell their excess allowances to other ccx members or carry forward their excess allowances for use in future periods 
allowance sales and purchases occur at a market price determined by ccx members through their participation in the market administered by ccx 
alliant energy anticipates completion of the formal application process for participation in the phase i period of ccx in the first quarter of alliant energy does not anticipate any material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations as a result of participating in the ccx for the phase i period 
water quality federal clean water act the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
in  the second phase of this epa rule became effective and is generally referred to as b 
b applies to existing cooling water intake structures at large steam electric generating facilities 
ipl and wpl have identified seven and three generating facilities  respectively  which they believe are impacted by b and are currently preparing evaluations of the potential impacts of the rule 
in january  a court decision on this rule remanded some aspects of the rule to the epa for further consideration 
it is unclear whether the epa will stay the deadlines in the rule until the remanded rulemaking is finished 
as a result  b s compliance requirements and associated deadlines are currently unknown 
ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome  however expect that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this regulation could be significant 
wisconsin state thermal rule wpl is currently evaluating proposed revisions to the wisconsin administrative code concerning the amount of heat that wpl s generating facilities can discharge into wisconsin waters 
hearings on proposed revisions to thermal water quality rules were held during january and a final rule is not expected to be completed until late at this time  wpl is unable to predict the final outcome of the proposed rules  but believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this regulation could be significant 
hydroelectric fish passages and fish protective devices in  ferc issued an order requiring wpl to take the following actions regarding one of wpl s hydroelectric generating facilities develop a detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages for the facility  install an agency approved fish protective device at the facility within one year and install an agency approved fish passage at the facility within three years 
in  wpl filed an extension request with ferc for the detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages and installation of an agency approved fish protective device 
in  ferc approved extending the evaluation and installation for the downstream fish passage to april and upstream fish passage to april in january  the us fish and wildlife service and wisconsin dnr requested additional changes and further analysis on the fish passage design  delaying the construction plan 
once wpl receives these agencies approvals  wpl will file a new construction plan with ferc 
the fish protection equipment construction and installation plans were approved by the us fish and wildlife service and wisconsin dnr in december ferc approval is pending 
wpl believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this issue could be significant 
land and solid waste manufactured gas plant mgp sites ipl and wpl have current or previous ownership interests in and mgp sites  respectively  previously associated with the production of gas for which they may be liable for investigation  remediation and monitoring costs relating to the sites 
ipl and wpl are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate  mitigate  prevent and remediate  where necessary  the environmental impacts to property  including natural resources  at and around the sites in order to protect public health and the environment 
refer to note e of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for estimates of the range of remaining costs to be incurred for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of ipl s and wpl s mgp sites 
missouri electric works legal action in  ipl was served with a lawsuit filed by the epa against named defendants to recover costs incurred for investigation and remediation of the missouri electric works  inc mew site in cape girardeau  missouri 
ipl had previously been served a complaint in  filed by the mew site trust fund  the potentially responsible party group involved 
in may  in deciding ipl s motion for summary judgment  the court agreed with ipl s long standing position that ipl is not a liable party at the mew superfund site 
it is possible that the epa will appeal this ruling to the court of appeals after the court s ruling on all case matters becomes final 
ash landfill sites in  ipl received notification from the iowa dnr regarding groundwater monitoring of four of its closed ash landfills and the need to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills 
the iowa dnr approved ipl s plans to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at these two landfills  which were implemented beginning april work was completed at one of the landfills in june and work is currently pending at the other landfill due to delays with obtaining access agreements from neighboring property owners 
the iowa dnr is aware of the access agreement delays and may intercede with the property owners if necessary 
ipl provides periodic updates on the status of implementing the monitoring plan to the iowa dnr 
monitoring results will be used to determine if further measures are required and ipl is currently unable to predict the outcome 
land and solid waste regulatory issues alliant energy is also monitoring various other land and solid waste regulatory changes 
this includes a potential epa regulation for management of coal combustion product in landfills and surface impoundments that could require installation of monitoring wells at some facilities and an ongoing expanded groundwater monitoring program 
compliance with the polychlorinated biphenyls pcb fix it rule persistent organic pollutants treaty could possibly require replacement of all electrical equipment containing pcb insulating fluid which is a substance known to be harmful to human health 
the wisconsin department of commerce has drafted a new rule related to flammable  combustible and hazardous liquids stored in above ground storage tanks 
this draft rule has not yet been finalized 
the primary financial impact of this new rule would be from a secondary containment requirement for all new hazardous materials tanks and for new hazardous material unloading areas 
alliant energy is unable to predict the outcome of these possible regulatory changes at this time  but currently believes that the required capital investment and or modifications resulting from these potential regulations could be significant 
refer to note e of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements  business and construction and acquisition expenditures for further discussion of environmental matters 
other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  interest rates and equity prices 
alliant energy has risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and uses derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to notes l and of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s derivative instruments 
commodity price risk alliant energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electric  coal and natural gas products it procures and markets 
alliant energy employs established policies and procedures to mitigate its risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is also significantly mitigated by the current rate making structures in place for recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs fuel related costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s retail and wholesale electric tariffs and retail gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric tariffs and retail gas tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in commodity costs thereby significantly mitigating any price risk for prudently incurred commodity costs 
ipl s and wpl s rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives discussed above  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with ipl s retail and wholesale electric and retail gas margins and wpl s wholesale electric and retail gas margins 
however  wpl s retail electric margins are more exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanisms in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
wpl s retail electric rates are based on forecasts of forward looking test year periods and include estimates of future fuel related costs per mwh anticipated during the test periods 
during each electric retail rate proceeding for wpl  the pscw sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel related costs per mwh used to determine rates 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test period  wpl can request and the pscw can authorize an adjustment to future retail electric rates 
as part of this process  the pscw may authorize an interim fuel related rate increase or decrease until final rates are determined 
however  if an interim rate increase is granted and the final rate increase is less than the interim rate increase  wpl would refund the excess collection to customers  including interest  at the current authorized return on equity rate 
as part of wpl s january retail rate case decision  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs per mwh of based on million of variable fuel costs for wpl s test period and set annual fuel monitoring ranges of plus or minus 
based on the current retail recovery mechanism  alliant energy and wpl have exposure to wpl s retail electric margins from increases in fuel related costs above the forecasted fuel related costs per mwh used to determine electric rates to the extent such increases are not recovered through prospective fuel only retail rate changes 
alliant energy and wpl have additional commodity price risk resulting from the lag inherent in obtaining any approved retail rate relief for potential increases in fuel related costs above the fuel monitoring ranges and the prospective nature of any retail rate relief which precludes wpl from recovering under recovered costs from ratepayers in the future 
refer to rates and regulatory matters utility fuel cost recovery for additional details of the retail rate recovery mechanism in wisconsin for electric fuel related costs 
alliant energy and wpl are unable to determine the anticipated impact of changes in commodity prices on their future electric margins given the uncertainty of how future fuel related costs will correlate with the retail electric rates in place and the outcome of the proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
interest rate risk alliant energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable rate debt  ipl s accounts receivable sale program and variable rate leasing agreements 
alliant energy manages this interest rate risk by limiting its variable interest rate exposure 
assuming no change in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average basis points higher lower in than in  expense would increase decrease by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in interest rates on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated variable rate debt held  the amount outstanding under ipl s accounts receivable sale program and variable rate lease balances at dec 
 equity price risk alliant energy is exposed to equity price risk as a result of its investments in debt and equity securities  including securities held by its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
refer to critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits for the impact on alliant energy s pension and other postretirement benefits costs of changes in the rate of returns earned by its plan assets  which include equity securities 
new accounting pronouncements refer to note u of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of new accounting pronouncements impacting alliant energy 
critical accounting policies based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business and the understanding of its results of operations as they require critical estimates be made based on the assumptions and judgment of management 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make various estimates and assumptions that affect revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies 
the results of these estimates and judgments form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 
alliant energy s management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of alliant energy s accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
regulatory assets and liabilities alliant energy s utility subsidiaries ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  they qualify for the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between accounting principles generally accepted in the us and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
ipl and wpl recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and liabilities 
alliant energy periodically assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the nature and amounts of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and liabilities 
asset valuations of long lived assets to be held and used alliant energy s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets  which are not subject to recovery under sfas and are reflected in non regulated and other property  plant and equipment 
as a result  alliant energy must generate future cash flows from such assets in a non regulated environment to ensure the carrying value is not impaired 
alliant energy assesses the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors alliant energy considers in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in alliant energy s use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when alliant energy determines an impairment review is necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
resources owns the mw  simple cycle  natural gas fired nef in neenah  wisconsin 
the entire power output of nef is currently sold under contract to milwaukee  wisconsin based we energies through may in april  wpl filed for approval from the pscw to purchase nef 
wpl plans to file for approval from ferc for the purchase of nef in the first half of after receipt of pscw approval 
wpl currently plans to acquire nef effective june   which coincides with the expected termination of wpl s rockgen ppa scheduled for may resources entered into a contract to sell nef s capacity for the interim time period from june  to may  alliant energy has assessed the recoverability of the carrying cost of the long lived assets of nef by estimating the future anticipated undiscounted cash flows and the probability of each strategic alternative 
the future anticipated cash flows and probabilities of each strategic alternative are significant estimates 
a change in these estimates could result in a material asset valuation charge in the future 
at dec 
  the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with nef was million

unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various estimates  thus significant changes in the estimates could have a material impact on alliant energy s results of operations 
at dec 
 and  unbilled revenues associated with alliant energy s utility operations were million million at ipl and million at wpl and million million at ipl and million at wpl  respectively 
refer to alliant energy s results of operations utility electric margins unbilled revenue estimates for discussion of annual adjustments to unbilled electric revenue estimates in the second quarters of  and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits alliant energy sponsors various pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide benefits to a significant portion of the employees of ipl  wpl and corporate services 
alliant energy accounts for these pensions and other postretirement benefits under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates 
there are many factors involved in determining an entity s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including assumptions regarding employee demographics including age  life expectancies  and compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefits costs 
alliant energy s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually 
as of sep 
 alliant energy s most recent measurement date  future assumptions included a discount rate to calculate benefit obligations and a annual expected rate of return on investments 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  alliant energy reviews various corporate aa bond indices 
the annual expected rate of return is consistent with the historical returns of alliant energy s plan assets and is based on projected long term equity and bond returns  maturities and asset allocations

income taxes alliant energy accounts for income taxes under fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates used to determine an entity s income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expenses each period 
these assumptions include projections of alliant energy s future taxable income used to determine its ability to utilize loss carryovers prior to their expiration and impacts from the completion of audits of the tax treatment of certain transactions 
alliant energy s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed quarterly by management 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s financial condition and results of operations 
capital loss utilization as of dec 
  alliant energy estimated that it will be able to generate sufficient capital gains in the future to offset all of its current federal and iowa capital loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
if alliant energy is unable to generate sufficient iowa capital gains prior to the expiration of its current capital loss carryforwards  there could be a material impact to its financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a change in management s estimates and assumptions related to the amounts and timing of capital gains and losses could have a material impact on alliant energy s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such change occurs 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding unrecognized tax benefits for alliant energy  ipl and wpl and note g of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of a tax contingency related to capital losses from alliant energy s former brazil investments 
other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in mda  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item and in risk factors in item a  the following items could impact alliant energy s future financial condition or results of operations ipl s electric transmission assets sale in december  ipl completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in iowa  minnesota and illinois to itc for net proceeds of million  subject to post closing adjustments 
subsequent to the closing of the sale  ipl began incurring charges from itc for transmission services required to serve its electric customers 
these charges for transmission services from itc are recorded in operation and maintenance expenses on alliant energy s and ipl s consolidated statements of income and are currently expected to be between million to million in the negative impact on alliant energy s and ipl s earnings from these charges for transmission services in will be partially offset by the elimination of depreciation  other operation and maintenance and property tax expenses related to the electric transmission assets that were sold and the positive impacts on interest income and interest expense from the use of the proceeds from the sale to fund investments in short term securities and reduce short term debt 
alliant energy currently estimates the net impact of these items will reduce its earnings in as compared to by approximately per share per share decrease in earnings at ipl partially offset by a per share increase in earnings at alliant energy parent company 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the sale 
incentive compensation plans alliant energy s total compensation program includes an incentive compensation program icp which provides substantially all of its non bargaining employees and certain bargaining unit employees an opportunity to receive annual short term incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual corporate goals including  among others  earnings per share from continuing operations and cash flows from operations 
funding of the icp is designed so that alliant energy retains all earnings up to a pre established earnings target 
after achieving such target  there is a sharing mechanism of earnings between alliant energy and employees up to an established maximum funding amount for the icp 
in addition  the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long term incentive awards issued under an equity incentive plan eip 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of outstanding awards issued under alliant energy s eip 
alliant energy is currently unable to determine what impacts these incentive compensation plans will have on its future financial condition or results of operations 
ethanol and biodiesel production ethanol and biodiesel production in the us experienced significant growth since largely due to a mandate for ethanol usage in the energy policy act of and the promotion of e  a blend of ethanol and gasoline  used to fuel vehicles 
ethanol production facilities in the us are concentrated in the corn growing regions in the midwest given corn is the primary raw material used to produce ethanol 
electricity demand from new ethanol and biodiesel production facilities located in alliant energy s utility service territory has resulted in an increase in alliant energy s electric sales volumes 
currently there are eight ethanol and two biodiesel plants that are under construction within alliant energy s service territory 
once completed  these plants may add another mw of electricity demand to alliant energy s existing demand from ethanol and biodiesel plants of approximately mw 
a number of previously announced plants in alliant energy s service territory have not begun construction  which is reflective of a nationwide slowdown in the construction of ethanol production facilities 
this slowdown has been caused by a number of factors including changes in the price of ethanol  an increase in the cost of corn  tighter access to financing and escalation of construction costs to build the production facilities 
alliant energy is currently unable to estimate the impacts new ethanol and biodiesel production facilities in its service territory will have on its future financial condition or results of operations 
ipl s electric sales projections archer daniel midland  owner of wet corn milling plants in iowa and an industrial customer of ipl  is currently constructing two mw cogeneration facilities in clinton  iowa to meet its own electric demand 
these cogeneration facilities are currently expected to result in a reduction in ipl s electric demand and have a negative impact on alliant energy s and ipl s electric margins beginning as early as the fourth quarter of wpl depreciation study in february  the pscw issued an order approving the implementation of updated depreciation rates for wpl effective july  as a result of a recently completed depreciation study 
the updated depreciation rates are lower than wpl s current depreciation rates 
wpl currently expects its annual depreciation expense will decrease approximately million compared to its annual depreciation expense amounts as a result of the implementation of the updated depreciation rates 
the impacts of this depreciation study will be considered in wpl s future rate proceedings 
due to uncertainties such as when  and to what extent  the new depreciation estimates from the study will be reflected in its future rates  wpl is unable to determine the future impacts on its financial condition or results of operations 
enterprise resource planning erp software alliant energy uses an erp software system to record  process and report human resources  finance and supply chain transactions 
the initial implementation costs for the erp software were fully amortized as of aug 
 as a result  alliant energy currently expects its annual amortization expense amount will be approximately million lower than its annual amortization expense amount 
miso wholesale energy market miso is currently developing an ancillary services market  which includes systems and business processes  to complement the existing wholesale energy market that miso implemented in april the ancillary services market is currently projected to begin operation in june in september  miso filed an amended tariff with ferc and plans to secure approval of the tariff in time to meet the planned implementation 
alliant energy continues to prepare for the start of the ancillary services market 
alliant energy is monitoring the development of the market to ensure that the rules associated with the market are reasonable and that costs and revenues associated with the market receive appropriate regulatory cost recovery treatment 
alliant energy is currently unable to determine what impacts this new market will have on its future financial condition or results of operations
