introduction and overview our business model is based primarily upon the design  production and sale of software that supports the wireless industry 
our products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world that support data communications through the use of mobile devices or other wireless communication devices such as pc cards  usb modems  and embedded modems 
wireless network providers generally incorporate our products into their accessory products sold directly to individual consumers or on servers in the network environment to facilitate firmware over the air updating for mobile devices 
our business is primarily dependent upon the demand for wireless communications and content management solutions and the corresponding requirements for software solutions to support this demand 
during the last three years  demand for these types of products has increased as wireless providers race to introduce higher network speeds  and launch new services that utilize these improving wireless broadband networks 
we continue to invest in research and development for one of the industry s leading wireless product lines and we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on market opportunities as we leverage the strength of our technology capabilities with our growing global reach and expanding product lines 

during  we were focused on integrating three major acquisitions while organically growing our business 
as such  we saw a significant increase in revenues accompanied by an increase in operating expenses  including significant non cash expenses which include stock based compensation  amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions  and non cash tax expense 
we believe that there continues to be excellent growth opportunities within the wireless communications software marketplace and we continue to focus on positioning smith micro to benefit from these opportunities

we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources

we may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we currently report our net revenues under the following operating groups multimedia  connectivity security  consumer  mobile device management and other 
within each of these groups software revenue is recognized based on the customer and contract type 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements of sop are met 
if the requirements of sop are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
within the consumer group certain revenues are booked net of revenue sharing payments  pursuant to the consensus of eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we have a few multiple elements agreement for which we have contracted to provide a perpetual license for use of proprietary software  to provide non recurring engineering  and in some cases to provide software maintenance post contract support 
for multiple element agreements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all contract elements is reviewed and the timing of the individual element revenue streams is determined and recognized consistent with sop sales directly to end users are recognized upon delivery 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 

table of contents accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain a bad debt reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and no impairment was identified 
as a result of the adoption  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was amortized over years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
at december   we elected to write off all goodwill associated with our services sector  or  the consulting portion of our services sector has been de emphasized and is no longer considered a strategic element of our go forward plan 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill as related to the products sector at december  estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units change  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of  we had a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
based on our assessment of all available evidence  we concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully realized in the future 
this conclusion is based primarily on our improving financial performance and projected income in the future years 
as a result  we released all of our valuation allowance in the release of the valuation allowance decreased our tax expense in in addition  effective january   the company adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
based on our evaluation  we have concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our financial statements

table of contents contractual interest or principle cash flows 
sfas also amends sfas no 
to allow qualifying special purpose entities to hold a passive derivative financial instrument pertaining to beneficial interests that itself is a derivative instrument 
we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard but believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas  which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations  requires that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits an entity to choose either the amortization method or the fair value method for subsequent measurement for each class of separately recognized servicing assets or servicing liabilities  permits at initial adoption a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized servicing rights  provided the securities reclassified offset the entity s exposure to changes in the fair value of the servicing assets or liabilities  and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
the statement also describes the manner in which it should be initially applied 
accordingly  we have adopted sfas effective january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
on january   the fasb affirmed its previous decision to make fin effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  we have adopted fin effective january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operation and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines the fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is encouraged  provided that we have not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact sfas may have on our results of operations and financial position 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements 
the task force concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to eitf are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  the first quarter of our fiscal year 
the application of eitf has not had a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
subsequent changes in fair value for designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in the current period 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for similar types of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance  which directly depends on the nature and extent of eligible items elected to be measured at fair value  upon initial application of the standard on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
the objective of sfas r is to improve reporting by creating greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations  resulting in more complete  comparable and relevant information for investors and other users of financial statements 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas r includes both core principles and pertinent application guidance  eliminating the need for numerous eitf issues and other interpretative guidance  thereby reducing the complexity of existing gaap 
sfas r is effective as of the start of fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is not allowed 
we are in the process of evaluating this standard and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas improves the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report non controlling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  sfas eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and non controlling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas is effective as of the start of fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is not allowed 
we are in the process of evaluating this standard and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
while we now have branches in south korea  sweden  and norway  as a company most of our business is conducted in us dollars 
as such  we do not have any significant translation or transaction currency exposures at december
