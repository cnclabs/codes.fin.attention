these economic trends  in turn  can be influenced by the areas larger employers and industries  such as mississippi state university and columbus air force base in mississippi  university of alabama and mercedes benz automotive plant in alabama  federal express and auto zone in tennessee  and the tourism industry in florida 
there were no outstanding foreign loans at december  loans classified for regulatory purposes or for internal credit review purposes that have not been disclosed in the table above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management expects will materially impact the financial condition of the corporation or its subsidiary bank  or their future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
if all nonaccrual loans had been current throughout their terms  interest income would have not been significantly different for the year ended december  management stringently monitors loans that are classified as non performing 
non performing loans include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  and loans renegotiated or restructured because of a debtor s financial difficulties 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status if any of the following events occur a the classification of a loan as non accrual internally or by regulatory examiners  b delinquency on principal for days or more unless management is in the process of collection  c a balance remains after repossession of collateral  d notification of bankruptcy  or e management judges that non accrual status is appropriate

determination of allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans  as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining portfolio 
reference should be made to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements and to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following schedule sets forth the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any category

graded loans are those loans that exhibit some form of weakness 
allocations to this group are based upon the historical loan loss experience of the grades assigned and upon specific allocations to specific loans 
an allowance is allocated to the various pools of loans considered to be homogenous based upon the historical loan losses of each pool 
the types of homogeneous pools included in our evaluation of the allowance for loan losses are lease financing loans  mortgage loans  personal loans  home equity lines  student loans  and personal credit lines 
other loans consist of those loans not graded or impaired or considered homogenous 
these loans are grouped by risk assignments  which are based upon consideration of collateral values  borrower financial condition and performance  debt service capacity  cash flows  market share and other indicators 
allocations of the allowance to these loans are based upon historical loan loss experience of the risk assignment 
c 
loans and risk descriptions real estate loans the bank originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled billion or approximately of the loan portfolio 
the bank originates commercial real estate loans of up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the corporation s policy to originate these loans only to carefully selected borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending are the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in 
table of contents commercial real estate lending  cadence has historically sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
the bank originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in its lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these loans 
loans for multi family or more units residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income generating properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans cadence offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million  or of total loans  at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers 
in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
cadence intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
the bank makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms generally not exceeding five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations the following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of cadence financial corporation the corporation 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the supplemental financial data included elsewhere in this report 
for purposes of the following discussion  the words the corporation  we  us and our refer to the combined entities of cadence financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  cadence bank  na cadence or the bank  unless the context suggests otherwise 
introduction and management overview the corporation is a financial holding company that owns cadence 
cadence operates in the states of mississippi  alabama  tennessee  florida and georgia 
cadence s primary business is providing traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers 
cadence also provides other financial services  including trust services  mortgage services  insurance and investment products 
our stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the ticker symbol of cade 

table of contents cadence s profitability  like that of many financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and noninterest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income cadence receives on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense cadence pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
noninterest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  trust  investment activities  mortgage origination and servicing  insurance and other customer services which cadence provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including taxes 
economic conditions  competition and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government in general  significantly affect financial institutions  including cadence 
lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by the level of business spending and investment  consumer income  spending and savings  capital market activities  competition among financial institutions  customer preferences  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in cadence s market areas 
during  five major factors significantly impacted our operating results  as follows million impairment loss relating to our first quarter rescission of the application of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
to certain investment securities  resulting in a per share after tax impact on our earnings in million increase in provision for loan losses due to softening in certain real estate sectors and the economy in general  as well as a deterioration of certain large credits 
loan growth in our tennessee  alabama and florida markets positively impacted our net interest income 
however  the general softening in the economy caused our loan growth to be approximately less than budgeted 
one hundred basis point rate reduction by the federal reserve in this rate reduction impacted our yields on earning assets and cost of funds 
strong competition for core deposits  resulting in the cost of retail deposits exceeding the cost of wholesale deposits 
this competition negatively impacted our margin and resulted in increased utilization of the wholesale market to fund our growth 
for  our net interest margin was  compared to for we were able to increase our loan yields by basis points between and  however  our net interest margin was negatively impacted by the increase in our overall cost of funds of basis points during this same period 
pricing for deposits did not decline at the same pace as variable rate assets because of the strong competition for these funds 
the cost of deposits increased by basis points from to our margins were under significantly more pressure in the fourth quarter of due to the basis point rate reduction  as our variable rate loans immediately repriced but deposit costs continued to remain high 
our provision for loan losses was substantially higher in as compared to  due primarily to the deterioration of some large credits  a softening in certain real estate sectors  and a general softening in the economy 
we do not engage in any sub prime or alt a lending  therefore  none of the increase in our provision for loan losses related to or was affected by these types of loans 
our underwriting standards for certain segments have tightened based on recent changes in market conditions  and we believe that the current level of our allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  during  noninterest income  including gains on securities and impairment loss on securities  decreased from million to million 
noninterest income for reflects an impairment loss on certain investment securities that related to our decision to rescind the application of fasb statement no 
to these securities 
the components of and other reasons for the decrease in this category are discussed more fully below 
noninterest income accounted for of income in  of income in and of income in the changes in these percentages were impacted more by the growth in total interest income than by the changes in noninterest income 
the growth of noninterest income continues to be an important part of our strategic goals 
one of our goals in was to continue to control the level of noninterest expenses 
during  total noninterest expenses increased by million  or  as compared to the year ended december  virtually all of this increase in is due to a full year of expenses relating to new branches in brentwood and memphis  tennessee opened in  a full year of expenses relating to the branches acquired in connection with the suncoast bancorp  inc suncoast and 
table of contents seasons bancshares  inc seasons acquisitions in  and expenses relating to new branches in the cities of hoover  alabama and franklin  tennessee opened in for  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for diluted weighted average shares outstanding were higher due to the stock offering and suncoast acquisition in  from million in to million in also  our net income for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by per share after tax due to the rescission of the application of fasb statement no 
to certain investment securities 
this rescission resulted in an impairment loss on those securities 
we are continuing our efforts to grow loans and improve our margin 
while loan growth is expected to slow in as compared to  we believe that  based on the current state of the economy  we will still be able to achieve solid growth  primarily in our tennessee and alabama markets 
the expansion or even maintenance of the margin  however  will be a more difficult objective to attain in the current interest rate environment 
with the recent rate reductions by the federal reserve basis points in and basis points in january  our variable rate loans are repricing downward 
however  the need for core deposits makes it very difficult to reduce the cost of these funds 
there is strong competition for core deposits as all banks struggle to maintain this very important component of their funding 
additionally  our need for funding has increased as our loan demand has increased  requiring us to pay higher rates to grow deposits 
currently  we expect that interest rates will continue to decline at least through the first half of we expect growth to continue in our tennessee  alabama and florida markets  however  we expect this growth to occur more slowly in we based our projections  budgets and goals on these expectations 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  they could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of our operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and the provision for loan losses 
we continue to look for ways to grow noninterest income 
the continued growth in the memphis market  the expansion into the birmingham and nashville areas and our acquisitions of suncoast in florida and seasons in georgia have provided new customer bases for our other banking products and services 
we will also continue our efforts to control noninterest expenses by working to achieve maximum efficiencies within our new expanded footprint 
reducing our efficiency ratio remains a key objective 
the previously mentioned growth in assets  expansion of noninterest income  and control of noninterest expenses will all contribute to net income growth 
other areas of focus to accomplish this goal will be controlling the cost of funding that will be needed to support our earning assets and maintaining our level of credit quality 
funding is a challenging issue  due to the current rate environment 
this situation makes it very difficult to obtain the desired spread between loan yields and cost of funds 
if the economy continues to slow or the real estate market continues to soften  credit quality could become a more significant issue 
in management s opinion  the current level of the allowance for loan losses is sufficient for the level of anticipated losses in our current loan portfolio 
however  we have tightened our underwriting standards for certain segments based on recent changes in market conditions  in an effort to better control credit quality 
in summary  our primary objective in is to increase net income by improving our net interest margin  maintaining our credit quality  and controlling non interest expenses 
recently issued accounting standards and critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to united states generally accepted accounting principles and  where applicable  to general practices within the banking industry 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in this report  including this management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies it is management s opinion that the areas of the financial statements that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and therefore contain the most critical accounting estimates  are the provision for loan losses and the resulting allowance for loan losses  the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  issues relating to other than temporary impairment losses in the securities portfolio  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
provision allowance for loan losses our provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management after their evaluation of the risk exposure contained in our loan 
table of contents portfolio 
the senior credit officers and the loan review staff perform the methodology used to make this determination of risk exposure on a quarterly basis 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of our ability to collect the loans and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value securing such loans 
if the senior credit officers and loan review staff determine that impairments exist  specific portions of the allowance are allocated to these individual loans 
we group all other loans into homogeneous pools and determine risk exposure by considering the following non exclusive list of factors historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
additionally  management looks at specific external credit risk factors that bring additional risk into the portfolio 
for the year ended december   we identified the following external risk factors declining economic conditions  increased risk associated with commercial real estate credits  and the softening of real estate sectors in our markets 
these external risk factors are re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
management makes its estimates of the credit risk in the portfolio and the amount of provision needed to keep the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level using what management believes are the best and most current sources of information available at the time of the estimates  however  many of these factors can change quickly and with no advance warning 
if management significantly misses its estimates in any period  it can have a material impact on the results of operations for that period and for subsequent periods 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans another area that requires subjective and complex judgments is the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we maintain several benefit plans for our employees 
they include a defined benefit pension plan  a defined contribution pension plan  a k plan and a deferred compensation plan 
we make all contributions to these plans when due 
the defined benefit pension plan is the only plan that requires multiple assumptions to determine the liability under the plan 
this plan has been frozen to new participants for several years 
management evaluates  reviews with the plan actuaries  and updates as appropriate the assumptions used in the determination of pension liability  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on the plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future benefits that is recorded on the financial statements as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
in selecting the expected rate of return  management  in consultation with the plan trustees  selected a rate based on assumptions compared to recent returns and economic forecasts 
we consider the current allocation of the portfolio and the probable rates of return of each investment type 
in selecting the discount rate  prior to  management  in consultation with actuarial consultants  selected rates based on rates of return on long term  high quality bonds having maturity dates corresponding as closely as possible to the expected retirement dates of the employees and the subsequent payout periods of the respective plans 
beginning in  management  with the assistance of actuarial consultants  selects the appropriate discount rate by performing an analysis of the plan s projected benefit cash flows against discount rates from a national pension discount curve a yield curve used to measure pension liabilities 
based on the analysis  management used a discount rate of in  and we used an expected rate of return of for  and from a historical perspective  the rates of return on the plan were for  for  and for additionally  our philosophy has been to fund the plan annually to the maximum amount deductible under the internal revenue service rules 
as a result  as of december   the plan had a prepaid benefit cost of million  a current accumulated benefit obligation of approximately million  and plan assets with a fair value of approximately million 
fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires us to recognize the funded status of the plan defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation on the balance sheet and to recognize in other comprehensive income any gains or losses and prior service costs or benefits not included as components of periodic benefit cost 
detailed information on our pension plan and the related impacts of these changes on the amounts recorded in our financial statements can be found in note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities a third area that requires subjective and complex judgments on the part of management is the review of the investments in the securities portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
eitf issue and fasb fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  require us to review our investment portfolio and determine if it has impairment losses that are other than temporary 
in making its determination  management considers the following items the length of time and extent to which the current market value is less than 
table of contents cost  evidence of a forecasted recovery  financial condition and the industry environment of the issuer  downgrades of the securities by rating agencies  whether there has been a reduction or elimination of dividends or interest payments  whether we have the intent or ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery of fair value  and interest rate trends that may impact recovery and realization 
during the first quarter of  we recognized a million impairment loss relating to certain collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
as of december   our securities portfolio included certain securities that were impaired  by definition 
we reviewed each of these securities to determine if any of the impairments were other than temporary 
using the criteria listed above  we determined that none of the impairments were other than temporary as of december  goodwill and other intangible assets fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill  however  it does require periodic testing for impairment 
we completed our impairment test in accordance with statement no 
in october and concluded that no impairment writedown was warranted 
at december   we had approximately million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
other accounting regulatory issues in the normal course of business  cadence makes loans to related parties  including our directors and executive officers and their relatives and affiliates 
we make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  the loans are consistent with sound banking practices and within applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
please see note o in the notes to consolidated financial statements and our proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of generally prohibits loans to executive officers 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans that the bank makes to executive officers are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act 
during  we owned nbc capital corporation ms statutory trust i and enterprise tn statutory trust i  both organized under the laws of the state of connecticut for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
revised december  the trusts  which are considered variable interest entities  are not consolidated into our financial statements because the only activity of the variable interest entities is the issuance of the trust preferred securities

net interest income increased by in and in changes in net interest income may be divided into two components the change in average earning assets volume component and the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities

the increase in interest rates also had a positive impact on other earning assets  as the yield on federal funds sold increased from to and the yield on the investment securities portfolio increased from to 
the increase in rates had a negative impact on our cost of funds  as our cost of deposits increased from to and our cost of other borrowings increased from to 
also  the increase in rates resulted in an inverted yield curve

the provision for loan losses decreased from million in to million in but increased to million in the decrease in the provision for resulted from an overall improvement in the credit quality in the portfolio  and the significant increase for is due to the deterioration of some large credits  including two commercial loans  a bankruptcy of a customer  and an agricultural loan  as well as a softening in certain real estate sectors and a general softening in the economy 
please see the financial condition section of this management s discussion and analysis for additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
at this time  management expects the level of the provision for loan losses to protect us from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
however  if during the year  any or all of these factors change in direction or speed  we will make the necessary adjustments in the provision for loan losses to reflect these changes 
noninterest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions we collected  including insurance commissions earned by galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cadence 
it has been  and continues to be  one of our strategic objectives to diversify our other income sources so that we can be less dependent on net interest income 
other income decreased from million in to million in the changes in the major categories between and are as follows in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees  and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees securities gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income impairment loss on securities other total other income 
table of contents service charges on deposit accounts increased by in  mostly due to improved management and oversight of our noninterest bearing accounts 
insurance commissions  fees  and premiums increased by in  because of an increase in profit sharing received from the insurance carriers based on loss experience 
other service charges and fees increased by  primarily due to increases in checkcard income and retail investment income 
trust department income increased by  because of higher asset balances under management 
mortgage loan fees increased by  as a result of our recent restructuring of the division and the expanding of our mortgage operations into our newer markets 
other noninterest income decreased significantly in this decline is mostly due to the following items included in noninterest income a  gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio  a  increase in earnings from our investment in a low income housing partnership  and  in gains on early extinguishment of debt related to prepayments on certain federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
changes in other accounts were not individually material 
we recognized  in net securities losses during  compared with  in net securities gains during during the first quarter of  we recognized a million impairment loss on certain cmos and mortgage backed securities 
those securities were sold in early april and the proceeds reinvested in agency securities 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
those securities were sold in the fourth quarter of for amounts approximating their fair values

other service charges and fees increased by  primarily due to increases in official check income  checkcard income  and retail investment income 
other noninterest income increased by in this increase is mostly due to the following items included in other noninterest income a  gain on the sale of our credit card portfolio  a  increase in earnings from our investment in a low income housing partnership  and  in gains on early extinguishment of debt related to prepayments on certain fhlb borrowings 
also  other noninterest income includes an  gain related to our interest in the pulse card clearing network  which was sold during the first quarter 
changes in other accounts were not individually material 
we recognized  in net securities gains during  compared with net gains of  in in addition  during the third quarter of  we recognized a million other than temporary impairment charge relating to certain fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
those securities were sold in the fourth quarter of for amounts approximating their fair values 
noninterest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses 
these expenses increased from million in to million in the following table shows the detailed changes in the major categories of noninterest expense between and 
table of contents in thousands change salaries employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment communications data processing advertising professional fees intangible amortization other total other expense the increase in salaries can be attributed to three primary factors a full year of salaries related to the former suncoast and seasons branches acquired in  a full year of salaries related to branches opened in memphis and brentwood  tennessee in  and salaries related to new branches in hoover  alabama and franklin  tennessee opened in for  salaries related to the former suncoast and seasons branches increased by million  salaries related to the new branches in memphis and brentwood increased by  and salaries expense for the new branches in hoover and franklin totaled  exclusive of these items  our overall salaries expense remained virtually flat  as normal raises were offset by increased staffing efficiencies 
however  employee benefits expense decreased by in  due primarily to pension costs associated with certain retirements in the increase in net occupancy expense and the increase in furniture and equipment expense are mostly due to increased depreciation  facility rental  and equipment rental expenses associated with new branches opened in hoover  alabama  and franklin  tennessee  and a full year of expenses related to the newer branches in memphis and brentwood and the former suncoast and seasons branches 
these branches accounted for million of the million increase in expense in these two categories from to none of the changes in the other expense categories were considered to be individually material 
noninterest expenses increased from million in to million in the following table shows the detailed changes in the major categories of noninterest expense between and in thousands change salaries employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment communications data processing advertising professional fees intangible amortization other total other expense the increase in salaries in and the increase in employee benefits in can be attributed to three primary factors salaries and employee benefits related to the new de novo branches in hoover  alabama and brentwood  tennessee  additional salaries and employee benefits related to the former suncoast and seasons branches  and pension costs associated with certain scheduled retirements 
salaries and employee benefits expense for the de novo branches totaled  for  salaries and employee benefits related to the former suncoast and seasons branches totaled  for  and pension expense increased by  as a result of the scheduled retirements 
exclusive of these items  our overall salaries and employee benefits expense increased by approximately  due mostly to normal raises and the addition of certain key staff positions 
the increase in net occupancy expense in and the increase in furniture and equipment expense in are mostly due to increased depreciation  facility rental  and equipment rental expenses associated with the de novo branches  
table of contents the new branches opened in memphis and the former suncoast and seasons branches 
these added branches accounted for  of the  increase in expense from to the increase in advertising expense in is due to our market expansions  as well as additional system wide promotional and public relations campaigns run during the year that included the promotion of the new cadence bank name 
none of the changes in the other expense categories were considered to be individually material 
changes in our income tax expense in each year have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were in  in  and in these changes resulted primarily from the mix of income from tax exempt investments and the percentage relationship of tax exempt income to total pre tax income 
the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and our normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements limit our ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments 
in summary  net income increased from million  or per diluted share  in  to million  or per diluted share  in  but declined to million  or per diluted share  in the reduction in earnings per share in can be attributed to several factors  including the first quarter impairment loss of million million after tax  or per share  the million increase in our provision for loan losses million after tax  or per share  and the increase in average weighted shares outstanding  resulting from the million stock offering and shares issued in the suncoast acquisition during the reduction in earnings per share in was caused primarily by the additional shares issued with the stock offering and the suncoast acquisition 
additionally  the diluted earnings per share for were impacted by the one time impairment charge of million million after taxes  or per share 
the impact of this charge was partially offset by the gain on early extinguishment of debt of  and the gain on the sale of our credit card loan portfolio of  these two items in equated to million  after taxes  or per share 
financial condition our balance sheet showed an increase in total assets from billion at december   to billion at december  this was an increase in total assets of approximately million  or 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the investment securities portfolio decreased slightly from million in to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the declines in cash and securities in as compared to were used to partially fund our loan growth 
the loan portfolio grew from billion at the end of to billion at december  the increase during was million  or 
this growth originated in our alabama  tennessee  and florida markets 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million  or  from million to million 
we have tightened our underwriting standards for certain segments based on recent changes in market conditions 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the transactions in the allowance for loan losses for the three year period ended december  the following table reflects some of the statistics we use to evaluate the quality and potential exposure within our loan portfolio

the liability side of the balance sheet increased from billion at december  to billion at december   an increase of million  or 
during  deposits declined by million  or  to billion 
the decrease resulted from a million  or  decrease in interest bearing deposits  and a million  or  decrease in non interest bearing deposits 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million  or  from million to million 
also during  fhlb advances increased by million  or 
the changes in liability mix occurred because during much of  retail deposits  specifically certificates of deposit cds  were costing to basis points more than wholesale funds 
as a result  management decided to allow the single service retail cds to leave the bank and to replace them with cheaper wholesale funding 
our objective is to fund loan growth with the proper mix of retail and wholesale funding that will maximize net interest income and yet maintain our core deposits at the appropriate level 
the million decrease in subordinated debentures between and is due to the redemption of the trust preferred securities issued by enterprise tn statutory trust i  a connecticut business trust of which we are the sole shareholder 
this trust was dissolved in january capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity increased from million as of december  to million as of december  during  we earned net income of million and declared approximately million in dividends 
accumulated other comprehensive income improved from an unrealized loss of million in to an unrealized loss of million in the positive difference between and in accumulated other comprehensive income included a million increase in the market value of the available for sale portion of our investment securities portfolio  a  adjustment to our pension liability  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 and a  unrealized gain on interest rate swaps during the capital to asset ratio decreased from at december  to at december  peer organizations are traditionally in the to range 
current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
as of december   we maintained a leverage ratio of  significantly exceeding the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized financial institution is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes allowance for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes allowance for loan losses of 
at the end of  we had a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
dividends paid by the corporation are provided from dividends received from cadence 
under regulations controlling national banks  the payment of dividends by a bank without prior approval from the comptroller of the currency is limited in amount to the current year s net profit and the retained net earnings of the two preceding years 
at december  
table of contents without approval from the comptroller of the currency  cadence s ability to pay dividends was limited to approximately million  plus earnings to be generated in liquidity  inflation and asset liability management liquidity may be defined as our ability to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
we have not experienced any problems with liquidity during and anticipate that all liquidity requirements will be met in the future 
our traditional sources of funds from deposit growth  maturing loans and investments  wholesale borrowing lines and earnings have generally allowed us to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet our daily operational liquidity needs 
as the result of a million increase in loans and a million decrease in deposits in from  our loan deposit ratio increased from in to in our total funding sources include not only deposits  but also federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb borrowings 
when we include these sources of funding with deposits  our loans to total funding ratio increased from in to in management s target loans to deposits ratio is in the range of  and our goal is to limit wholesale funding to no more than of total assets 
we offer retail repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of our larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
retail repurchase agreements  which we view as a source of funds  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of retail repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts and our asset liability funding policy 
because of the limited amount of retail repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under our control  we do not consider the exposure for this service material 
in september  we entered into a million structured repurchase transaction 
this transaction was a standard repurchase transaction with a fixed rate of and a forty two month term 
the transaction has a quarterly call option after one year 
in december  we entered into a million structured repurchase transaction 
this transaction was a standard repurchase transaction with a fixed rate of and a three year term 
the transaction has a quarterly call option after one year 
we believe that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional fhlb borrowings  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow us to meet our obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   we had the ability to borrow approximately million from the fhlb under the blanket line  a million available line of credit from the federal reserve  and other unused short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
as of december   we had million in outstanding fhlb borrowings 
in december  we extended a secured line of credit with an upstream correspondent that provides us access to borrow up to million 
these borrowings may be used to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes  provided that the borrowings used for purposes other than acquisitions do not exceed million 
the term of the line of credit is two years 
interest on each borrowing will be paid at the lender s base rate or at libor  plus annually 
we also pay a commitment fee  accruing at the annual rate of  on the daily amount of the unused commitment 
borrowings are contingent on our ability to maintain various operational and financial covenants 
we have pledged  shares of cadence bank stock as collateral for these borrowings and additionally have agreed that such pledged shares will have a minimum book value of million 
we have no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the fhlb borrowings 
we do not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity 
our stock repurchase plan gives management the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of our common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
any purchases under this program will be made over an unknown period of time  and the necessary funds will be provided from internal sources 
under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  cadence is limited in the amount it can lend to the corporation  and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no loans between cadence and the corporation 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
fluctuations in interest rate and actions of the federal reserve board to regulate the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do 
table of contents the higher costs for goods and services 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
the asset liability management committee evaluates and analyzes our pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for decision making and to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  our goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
as of december   our balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of our total assets and indicates that we have achieved a basically neutral rate sensitive position 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
management believes that interest rates will continue to trend downward during and that our current position places us in the correct interest rate risk posture for this rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in our best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  if interest rates move against predictions  then cadence s earnings will be less than predicted 
because of our neutral rate sensitive position  we do not believe that inflation has a significant impact on our financial results 
we maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during focusing on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations during  we hedged a portion of our floating rate prime based lending portfolio using floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
as of december   we had one outstanding swap with a notional amount of million  an original maturity of twenty four months  and a rate of 
this transaction was initiated to protect us from future downward fluctuations in the prime rate and to help ensure a more consistent cash flow from interest earned by our prime based lending portfolio 
this transaction is a cash flow hedge as defined by fasb statement no

we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of our investment portfolio as held for trading 
in  we entered into five floating to fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of our floating rate prime based lending portfolio 
one of these hedges remains outstanding at december  the transactions are cash flow hedges as defined by fasb statement no 
and are accounted for under the provisions of such statement 
these transactions are in line with our asset liability strategy and were entered into to help protect the corporation against an unexpected downturn in short term interest rates 
as we continue to enhance our asset liability management  we will continue to look for opportunities to protect the corporation from unexpected changes in interest rates 
we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which can either reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels 
in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative three months twelve months five years total interest earning assets loans investment and mortgage backed securities federal funds sold and other interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowed funds sensitivity gap dollar amount percent of total interest earning assets 
table of contents the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a positive cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider effective interest rate management an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor our irr  our interest rate management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control as described below 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
we first prepare a base strategy  which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or most likely interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
risk control consists of setting policies and parameters regarding interest rates and performing simulations based on trends and projections 
interest rate risk is managed based upon our tolerance for interest rate exposure and the resulting effect on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
a balance sheet and income statement simulation model is prepared monthly  using current month end data 
a base case simulation is prepared monthly using current month growth trends  projected forward and a flat rate forecast 
two additional interest rate shock simulations are prepared  one showing rates rising basis points and one showing a basis point decline in rates 
our policy is that a basis point shock in rates should not cause the projection of net interest income to change by more than and cause the economic value of equity to change by more that than and 
the december model reflects net interest income under this scenario increasing by with a basis point upward shock of rates and decreasing if rates are shocked down basis points 
at december   a basis point immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted in a increase in market value of equity  and a basis point instant decrease would have resulted in a decrease in market value of equity 
at december   we are within policy on both of these tests  and management believed that changes in net interest income and market value of equity  as reflected in our models  were acceptable
