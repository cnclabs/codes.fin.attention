item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements due to factors including  but not limited to  those factors set forth under part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop and market devices that make it possible to access  manage  control and configure electronic devices over the internet and other networks 
we are a leader in providing innovative networking solutions 
we were initially formed as lantronix  a california corporation  in june we reincorporated as lantronix  inc  a delaware corporation in may our products are sold to distributors  oems  vars  and systems integrators  as well as directly to end users 
fiscal year financial highlights and other information a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fiscal year ended june  are as follows net revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in our device networking product lines offset by a million  or  decrease in our non core product lines 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in gross profit margin percentage was primarily attributable to an increase in certain inventory reserves in connection with a review of our product offerings as part of our effort to simplify our product portfolio by discontinuing slow moving and non strategic products 
loss from operations was million  or  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million  or  for the fiscal year ended june  the loss from operations for the fiscal year ended june  included a restructuring charge of net loss was million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fiscal year ended june  the net loss for the fiscal year ended june  included a restructuring charge of  the net loss for the fiscal year ended june  included a gain on the sale of long term investment of  cash and cash equivalents were million as of june  compared to million as of june  net accounts receivable were million as of june  compared to million as of june  annual days sales outstanding dso in receivables were days for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to days for the fiscal year ended june  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by the timing of shipments within a quarter  our collections performance and the fact that a significant portion of our revenues are recognized on a sell through basis upon shipment from distributor inventories rather than as goods are shipped to distributors 
net inventories were million as of june  compared to million as of june  annual inventory turns were for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to for the fiscal year ended june  recent accounting pronouncements in september the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february the fasb approved fasb staff position  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our future consolidated financial statements related to non financial assets and liabilities 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including its emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants and the sec did not or are not believed by us to have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to net revenues  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  valuation of deferred income taxes  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  warranty reserves  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we do not recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
therefore  the recognition of net revenues and related cost of revenues from sales to distributors are deferred until the distributor resells the product 
net revenues from certain smaller distributors for which point of sale information is not available  is recognized approximately one month after the shipment date 
this estimate approximates the timing of the sale of the product by the distributor to the end user 
when product revenues are recognized  we establish an estimated allowance for future product returns based on historical returns experience  when price reductions are approved  we establish an estimated liability for price protection payable on inventories owned by product resellers 
should actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  additional reductions to revenues would result 
our products typically carry a one or two year warranty 
in addition  certain products that were sold prior to august carry a five year warranty 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs that differ from our estimates 
as a result  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
additionally  we sell extended warranty services  which extend the warranty period for an additional one to three years  depending upon the product 
warranty net revenues are recognized ratably over the warranty service period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
we also maintain a reserve for uncertainties relative to the collection of officer notes receivable 
factors considered in determining the level of this reserve include the value of the collateral securing the notes  our ability to effectively enforce collection rights and the ability of the former officers and lantronix director to honor their obligations 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess and obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future sales demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally three to twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
in addition  specific reserves are recorded to cover risks in the area of end of life products  inventory located at our contract manufacturers  deferred inventory in our sales channel and warranty replacement stock 
if our sales forecast is less than the inventory we have on hand at the end of an accounting period  we may be required to take excess and obsolete inventory charges  which will decrease gross margin and net operating results for that period 
valuation of deferred income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero  primarily due to historical net operating losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would be required to reverse the valuation allowance that would be reflected as an income tax benefit at that time 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis  and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value requires significant judgment and is based on management s best estimate  which generally considers the unit s expected future earnings 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating fair value  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment losses 
as of june   we have million of goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate purchased intangible assets when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying values of these assets are impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital is used to estimate the fair value of the assets 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenues  the remaining estimated economic lives of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of our purchased intangible assets 
in the event they are lower  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain purchased intangible assets could be required 
as of june   we have approximately  of purchased intangible assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
fiscal years ended june  and net revenues by product line the following table presents net revenues by product line years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages device enablement device management device networking non core net revenues the increase in net revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was primarily a result of an increase in net revenues from our device enablement products offset by a decrease in our non core and device management products 
the increase in our device enablement products for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to an increase in sales of our embedded and external device enablement products 
we are no longer investing in the development of our non core product lines and we expect net revenues related to these products to continue to decline in the future as we focus our investment in our device networking product lines

gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of raw material components  subcontract labor assembly from contract manufacturers  manufacturing overhead  amortization of purchased intangible assets  establishing or relieving inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products or raw materials  warranty costs  royalties and share based compensation 
the following table presents gross profit years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages gross profit the decrease in gross profit margin percentage for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was primarily attributable to an increase in certain inventory reserves in connection with a review of our product offerings as part of our effort to simplify our product portfolio by discontinuing slow moving and non strategic products

restructuring charges the following table presents restructuring charges years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages restructuring charge during the fourth fiscal quarter ended june   we implemented a restructuring plan to optimize our organization to better leverage existing customer and partner relationships to drive revenue growth and profitability 
as part of the restructuring plan  employees from the senior level ranks of the sales  marketing  operations and engineering groups were terminated 
interest expense  net the following table presents interest expense  net years ended june  of net of net change revenues revenues in thousands  except percentages interest expense  net the increase in interest expense  net  is primarily due to interest expense related to the addition of capital leases during the fiscal year ended june  and lower yields on cash deposits

provision benefit for income taxes on july   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
in connection with the adoption of fin  we recognized an adjustment of approximately  to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on our consolidated balance sheet 
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of june   we had recorded  of uncertain tax positions including approximately  of accrued interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
at july   our fiscal through fiscal tax years remain open to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities 
however  we have net operating losses nols beginning in fiscal which would cause the statute of limitations to remain open for the year in which the nol was incurred 
the following table presents our effective tax rate based upon our income tax provision years ended june  effective tax rate we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax benefit is the result of a reduction in estimated foreign taxes and penalties 
the federal statutory rate was for all periods 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effect of our domestic losses recorded without a tax benefit  as well as the effect of foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
as a result of our cumulative losses  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the fiscal years ended june  and as of june   we had net operating loss carryovers of million and million for federal and california income tax purposes  respectively 
the federal and california net operating loss carryovers begin to expire in fiscal years and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity since inception through fiscal  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and operating activities 
we refer to the sum of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as cash for the purposes of discussing our cash balance and liquidity 
the following table presents details of our working capital and cash june  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital increased and cash balances decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in net inventories and an increase in restructuring reserves  other liabilities and accrued payroll 
in addition  the change in our cash balance is significantly impacted by our cash management activities  which included the timing of cash payments to our vendors and the timing of cash receipts from our customers 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available from our line of credit will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our net revenues  research and development  expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments  and expenses related to government investigations and litigation  which could affect our ability to generate additional cash 
if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may need to raise capital by borrowing funds through bank loans  the selling of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to operate our business 
in may  we entered into a two year secured revolving loan and security agreement line of credit with a bank  which provides for borrowings up to million 
the borrowing capacity is limited to eligible accounts receivable as defined under the line of credit 
as of june   we had no borrowings against the line of credit 
in august  we amended the line of credit  which provides for a three year million term loan and a two year million revolving credit facility 
the term loan was funded during august and is payable in equal installments of principal and monthly accrued interest 
borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at the greater of or prime rate plus per annum 
if we achieve two consecutive quarters of positive ebitdas as defined in the line of credit greater than  and only for so long as we maintain ebitdas greater than at the end of each subsequent fiscal quarter  then the borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at the greater of or prime rate plus per annum 
the following table presents our available borrowing capacity and outstanding letters of credit  which were used to secure equipment leases  deposits for a building lease  foreign value added tax account deposits and security deposits june  in thousands available borrowing capacity outstanding letters of credit as of june   approximately  of our cash was held in foreign subsidiary bank accounts 
this cash is unrestricted with regard to foreign liquidity needs  however  our ability to utilize a portion of this cash to satisfy liquidity needs outside of such foreign locations is subject to approval by the foreign location board of directors 
cash flows the following table presents the major components of the consolidated statements of cash flows years ended june  in thousands net cash provided by used in net loss adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash provided by used in operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities accounts receivable inventories contract manufacturers receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets other assets accounts payable accrued payroll and related expenses accrued settlements warranty reserve restructuring reserve other liabilities net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities provided cash during the fiscal year ended june  this was primarily the result of non cash reconciling items offset by a net operating loss and cash used by operating assets and liabilities 
in order of significance  the changes in operating assets and liabilities which had a significant impact on the cash used in operating activities included i a decrease accounts payable as a result of the timing of cash payments to vendors  ii a decrease in inventories as a result of a million decrease in finished goods inventory and a  decrease in large scale integration chips  which are sold individually and embedded in our products  iii changes in accounts receivable and contract manufacturers receivable as a result of the timing of collections  and iv an increase in accrued payroll and related expenses due to the timing of our fiscal year end payroll
