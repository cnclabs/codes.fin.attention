modifications to our plans will be based on many factors  including results of exploration  assessment of data  weather conditions  exploration costs  the price of uranium and available capital

during the twelve month period following the date of this annual report  we anticipate that we will not generate any revenues 
we anticipate that additional funding to carry out all our plans will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock 
future financings we require additional financing to carry out our full program of exploration and property acquisitions during we plan to complete additional sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operations and to fund our working capital 
issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any financings 
failure to obtain additional financing on a timely basis would require a reduced plan of operations and acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the audited financial statements included in this annual report 
mineral property costs the company is primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration and  if warranted  development of mineral properties 
mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with eitf whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets when management has determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified and adequate financial resources are available or are expected to be available as required to meet the terms of property acquisition and budgeted exploration and development expenditures 
mineral property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred if the criteria for capitalization are not met 
in the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of the company s shares  the mineral property will be recorded at the fair value of the respective property or the fair value of common shares  whichever is more readily determinable 
when mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the company  those future payments  whether in cash or shares  are recorded only when the company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the shares 
when it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and pre feasibility  the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized 
during the year ended december   mineral property expenditures totaling    were expensed and the company received mineral property option payments of  stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r  share based payments  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense  based on estimated fair values  for all share based awards  made to employees and directors  including stock options 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model as its method of determining fair value 
this model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these subjective variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period 
no tax benefits were attributed to stock based compensation expense because a full valuation allowance was maintained for all net deferred tax assets
