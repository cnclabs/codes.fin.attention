item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview historically we have been an ophthalmic product development company focused on ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary durasite drug delivery technology 
beginning in  we have expanded beyond ophthalmic products to other topical anti infectives  including the treatment of ear infections 
our intent is to continue to solidify our franchise in ocular anti infective topical therapies as well as extend our anti infective platform to non ocular topical products 
our durasite sustained delivery technology is a proven  patented synthetic polymer based formulation designed to extend the residence time of a drug relative to conventional topical therapies 
it enables topical delivery of a solution  gel or suspension and can be customized for delivering a wide variety of potential drug candidates 
we are currently focusing our research and development and commercial efforts on the following topical anti infective products that formulate the antibiotic azithromycin with our durasite drug delivery technology 
azasite azithromycin ophthalmic solution isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin  was developed to serve as a broad spectrum ocular antibiotic  approved by the fda in april to treat bacterial conjunctivitis pink eye  and launched by inspire pharmaceuticals in august the key advantages are a significantly reduced dosing regimen leading to better compliance and outcome  with a broad spectrum antibiotic  and a lowered probability of bacterial resistance based on high tissue concentration 
azasite plus isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin and a corticosteroid is under development for ocular inflammation and infection  or blepharoconjunctivitis  for which there is no fda approved indicated treatment  we initiated a pivotal phase trial in december azasite otic isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin and a corticosteroid  is under development for the treatment of bacterial infections of the middle ear otitis media  and is in preclinical development 
azasite xtra isv  a durasite formulation with a higher percentage of azithromycin  is in preclinical development for the treatment of ocular infection and is targeted at international markets 
major developments in in our primary developments were related to our azasite product and included receipt of million from inspire upon the february  licensing to inspire of the manufacturing  sales and marketing and future development rights to azasite for the united states and canada  nda approval of azasite by the fda on april   which triggered a million milestone payment from inspire  launch of azasite in the united states by inspire in august and recognition of our first royalties in the third quarter of  and entrance into our first international licensing agreement for azasite with shin poong in december in we also continued our development of several additional product candidates that incorporate our durasite sustained delivery technology and azithromycin  including successful completion of a phase clinical trial for our azasite plus product candidate  initiation of an azasite plus pivotal phase trial in december  and preclinical development activities for the azasite otic product candidate 
business strategy our business strategy is to in license promising product candidates and technologies from academic institutions and other companies and apply our formulation expertise to create novel differentiated product opportunities  subsequently conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and partner with pharmaceutical companies in the late stages of clinical trials to manufacture  market and sell our products 
for select opportunities  we may manufacture  market and sell our own products 
we also have internally developed durasite based product candidates using either non proprietary drugs or compounds developed by others for non ophthalmic indications 
currently we are leveraging our success with the durasite azithromycin product platform to develop additional ocular and non ocular topical anti infective products 
as with in licensed product candidates  we either have partnered or generally plan to partner with pharmaceutical companies to complete clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
arrangements with multiple elements are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf our revenues are primarily related to our licensing agreements  and such agreements may provide for various types of payments to us  including upfront payments  research funding and related fees during the term of the agreement  milestone payments based on the achievement of established development objectives  licensing fees  and royalties on product sales 
upfront  non refundable payments under licensing agreements are recorded as deferred revenues once received and recognized ratably over the period related activities are performed 
revenues from non refundable milestones are recognized when the earnings process is complete and the payment is reasonably assured 
non refundable milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized ratably over the period related activities are performed 
revenue related to contract research services is recognized when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonable assured 
we receive royalties from licensees based on third party sales and the royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues related to sales of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  were recognized when all related services had been rendered and collectibility was reasonably assured 
accordingly  revenues for sales of ocugene may have been recognized in a later period than the associated recognition of costs of the services provided  especially during the initial launch of the product 
inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the inventory is based on the first in first out method 
if the cost of the inventory exceeds the expected market value  a provision is recorded for the difference between cost and market 
income taxes 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard board  financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
subsequent recognition  derecognition and measurement is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
we file us federal and california state income tax returns 
to date  we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
to date  there have been no interest or penalties charged to us in relation to the underpayment of income taxes 
we have generated net losses through the year ended december  and  accordingly  did not record a provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we generated net income and were able to offset it with our accumulated net operating losses  or nols 
as of december   our total deferred tax assets were million 
the deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax nol carryforwards 
due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to continue to generate future taxable income to realize these tax assets  a full valuation allowance has been established to offset our deferred tax assets 
additionally  the future utilization of our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income is subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that have occurred previously and may be further impacted by future ownership changes 
as necessary  the deferred tax assets have been reduced by any carryforwards that expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations  with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
these carryforwards may be further reduced if we have any additional ownership changes in the future 
stock based compensation 
in we granted stock based awards to eligible employees and directors to purchase shares of our common stock under our stock compensation plan approved in the plan and its successor the performance incentive plan the plan approved in october in addition  we have a qualified employee stock purchase plan in which eligible employees may elect to withhold up to of their compensation to purchase shares of our common stock on a quarterly basis at a discounted price equal to of the lower of the employee s offering price or the closing price of the stock on the date of purchase 
the benefits provided by these plans qualify as stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires us to recognize compensation expense based on their estimated fair values determined on the date of grant for all stock based awards granted  modified or cancelled as of january  the effective date 
prior to the effective date  we did not recognize any compensation cost in our income statements for stock based awards granted with an option price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant or employee stock purchase rights as we accounted for them under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and its related interpretations and adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 stock based compensation sfas 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of compensation expense for employee stock options and purchase rights 
at december   we had million in unrecognized compensation cost related to employee stock options remaining  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing method black scholes method  which was also used for the proforma information required to be disclosed under sfas the determination of fair value of share based awards using an option pricing model requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of share based compensation cost recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
these include estimates of the expected term of share based awards  expected volatility of our stock price  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate 
these estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and may result in materially different amounts should circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in our application of sfas r in future periods 
for stock based awards issued during the year ended december   we estimated the expected term by considering various factors including the vesting period of options granted and employees historical exercise and post employment termination behavior 
expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of the company s common stock and the common stock of the company s competitors  the expected moderation in future volatility over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and other factors 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
we currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development and expansion of our business and for general corporate purposes 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  financial covenants  tax laws and other factors as the board of directors  in its discretion  deems relevant 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the stock based awards 
results of operations revenues 
we had total revenues of million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
million of our revenues in represented the amortization of the license fee and milestone payments for azasite that we received from inspire in february and april  respectively 
 of our revenues represented royalties from net sales of azasite by inspire through december  the remainder of our revenues represented sales of materials to inspire under the supply agreement  sales of our azasite finished goods inventory to inspire and contract services provided to inspire related to their azasite activities 
revenues for and were from sales of ocugene 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues was million   and  for  and  respectively 
cost of revenues for reflects royalties accrued for third parties  including pfizer  through december   the cost of the azithromycin supplied to inspire under the supply agreement and the cost of the azasite inventory sold to inspire 
cost of revenues in and reflected the cost of ocugene tests performed as well as the cost of sample collection kits distributed for use 
research and development r d 
our r d activities can be separated into two major segments  research and clinical development 
research includes activities involved in evaluating a potential product  related preclinical testing and manufacturing 
clinical development includes activities related to filings with the fda and the related human clinical testing required to obtain marketing approval for a potential product 
we estimate that the following represents the approximate cost of these activities for  and in thousands as of december  research clinical development total research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in in our activities primarily included production of azasite process validation batches  expenses related to the azasite canadian nds filing  azasite plus preclinical activities  phase clinical trial data evaluation  pilot study  phase clinical trial design and initiation and preclinical work on azasite otic and azasite xtra 
our r d personnel costs were higher in due to success bonuses related to the successful fda approval of azasite 
in  our activities had been primarily related to the azasite clinical trials  preparation of the related nda and the fda filing fee 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from in costs related to clinical research organizations and the microbiological testing related to our azasite phase clinical trials decreased approximately due to the completion of the trials in january costs related to additional headcount  consultants and temporary labor to assist with the preparation of the azasite nda and to file the azasite plus ind offset these expense decreases 
preclinical costs related to the azasite plus program  the manufacture of the azasite plus phase clinical trial supplies and preparation to manufacture azasite phase clinical units at our contract manufacturing site also partially offset this decrease in external clinical costs in additionally  in we incurred approximately  of non cash expense related to the adoption of fas r and the expensing of options granted to employees and our employee stock purchase plan 
our future research and development expenses will depend on the results and magnitude or cope of our clinical  preclinical and research activities and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies 
accordingly  our research and development expense may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  if we in license or out license rights to product candidates  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from prior periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase mainly reflects higher personnel related expenses associated with an increase in headcount  payment of bonuses upon the approval of the azasite nda  salary and health insurance cost increases and higher non cash stock based compensation in the second year after implementation of fasr 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in the deferred debt issuance costs related to the short term senior secured notes which were repaid in february general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase mainly reflects the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to our short term senior secured notes  consulting costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and approximately  of non cash expense related to the adoption of fas r and the related expensing of options granted to directors and employees and our employee stock purchase plan 
interest  other income expenses  net 
interest expense and other income was an expense of  million and  in  and  respectively 
in february  our senior secured notes were repaid in full and  correspondingly  interest expense decreased compared to when these notes were outstanding for the full period 
the increased expense in mainly reflects accrued interest payable on our short term senior secured notes issued in december and january and the accretion of the value of the debt discount related to the warrants issued as part of the note financing 
interest paid in the future will increase and the amount will be dependent on the repayment of the notes issued in february secured by royalties received from inspire for the sales of azasite 
interest earned will be dependent on prevailing interest rates and the amount of funds we use for our operating activities 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  debt financings  equipment and leasehold improvement financing and payments from corporate collaborations 
at december   our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were million 
it is our policy to invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes 
the current uncertain credit markets may affect the liquidity of such money market funds or other cash investments 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  primarily due to million of license and milestone payments from the february license of azasite to inspire 
for the years ended december  and  cash used for operating activities was million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million   and  for  and  respectively  primarily related to cash outlays for additions to laboratory and other equipment 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the repayment of short term notes payable in february cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively  principally due to warrant and option exercises  private placement equity offerings and debt issuances 
the tables below set forth the amount of cash that we raised for fiscal years through from warrant and option exercises  stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  equity financings and debt financings 
cash received from warrant and option exercises and employee stock purchase plans year net proceeds million cash received from private placements of equity securities date net proceeds shares of common stock issued august million million plus warrants to purchase million shares may million million plus warrants to purchase million shares cash received from private placement of notes date net proceeds type of notes interest rates and terms maturity date january million short term senior secured notes through july   from july  through february  february  december million short term senior secured notes through june   from july  through february  february  on february   we repaid and redeemed all outstanding principal and interest due under such notes 
in addition to the above  in we repaid  of short term notes payable to directors  members of senior management and other stockholders  with interest at rates from to and which matured on march  we received payments on a note from a stockholder of  and  in and  respectively 
our future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our clinical testing  research and development programs and preclinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to successfully commercialize azasite  azasite plus  ocugene and any other products that we may launch in the future  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative and licensing relationships  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
we anticipate no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on our environmental compliance record to date  and our belief that we are current in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
see subsequent event for discussion of our february   issuance of million of notes 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
some of these amounts are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration  the possibility of renewal and other factors 
because these estimates are necessarily subjective  our actual payments in the future may vary from those listed in this table 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations facilities lease obligations purchase obligations licensing agreement obligations total commitments we lease our telephones and telephone equipment under two capital lease agreements which expire in we lease our facilities under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  consulting contracts  manufacturing activities  equipment maintenance  and other significant purchase commitments 
we have entered into certain license agreements that require us to make minimum royalty payments for the life of the licensed patents 
the life of the patents which may be issued and covered by the license agreements cannot be determined at this time  but the minimum royalties due under certain of these agreements are as noted for through subsequent event in february  our wholly owned subsidiary issued million in aggregate principal amount of non convertible  non recourse promissory notes due in the notes are secured by  and will be repaid from  royalties to be paid to us by inspire pharmaceuticals from sales of azasite in the united states and canada 
the annual cash coupon rate on the notes is with interest payable quarterly in arrears beginning may  net proceeds to insite from the financing were slightly over million after deducting transaction costs and setting aside million as interest reserves 
this interest reserve will be reflected as restricted cash on our balance sheets commencing march  when the azasite royalties received for any quarter exceed the interest payments and certain expenses due that quarter  the excess will be applied to the repayment of principal of the notes until the notes have been paid in full 
the notes may be redeemed at our option  subject to the payment of a redemption premium through may after that date they may be redeemed without a premium

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   we had million invested in interest bearing operating accounts 
while a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  levels would cause a decrease in interest income  it would not result in a loss of the principal 
additionally  the decrease in interest income would not be material 
the current uncertain credit markets may affect the liquidity of such money market funds or other cash investments
