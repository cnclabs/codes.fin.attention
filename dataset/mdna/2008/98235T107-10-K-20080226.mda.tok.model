the remaining increase in international sales is attributable to continued growth in asia and certain european markets  which were partially offset by declines in france and italy 
our hip product sales totaled million in  representing a increase over our international markets were the primary driver of this growth  posting an increase over  led by sales in our asian markets  most notably in japan 
further contributing to the international sales increase is our european business  particularly in those markets where we launched market expansion initiatives in domestic hip sales increased in  driven by increased unit sales of our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity and our conserve total implant with bfh technology 
our international hip sales include a million favorable currency impact compared to sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing growth of over year over year growth in our advance knee systems in both our international and domestic markets  which totaled and  respectively  was partially offset by declines across our other  more mature knee product offerings

international biologics sales increased by over prior year  primarily attributable to the continued success of our market expansion initiatives in certain european regions 
our extremity product sales increased to million in  representing growth of over this year over year growth was primarily driven by the continued success of our charlotte foot and ankle system and sales of our darco plating systems after the second quarter acquisition 
our domestic and international extremity product sales increased and  respectively  over product sales from the acquisitions contributed approximately and percentage points of growth to domestic and international extremity net sales  respectively  in looking ahead to  we anticipate growth in both our international markets and our domestic business  as we continue to see the positive results of our acquisitions and as the strength of our current product portfolio combines with our anticipated product launches in cost of sales 
in  our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in this decrease is attributable to manufacturing efficiencies in  which were partially offset by unfavorable shifts in our sales mix 
our cost of sales included percentage points and percentage points of non cash  stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
additionally  our cost of sales included percentage points of non cash inventory step up amortization associated with our acquisitions in our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume

geographically  our domestic net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in both years  and growth of 
our international net sales totaled million in  a increase as compared to net sales of million in this increase in international sales is attributable to increased sales in japan and market expansion initiatives launched in certain regions within our european operations during  which were partially offset by declines in france 
from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in sales across three of our four principal product lines 
for  we experienced growth of  and in our hip  extremity and biologics product lines  respectively 
our knee product line sales were flat in as compared to during  our hip sales growth was attributable primarily to success in domestic markets  specifically driven by our conserve total implant with bfh technology and our profemur line of primary stems featuring our innovative neck modularity 
the growth of our extremity business in was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of our charlotte foot and ankle system and our micronail intramedullary wrist fracture repair system 
the increase in our biologics business was primarily driven by performance in our international business  specifically where we launched our market expansion initiatives in our european operations

the remaining decrease was driven by increased interest income generated from our tax free investments 
seasonal nature of business we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our products are used in elective procedures  which generally decline during the summer months  typically resulting in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of sales that are higher than throughout the rest of the year 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons aaos 
this meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this three day event  we display our most recent and innovative products to these surgeons 

table of contents restructuring in june  we announced our plans to close our facilities in toulon  france 
this announcement came after a thorough evaluation in which it was determined that we had excess manufacturing capacity and redundant distribution and administrative resources that would be best eliminated through the closure of this facility 
the majority of our restructuring activities were complete by the end of  with toulon s production being transferred to our existing manufacturing facility in arlington  tennessee and its distribution activities being transferred to our european headquarters in amsterdam  the netherlands 
we have estimated that total pre tax restructuring charges will be approximately million to million  of which we have recognized million during we believe that we will see the benefits from this restructuring within selling  general and administrative expenses beginning in and within cost of sales beginning in see note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our restructuring charges

specifically  our investments in marketable securities at december   are available for redemption through an auction process every or days from initial purchase  and are considered trading securities 
while these investments are not considered cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes  due to the short term nature of these investments  we do not believe that these investments will have an impact on our overall liquidity position 
as of the date of filing  we have liquidated all of these investments into cash equivalents 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in  compared to  is primarily attributable to lower levels of profitability in the current year due to restructuring charges  which was partially offset by changes in working capital  as explained below 
our investment in marketable securities decreased during  as a portion of the invested balance was used to pay for our recent acquisitions 
accrued expenses increased  primarily due to liabilities recorded associated with our restructuring charges 
our inventory balance has increased due to safety stock that was built in connection with the announcement of our plans to close our toulon  france manufacturing facilities  as well as inventory built in preparation for product launches and to support higher levels of sales 
finally  the increase of our accounts receivable balance is attributable to higher levels of sales in international markets that typically have longer collection terms 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily attributable to million of cash used as a result of net changes in our marketable securities balances during  as compared to million used in lower levels of cash tax payments for us federal income taxes further contributed to the increase in operating cash flow for compared to investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in our industry is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of 
table of contents approximately million for for routine capital expenditures  as well as approximately million for the planned expansion of facilities in arlington  tennessee 
we invested million in acquisitions of businesses and intellectual property during we are continuously evaluating opportunities to purchase technology and other forms of intellectual property and are  therefore  unable to predict the timing of future purchases 
financing activities 
during  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which generated net proceeds of million 
the notes pay interest semiannually at an annual rate of 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  which represents a conversion price of per share 
we will make scheduled interest payments in related to the notes totaling million 
additionally  proceeds of million were generated from the issuance of common stock under our stock based compensation plans 
during  we made approximately million in principal payments related to our long term capital lease obligations 
in addition  our operating subsidiary in italy continues to factor portions of its accounts receivable balances under factoring agreements  which are considered financing transactions for financial reporting 
the cash proceeds received from these factoring agreements  net of the amount of factored receivables collected  are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the proceeds received under these agreements in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
these proceeds were offset by payments for factored receivables collected of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we recorded obligations of  and million for the amount of receivables factored under these agreements as of december  and  respectively  which are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of  and we will make scheduled interest payments under our convertible senior notes of million 
we anticipate that our factoring program in italy will continue  however  the level and extent of the amounts factored under the agreement and the ultimate amount of proceeds received under the program cannot be predicted 
on december   after considering outstanding letters of credit  our revolving credit facility had available borrowing capacity of million  which can be increased by up to an additional million at our request and subject to the agreement of the lenders 
we currently have no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the sum of a base annual rate plus an applicable annual rate that ranges from to depending on the type of loan and our consolidated leverage ratio  with a current annual base rate of

the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements  which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
our purchase obligations reflected in the table above consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments under non cancelable contracts with consultants that are contingent upon future services

in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our domestic sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales 
a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to other royalties earned based on product sales

further  under our factoring agreement in italy  our liability for cash proceeds received of  discussed in financing activities may be subject to repayment upon days notice 
none of these amounts are included in the table above 

table of contents additionally  as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 
in addition  certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which generated net proceeds totaling million 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our marketable securities balance of million and our existing available credit line of million will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million and meet our contractual cash obligations in critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
however  certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated through two types of customers  hospitals and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are primarily sold through a network of independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals when the hospital takes title to the product  which is generally when the product is surgically implanted in a patient 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 

table of contents approximately  and  of sales related to these types of agreements were deferred and not yet recognized as revenue as of december  and  respectively 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately  and  are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience credit losses on our accounts receivable and accordingly  we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  our collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  we have experienced minimal bad debts from our hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international stocking distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine that the accounts receivable are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continuous collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically accurate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately not collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly and as such  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out fifo basis or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we incurred approximately million in charges within cost of sales to write down inventory to its net realizable value due to the termination of an agreement to distribute certain third party spinal products in europe 
additionally  in  we recorded charges of million associated with the closure of our manufacturing facility in toulon  france for inventory write offs and manufacturing costs incurred during a period of abnormal production capacity 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances 
table of contents or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
based on our single business approach to decision making  planning and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment may require the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting unit using projections of future cash flows 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation and amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  should we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on the asset s fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
in  we recognized an impairment charge of million for our property  plant  and equipment at our toulon  france facilities 
this impairment charge consisted of the write down of assets held for sale to their estimated selling price less costs to sell  as well as the abandonment of the remaining assets that are no longer in use 
product liability claims and other litigation 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where a range of loss has been established 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities and we believe our accruals are adequate 
our accrual for product liability claims was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
we are also involved in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection and other matters 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss can be developed 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carryforward of certain tax basis net operating losses and general business tax credits 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective january   which requires that the tax effects of an income tax position to be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of our tax liabilities 
table of contents involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
we recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
upon adoption of fin  we recorded a million reduction to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits 
we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
stock based compensation 
we calculate the grant date fair value of non vested shares as the average of the highest and lowest reported sales prices on the trading day immediately prior to the grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of these stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected life of options by calculating the average of the vesting period and the contractual term of the option  as allowed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
we estimate the expected stock price volatility based upon historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates where the term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected dividend yield is not considered as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our sfas r disclosures 

table of contents purchase accounting 
we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
to assist in determining the value of any intangible assets  a third party valuation is typically obtained as of the acquisition date 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows associated with the asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with standard valuation methods 
the estimates of future cash flows include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
restructuring charges 
we evaluate impairment issues for long lived assets under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for post employment benefits  for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time termination benefit arrangements and other costs associated with exit activities are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we have estimated the expense for our restructuring initiative by accumulating detailed estimates of costs  including the estimated costs of employee severance and related termination benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases and any other qualifying exit costs 
such costs represent management s best estimates  which are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for us on january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this standard expands the standards under sfas to provide entities the one time election to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas was effective for us on january  we did not elect the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future 
in june  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf states that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
these amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the provisions of eitf are effective for us on january  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r and sfas no

sfas r and sfas significantly change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value 
in addition  sfas r includes a substantial number of additional disclosure requirements 
sfas changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and 
table of contents classified as a component of equity 
we will apply the provisions of sfas r and sfas prospectively effective january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the interest rates associated with our invested cash balances 
on december   we had short term cash investments and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
based on this level of investment  a decrease of in interest rates would have a negative impact of  to our interest income 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
cost of sales related to these sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  operating costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from eu countries  which are denominated in the euro  and from japan  which are denominated in the japanese yen 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the yen 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro and the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period
