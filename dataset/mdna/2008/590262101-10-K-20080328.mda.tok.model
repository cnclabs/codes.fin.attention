the following table presents our key customers and the percentage of net sales made to such customers raytheon company lockheed martin corporation space systems loral northrop grumman corporation the boeing company sales to the foreign geographic area of europe were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the following table provides a breakdown of the net sales by customer industry segment and geographic area north america rest of world north america rest of world military and commercial satellites defense commercial the company markets and sells its products domestically and internationally through a direct sales force and manufacturers representatives 
merrimac has traditionally developed and offered for sale products built to specific customer needs  as well as standard catalog items 
the following table provides a breakdown of electronic components sales as derived from initial design orders for products custom designed for specific customer applications  repeat design orders for such products and from catalog sales initial design orders repeat design orders catalog sale orders the company orders from its defense and satellite customers were higher during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year nevertheless  in times of armed conflict or war  military spending is concentrated on armaments build up  maintenance and troop support  and not on the research and development and specialty applications that are the company s core strengths and revenue generators 
the company s orders during fiscal year for its multi mix microtechnology products exceeded levels 
the company anticipates orders to increase in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from prospective and existing customers and market research 
the company also expects improved first quarter sales  as compared to the first quarter of  due to the higher backlog that resulted from the increase in orders for the company continued to experience losses from continuing operations in due to lower gross profit from the impact of a lower sales level during the first half of having to absorb fixed manufacturing costs 
the lower sales levels of the first half of were due to reduced orders from delays in space and defense programs that lowered available backlog 
while the company reduced its cost structure during the beginning of  the increased orders and backlog during required additional hiring and their associated personnel costs 
sales increased during the second half of as compared to the second half of  due to the increased defense and satellite orders that were received starting in the first quarter of  but were not sufficient to restore annual profitability 
cost of sales for the company consists of materials  salaries and related expenses  and outside services for manufacturing and certain engineering personnel and manufacturing overhead 
our products are designed and manufactured in the company s facilities 
the company s manufacturing and production facilities infrastructure overhead are relatively fixed and are based on its expectations of future net sales 
should the company experience a reduction in net sales in a quarter  it could have difficulty adjusting short term expenditures and absorbing any excess capacity expenses 
if this were to occur  the company s operating results for that quarter would be negatively impacted 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continually reduce its manufacturing costs through design and engineering innovations and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce its manufacturing costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses exceeded capital expenditures for new projects and production equipment during by approximately  and the company anticipates that depreciation and amortization expenses will exceed capital expenditures in fiscal year by approximately  the company intends to issue up to  of purchase order commitments for capital equipment from various vendors 
the company anticipates that such equipment will be purchased and become operational during fiscal year the company s planned equipment purchases and other commitments are expected to be funded through cash resources and cash flows expected to be generated from operations  and supplemented by the company s  revolving credit facility  which expires october  the company anticipates the revolving credit facility will be renewed 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for administrative  selling and marketing groups  sales commissions to employees and manufacturing representatives  travel  product marketing and promotion costs  as well as legal  accounting  information technology and other administrative costs 
the company expects to continue to make significant and increasing expenditures for selling  general and administrative expenses  especially in connection with implementation of its strategic plan for generating and expanding sales of multi mix products 
research and development expenses consist of materials  salaries and related expenses of certain engineering personnel  and outside services related to product development projects 
the company charges all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the company believes that continued investment in research and development is critical to the company s long term business success 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods  and expect that these costs will increase over time  in order to develop new products  enhance performance of existing products and reduce the cost of current or new products 
discontinued operations filtran microcircuits inc fmi was established in  and was acquired by merrimac in february fmi is a manufacturer of microwave micro circuitry for the high frequency communications industry 
fmi has been engaged in the production of microstrip  bonded stripline  and thick metal backed teflon ptfe microcircuits for rf applications including satellite  aerospace  pcs  fiber optic telecommunications  automotive  navigational and defense applications worldwide 
fmi has supplied mixed dielectric multilayer and high speed interconnect circuitry to meet customer demand for high performance and cost effective packaging 
merrimac management determined  and the board of directors approved on august   that the company should divest its fmi operations with the view to enable merrimac to concentrate its resources on rf microwave and multi mix microtechnology product lines to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
beginning with the third quarter of  the company reflected fmi as a discontinued operation and the company reclassified prior financial statements to reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of fmi as discontinued operations 
on december   the company sold substantially all of the assets of fmi to firan technology group corporation  a manufacturer of high technology high reliability printed circuit boards  that has operations in toronto  ontario  canada and chatsworth  california 
the transaction was effected pursuant to an asset purchase agreement entered into between merrimac  fmi and ftg 
the total consideration payable by ftg was  canadian  plus the assumption of certain liabilities of approximately  canadian 
ftg paid  canadian  of the purchase price at the closing on december  and the balance was paid on february  following the conclusion of a transitional period 
operating results of fmi  which were formerly represented as merrimac s microwave micro circuitry segment  are summarized as follows years ended december  december  net sales loss before provision benefit for income taxes gain on sale of assets of discontinued operation provision benefit for income taxes net loss critical accounting estimates and policies the company s management makes certain assumptions and estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  and sales and expenses 
these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain 
the management judgments that are currently the most critical are related to the accounting for the company s investments in multi mix microtechnology  contract revenue recognition  inventory valuation and valuation of deferred tax assets 
below is a further description of these policies as well as the estimates involved 
impairment of long lived assets the following is a summary of the carrying amounts of the multi mix microtechnology net assets included in the company s consolidated financial statements at december  and the related future planned purchases and lease obligation commitments through january net assets property  plant and equipment  at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization property  plant and equipment  net inventories other assets  net total net assets at december  commitments planned equipment purchases for lease obligations through january total commitments total net assets and commitments approximately of the property  plant and equipment may be utilized in other areas of our electronic components and subsystems operations 
the company anticipates receiving additional orders during for its multi mix microtechnology products  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from new and existing customers and market research  for which substantial research and development costs have also been incurred 
any future demand for multi mix for the wireless market is dependent on various third party programs and is directly related to the timing of our customers and potential customers phase out of existing programs and their migration  which is not assured and has not yet commenced commercially  toward new programs to meet their customers new requirements 
while these circumstances have resulted in the delay or cancellation of multi mix microtechnology product purchases that had been anticipated from certain specific customers or programs  the company has implemented a strategic plan utilizing product knowledge and customer focus to expand specific sales opportunities 
however  continued extended delay or reduction from planned levels in new orders expected from customers for these products could require the company to pursue alternatives related to the utilization or realization of these assets and commitments  the net result of which could be materially adverse to the financial results and position of the company 
in accordance with the company s evaluation of multi mix under sfas no 
 the company has determined no provision for impairment is required at this time 
management will continue to monitor the recoverability of the multi mix assets 
contract revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
contract revenue and related costs on fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts that require customization of products to customer specifications are recorded when title transfers to the customer  which is generally on the date of shipment 
prior to shipment  manufacturing costs incurred on such contracts are recorded as work in process inventory 
anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations when identified 
revenue related to non recurring engineering charges is generally recognized upon shipment of the related initial units produced or based upon contractually established stages of completion 
the cost rates utilized for cost reimbursement contracts are subject to review by third parties and can be revised  which can result in additions to or reductions from revenue 
revisions which result in reductions to revenue are recognized in the period that the rates are reviewed and finalized  additions to revenue are recognized in the period that the rates are reviewed  finalized  accepted by the customer  and collectability from the customer is assured 
the company submits financial information regarding the cost rates on cost reimbursement contracts for each fiscal year in which the company performed work on cost reimbursement contracts 
the company does not record any estimates on a regular basis for potential revenue adjustments  as there currently is no reasonable basis on which to estimate such adjustments given the company s very limited experience with these contracts 
no revenue was recognized related to cost reimbursement contracts during the company recognized revenue of  related to cost reimbursement contracts in inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inventories are periodically reviewed for their projected manufacturing usage utilization and  when slow moving or obsolete inventories are identified  a provision for a potential loss is made and charged to operations 
total inventories are net of valuation allowances for obsolescence and cost overruns of  at december  and  at december   of which  and  respectively  represented cost overruns 
procurement of inventory is based on specific customer orders and forecasts 
customers have certain rights of modification with respect to these orders and forecasts 
as a result  customer modifications to orders and forecasts affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory for the related customers 
although we may be able to use some of these excess components and raw materials in other products we manufacture  a portion of the cost of this excess inventory may not be recoverable from customers  nor may any excess quantities be returned to the vendors 
we also may not be able to recover the cost of obsolete inventory from vendors or customers 
write offs or write downs of inventory generally arise from declines in the market value of inventory  and changes in customer demand for inventory  such as cancellation of orders  and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand and that we are not able to return to the vendor or charge back to the customer 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which should reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company s   and net losses weighed heavily in the company s overall assessment 
as a result of the assessment  the company established a full valuation allowance for its remaining net domestic deferred tax assets at december  this assessment continued unchanged from through consolidated statements of operations summary the following table reflects the percentage relationships of items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
percentage of net sales years ended unaudited december  december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charge operating loss interest and other expense  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss compared to net sales 
consolidated results of operations for reflect a decrease in net sales from of  or to  sales for included  of revenue recognized in connection with the early close out of a fixed price customer contract during the second quarter which contract did not recur in sales increased during the second half of as compared to the second half of  due to the increased defense and satellite orders that were received starting in the first quarter of backlog represents the amount of orders the company has received that have not been shipped as of the end of a particular fiscal period 
the orders in backlog are a measure of future sales and determine the company s upcoming material  labor and service requirements 
the book to bill ratio for a particular period represents orders received for that period divided by net sales for the same period 
the company looks for this ratio to exceed  indicating the backlog is being replenished at a higher rate than the sales being removed from the backlog 
the following table presents key performance measures that we use to monitor our operating results beginning backlog plus bookings less net sales ending backlog book to bill ratio orders of  a new merrimac record for a fiscal year  were received during fiscal year  an increase of  or percent compared to  in orders received during fiscal year backlog increased by  or percent to  at the end of fiscal year compared to  at year end  due to the increased orders received during the book to bill ratio for fiscal year was to and for fiscal year was to the orders  backlog and book to bill information for the current and prior periods exclude discontinued operations information 
cost of sales and gross profit 
the following table provides comparative gross profit information for the past two years increase decrease from prior year of net sales increase decrease from prior year of net sales gross profit gross profit for fiscal year was  a decrease of  or percent  and was percent of sales as compared to gross profit of  or percent of sales for fiscal year gross profit for fiscal year also included  from the early close out of a fixed price customer contract 
gross profit percentage increased during due to an improved product mix of higher margin items 
depreciation and amortization expense included in consolidated cost of sales was  an increase of  compared to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the addition of certain production and testing equipment for  approximately  of depreciation and amortization expense was associated with multi mix microtechnology capital assets as compared to  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for decreased by  or  and when expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points to compared to the selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower commissions on the lower sales level and lower administrative expenses 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for new products were  for  a decrease of  or and when expressed as a percentage of net sales  a decrease of percentage points to compared to substantially all of the research and development expenses were related to multi mix microtechnology  power amplifier products 
the company anticipates that these expenses will increase in future periods in connection with further implementation of our strategic plan for multi mix 
operating loss from continuing operations 
consolidated operating loss from continuing operations for was  compared to consolidated operating loss from continuing operations of  for the lower operating loss for was due to the lower research and development costs and selling  general and administrative costs compared to and restructuring charges that did not recur in interest and other expense  net 
interest and other expense  net was  for compared to interest and other expense  net of  for interest expense for includes the write off of  of unamortized deferred debt costs related to our prior financing agreement 
interest expense for and was principally incurred on borrowings under the term loans which the company consummated during the fourth quarter of and refinanced in october the lower cash balances during  due mainly to the march repurchase  in a private transaction  of  shares of its common stock for the treasury at per share for an aggregate total of  from a group of investors  generated less interest income on the company s free cash balances during as compared to income taxes 
on december   merrimac adopted fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
as of that date merrimac had no uncertain tax positions and did not record any additional benefits or liabilities 
at december   merrimac had no uncertain tax positions and did not record any additional benefits or liabilities 
merrimac will recognize any accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes 
internal revenue service code section places a limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards when an ownership change  as defined in the tax law  occurs 
generally  an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than percent change in ownership 
if such change should occur  the actual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  for tax purposes  would be limited annually to a percentage of the fair market value of the company at the time of such change 
the company may become subject to these limitations depending on change in ownership
