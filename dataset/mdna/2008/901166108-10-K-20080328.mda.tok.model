management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those consolidated financial statements

executive overview sales cross billion mark while fiscal was highlighted by a number of achievements for us at tween brands  with the most notable being our sales surpassing billion  we did not meet a number of expectations set for our performance 
we finished the year with  million in net sales  nearly higher than fiscal net sales of million 
however  net income decreased and earnings per diluted share decreased  to as a result of flat comparable store sales at limited too  deleveraging expenses and declining net income 
a restructuring charge related to our corporate restructuring  which is discussed in more detail on page  also contributed to the reported operating and net income decline 
the unfavorable impact on earnings per diluted share was partially mitigated by buying back million shares  or over of our common stock outstanding at the end of fiscal this was accomplished primarily through an accelerated share repurchase program with million ultimately being returned to shareholders by the end of the year 
we ended the year with million in cash and short term investments after investing million in new stores and other capital projects 
limited too limited too has consistently provided tween girls with the hottest fashion for all aspects of her ever changing life 
while there were a number of accomplishments throughout the year  our overall performance in fiscal failed to deliver the results we expected 
on the apparel side  we experienced a mid single digit decrease in average store sales overall  with casual bottoms having the most difficult year and casual skirts  shirts  graphic tees and casual pants also being less successful 
on the positive side  our non apparel business performed quite nicely  posting low double digit sales increases 
the main contributor to this growth was the lifestyles division  which is composed of electronic devices  games and bedroom furnishings 
in we became the mall based destination for webkinz tm  the plush animals carrying a secret code unlocking a virtual world of entertainment  education and safe communication with other tweens 
with the help of webkinz tm  the web related items department experienced a strong year and was a great contributor to our holiday sales success 
our sweaters  sweatshirts and dresses performed well this year  posting double digit average store sales increases  mainly due to our lightweight sweaters in all our girl s favorite colors 
additional better performing categories in our accessories business included hair  footwear and jewelry 
we continued to form and develop relationships with several new partners to help fill our shelves with the latest toys and games our technology driven tweens crave 
during the year  we partnered with kajeet to offer our girls the coolest cell phones 
we also teamed up with tween movie producers fox walden  the producer of nim s island tm and dolphin entertainment  the producer of the roxy hunter mystery series on nickelodeon television 
we are carrying an exclusive line of roxy hunter sportswear  inspired by the popular tv tween sleuth 
in addition  we maintained many existing relationships and were able to continue to provide our girl the most popular hannah montana merchandise 
our partnerships have helped us become the primary destination for our tween girl and her mom  not only for the latest fashion and styles  but also the most up to date technology must haves 
limited too continues to foster relationships with its customers through a variety of media 
in fiscal  we published catazine catalog and magazine combination editions  five more than we published in fiscal total circulation increased to over million books  a increase over fiscal our catazines remain our best advertising and promotional vehicles and the most effective way to communicate with our girls 
we continued our voicemail reminders  
table of contents birthday and report card promotions and have increased the use of e mail reminders as a way of alerting girls about sales  as well as distributing coupons for use in store and online 
for fiscal  limited too catazine circulation is planned to remain consistent with the level 
once again  our direct business had a phenomenal year  proving our girl and her mom are becoming increasingly comfortable with our e commerce site and the convenience it offers 
total direct catazine and web sales grew over fiscal we continued with the project started in late to refresh the look and navigability of our website  specifically focusing on how our sportswear assortment is presented 
although the rate of growth experienced in the past two years is not expected to be maintained  we anticipate the initiative discussed above along with our continued focus on the e commerce channel will increase sales and enhance our already strong limited too brand image 
justice in fiscal  justice continued its rapid growth by adding new stores to its portfolio  making it one of the fastest growing concepts in specialty retailing 
justice enjoyed a comparable store sales increase of  following an increase of for fiscal this increase was due to having the right fashion apparel  accessory and lifestyle product for our tween girls  coupled with a robust marketing program 
from a merchandising standpoint  the non apparel business was a key component to our sales growth in our girls interest in technology continues to move her toward shopping for web based toys and games such as webkinz tm  hand held electronics  toys and licensed product such as hannah montana 
our footwear business also experienced significant growth throughout the year  with strong performances in flip flops  ballet flats and boots 
in addition  our established sportswear apparel business continued to grow and posted comparable sales increases 
our shirts  sweaters  active shorts and dresses displayed solid growth by posting comparable sales increases over  mainly driven by the introduction of the longer skimp and baby doll silhouettes 
our line of intimates  comprising bras  underwear and sleepwear launched in early has been a positive addition to our apparel assortment and is off to promising start 
similar to limited too  casual bottoms  which is composed of pants  denim jeanswear and skirts had a disappointing year 
in fiscal  we continued to build on our relationship with tween girls and their moms by increasing the number of catazines from three in fiscal to in fiscal the additional eight catazines increased our circulation to over million  an increase of more than over last year 
our catazines continue to be an effective advertising vehicle as they drive traffic to our stores through the use of fashion photography as well as promotional offers 
total in home communication with our customers increased from last year as we built on our birthday mailings as well as several other direct mail offerings 
these mailings arrive complete with a coupon or sale reminder alerting our girls about in store sales and promotions on her favorite styles 
we continued our justice fun card program  which rewards our girls for shopping with us at certain times of the year spring  back to school and holiday and encourages them to return to use a discount during a specified redemption period 
international expansion our relationship with alshaya trading co 
wll continues with licensed limited too stores successfully operating in upscale malls in the kingdom of saudi arabia  kuwait  united arab emirates  jordan and qatar at the end of fiscal as of the date of this filing  there were stores opened under this licensing agreement 
while we are pleased with our middle eastern operations  we continue to seek out other appropriate international markets where we feel one or both of our brands would be successful 
in fiscal  we developed a partnership with family invest ab to operate limited too stores in scandinavia beginning in as of the date of this filing  we opened our first store under this arrangement in sweden 

table of contents restructuring during the last quarter of we undertook a study of our expense structure and overall staffing approach at our corporate headquarters 
as a result of this study we incurred a million restructuring charge consisting primarily of severance expenses and a third party consulting fee 
the charge is included in the store operating  general and administrative expenses line item of our consolidated statements of operations 
the charge reduced our annual earnings per diluted share by 
the restructuring better aligned the corporate functions with the goals and priorities of our two brands and their customers and will benefit us well into the future 
share repurchase programs as of fiscal year end  million was remaining under the august board authorized share repurchase program august share repurchase program 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we used million under the august share repurchase program to repurchase million shares 
in may  our board of directors reauthorized the share repurchase program and increased the amount available to million may share repurchase program 
subsequent to this reauthorization in the second quarter of fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares under the may share repurchase program  for million 
at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  million remained under the may share repurchase program 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding shares under the september share repurchase program 
the september share repurchase program supplemented the amount available under the may share repurchase program 
at the end of the fiscal year  all million had been used for repurchase purposes 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements and item c of part ii of this form k for further details 
purchases may occur from time to time in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  and in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will repurchase any additional shares under the may share repurchase program 
for the period february  through the date of this filing  there have been no share repurchases 
in the first fiscal quarter of we made our million settlement payment as required under the terms of our asr 
the payment reduced the authorization remaining under the may share repurchase program to million 
capital investment and resources we continue to evaluate and implement upgrades to our information technology systems for merchandise planning  inventory management  supply chain point of sales cash registers  real estate  finance and human resources 
the launch of these replacement systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five to six year period that began in in  we implemented new financial systems and replaced our real estate systems 
our capital spending plans for fiscal are forecasted to be between million and million  or to less than was invested in fiscal we intend to spend million to million on opening new stores and remodeling older limited too locations 
of the remainder  we estimate million will go toward the final payments relating to our home office and distribution center expansions  as well as spending for new home office and distribution center projects  and million will be invested in our information technology and other supply chain initiatives 
as in fiscal  we expect cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will fund all of our capital expenditures 

table of contents home office expansion in late  we completed a  square foot building addition connected to our existing new albany  ohio home office headquarters to accommodate our continued growth 
we also have a acre parcel of land adjacent to our home office  acquired in fiscal  to provide for anticipated growth well into the next decade

gross income fiscal the table below summarizes the change in gross income and buying and occupancy for the fiscal years ended february  and february  in thousands dollar change gross income add back buying occupancy costs internal gross income internally we analyze gross income by splitting it into two components 
internal gross income gross income excluding buying and occupancy cost is the first component and buying and occupancy costs is the second 
internal gross income is comprised of our more variable components of gross income  while our buying and occupancy costs are predominantly fixed in nature 
gross income for fiscal was  million greater than fiscal as shown in the table below in thousands  except basis point amounts vs

changes in dollar change change in bps internal gross income sales volume million improvement internal gross income rate million decline buying occupancy costs total change the increase in net sales drove the million shown above  while a bps decline in our internal gross income rate drove the million decline 
the bps decrease in our internal gross income rate is primarily attributable to increased markdowns in the spring season  as well as lower initial mark up imu driven by the relative growth of our justice brand and by the higher proportion of non apparel merchandise sales at both brands 
buying and occupancy costs increased million over fiscal  driven primarily by higher store occupancy expenses associated with new store additions at justice  rent increases resulting from lease renewals at higher rates at limited too  as well as increased limited too catazine costs 
fiscal the table below summarizes the change in gross income and buying and occupancy for the fiscal years ended february  and january  in thousands dollar change gross income add back buying occupancy costs internal gross income

changes in dollar change change in bps internal gross income sales volume million improvement internal gross income rate million decline buying occupancy costs total change the increase in net sales drove the million shown above  while a bps decline in our internal gross income rate drove the million decline 
the bps decrease in our internal gross income rate is primarily attributable to two factors a decreased merchandise margin in our limited too brand driven by the fall season markdowns as well as a merchandise shift towards electronics and lifestyle items  and the relative growth of our justice brand  which had a lower internal gross income rate than limited too 
buying and occupancy costs increased million over fiscal  driven primarily by increased store occupancy costs related to new store growth and higher catazine costs 
we leveraged these increased expenses  driving a bps improvement from fiscal store operating  general and administrative expenses fiscal store operating  general and administrative expenses increased million  or bps in fiscal from fiscal as outlined in the table below in thousands  except basis point amounts vs

changes in dollar change change in bps store operating expenses home office marketing distribution center other total change store operating expenses increased nearly in dollars in fiscal over fiscal  driven by the net addition of new stores  as well as a modest increase in average hourly rate 
however  we were able to leverage this increase 
home office expenses increased due principally to increased payroll expenses to support our continued growth  as well as higher hardware  software and consulting expenses in the information technology area 
marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased direct marketing spending at both brands 
other expenses increased primarily due to a million restructuring charge related to our cost savings initiative  as well as an increase in our direct fulfillment costs related to an increase in direct sales

changes in dollar change change in bps store operating expenses home office marketing distribution center other total change store operating expenses increased nearly in dollars in fiscal over fiscal  but remained unchanged as a percentage of sales  driven by the net addition of new stores and additional associate hours required by our higher sales volume 
home office expenses increased due to higher payroll costs to support our information technology and store growth  hardware  software and consulting expenses related to our multi year information technology initiative  and higher expenses related to our stock based compensation programs  resulting from the expensing of stock options as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
marketing expenses decreased due to the discontinuation of television advertising  used in fiscal during the spring and back to school seasons  partially offset by the cost of new marketing programs for our justice brand 
interest expense income  net fiscal interest income is earned on investments in money market securities  variable rate demand notes and short term  highly liquid  tax free municipal bonds 
interest expense is driven mainly by the interest payments on our long term debt 
for fiscal  net interest expense  amounted to million versus net interest income of million for the decrease in was attributed to interest expense on our long term debt  a lower invested asset balance and lower interest rates earned on our investments 
fiscal interest income is earned on investments in money market securities and short term  highly liquid  tax free and insured municipal bonds 
net interest income  amounted to million for fiscal versus million for the increase in was primarily attributed to favorable interest rates and lower credit facility and letter of credit fees 
provision for income taxes fiscal the total provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million for our effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in the rate increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in investment income from short term tax free municipal bonds 
fiscal the total provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million for our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in the slight rate decrease was primarily attributable to increased investment income from short term  tax free municipal bonds and the favorable settlement of certain state tax examinations 

table of contents our outlook for the future over the next few years we intend to open between and justice stores per year and add a small number of limited too stores each year  in situations meeting our internal return on investment requirements 
we also plan on remodeling approximately limited too stores per year 
justice stores will open primarily in power strip centers  while limited too stores may open in outlet centers  lifestyle centers or street locations  in addition to traditional malls 
on the international front  we will continue to work with alshaya trading co 
and family invest ab to open more limited too stores  as deemed appropriate  under our respective agreements 
at limited too  our marketing plan calls for over million catazines anticipated for circulation 
at justice  editions of our catazine  three more than in fiscal  and a circulation increase of reaching nearly million  is anticipated 
finally  we expect to launch our e commerce business for justice in fall of all these initiatives will continue to strengthen our relationships with our current customers and introduce more and more new tween girls and their moms to our exceptional brands 
we expect our annual consolidated gross income rate to improve slightly as we continue to leverage our design and buying and occupancy costs 
ultimately  we feel the justice gross income rate will approach the limited too rate 
despite this expected improvement  however  over the next few years  the gross income rate for justice is forecasted to remain below that of limited too 
the limited too gross income rate is expected to remain flat or decrease slightly as improvements in our apparel margins are offset by the growth of electronics and other lifestyle items  which traditionally have lower margins 
limited too margins may also be negatively impacted by increases in mall rents as we renew leases and open new stores 
gross income rates in any given period can be impacted by factors such as inventory levels  fashion hits and misses and merchandise mix 
we expect to incur incremental store operating  general and administrative sg a expenses in related to information technology enhancements and increased payroll in support of our various growth initiatives 
our store operating expenses will more than likely remain flat as a percentage of sales as minimum wage increases in numerous states are expected to increase our hourly rate  and offset any productivity improvements we achieve 
given our expected store growth  we feel our sg a rate as a percent of net sales will leverage slightly in  and then improve again in  as we recognize the benefit of our q corporate expense structure initiative 
we expect our statutory tax rate in fiscal to be between and  an increase of to bps from fiscal our effective rate will continue to be impacted by items such as municipal interest income  overseas operations and the settlement of any tax examinations which may occur in the future 
we believe tween brands is well positioned for future growth 
our newer brand  justice  has proven it can be a major retail contender and profit contributor and will serve as our primary growth vehicle for the foreseeable future 
our original brand  limited too  continues to seize opportunities for increased profitability and will continue to be the place in the mall for tween girls and their moms to get the hottest fashions 
for both brands  we are continually designing creative marketing initiatives to communicate our brand message to new customers and remind regular customers why limited too and justice are their favorite tween stores 
we expect to open our first store under our next concept  a store serving the fashion needs of both tween boys and girls  in the spring of we also expect to continue our international expansion by joining with qualified partners to operate licensed stores in additional international markets 
we do not intend to limit ourselves in the future to only physical storefronts to sell our products to tweens  and expect our e commerce business to deliver solid growth over the coming years as well 
by anticipating and delivering the hottest fashion our customers have come to expect  we intend to expand our market share  grow shareholder value and remain the leading tween retailer 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity financial condition during the third quarter of fiscal  we took steps to create a more efficient capital structure by adding long term debt 
we borrowed million in september under a term loan the term loan  which was used to repurchase nearly million shares of our outstanding common stock 
in assessing the financial condition of the business  we consider factors such as cash flow from operations  capital expenditures and investment activities to be key metrics to determine financial health 
our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong  as we were able to finance all capital needs with existing working capital and cash generated from operations  while still ending the quarter with million in cash and short term investments 
a more detailed discussion of liquidity  capital resources and expected future capital expenditures follows 
liquidity and capital resources we are committed to a cash management strategy that maintains enough liquidity to support the operations of the business and withstand unanticipated business volatility 
we believe cash generated from operations  together with current levels of cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to maintain ongoing operations  support seasonal working capital requirements and fund capital expenditures related to projected business growth 
in  we continued our share repurchase program in an effort to increase shareholder value 
on february   our working capital defined as current assets less restricted assets and current liabilities was million  down from million on february  the decrease was primarily due to the million of cash used since the beginning of the year to repurchase common stock under the august and may board approved share repurchase programs  as well as funding million in capital expenditures 
in an effort to increase shareholder value  we have and may continue to repurchase our common stock as conditions allow 
under our current may board authorization we may repurchase up to an additional million of our common stock after the final payment required under the terms of our asr 
we also plan to continue funding capital expenditures for store expansion and store remodeling 
although we expect continued improvement in our overall liquidity  we recognize the specialty retail industry can be highly volatile  where fashion missteps can quickly impact the ability to generate operating cash 
the table below summarizes our working capital position and capitalization in millions february  february  january  working capital capitalization long term debt shareholders equity total capitalization amounts available under the credit facility restricted assets our working capital has decreased  which caused our overall liquidity to dip slightly under the industry average as shown below 
additionally  we borrowed million under a term loan which was used to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock  which resulted in a current ratio and debt to equity ratio as shown below tween brands  inc apparel february  february  industry s p current ratio debt equity ratio information reflects the latest apparel stores industry financial ratios found on msn 
money 
table of contents our liquidity is enhanced by our new unsecured million credit agreement the new credit facility  which was entered into in september and replaced the october credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit  which can be increased to million at our option under certain circumstances  as well as the million term loan discussed in the cash flows from financing activities section 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 
our new credit facility contains certain financial covenants 
as of february  we are  and expect to remain  in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
while we expect to maintain significant overall liquidity  we recognize the specialty retail industry can be highly volatile and fashion missteps can quickly impact the ability to generate operating cash flow 
we continually evaluate and strive to optimize our capital structure 
we may  from time to time  make changes to our capital structure without prior notice  unless specifically required by applicable regulations 
these changes may include  but are not limited to  modifying our ongoing share repurchase program  offering stock or debt securities  borrowing under or amending our credit facility  and or taking on long term fixed or variable rate debt 
for a further description of our share repurchase program  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our interest payments are calculated on a short term variable rate of our choosing under the terms of the loan 
in december  we entered into a swap contract in order to fix the interest rate payment on a portion of the long term debt 
our cash flows are better matched to a fixed interest rate debt structure rather than a variable rate structure 
we chose variable rate debt with a swap contract  versus traditional fixed rate debt  because of the increased flexibility surrounding the terms available under this type of financing net change in cash and cash equivalents the table below summarizes our net change in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal years ended february   february  and january  in millions fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activites net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal amounted to million  up million from million in fiscal the table below outlines the changes in cash flow from operating activities during the year ended february  in millions vs changes in increase decrease net income  net of non cash expenses income taxes inventory accounts payable and accrued expenses tenant allowances received other total change in cash flows from operating activities 
table of contents the increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven in large part by an increase in tenant allowances received due to a focus on actively collecting outstanding allowances related to fiscal year  as well as an increase driven by the continued store growth of our justice brand 
also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses as compared to fiscal this was primarily related to higher payables outstanding at year end  specifically related to incentive compensation  gift card liability  severance accrual and accrued interest for our long term debt 
while inventory levels as reported on the balance sheet were higher at year end than at year end  we spent the cash more efficiently and therefore  were better positioned in the current year as was reflected in our store inventory per square foot decreasing over these increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease in net income  net of non cash expenses  and higher income taxes payable 
fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal amounted to million  down million from million in fiscal the table below outlines the changes in cash flow from operating activities during the year ended february  in millions vs changes in increase decrease net income  net of non cash expenses income taxes inventory accounts payable and accrued expenses tenant allowances received other total change in cash flows from operating activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher levels of inventory held at the end of fiscal as compared to the end of fiscal  partially offset by an increase in net income  net of non cash expenses 
inventory levels at year end were higher than year end levels or higher per square foot from year end 
however  when inventory is evaluated on a comparable time frame  that is weeks ago  it increased per square foot from this was composed of a increase at justice  and an increase at limited too 
the remainder of the increase was due primarily to a higher amount of inventory from our direct sourcing operation  which we typically take ownership of three to four weeks earlier than outsourced inventory 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses as compared to fiscal was primarily related to lower payables outstanding at year end due to shorter payment terms in fiscal and increased marketing expense  partially offset by higher accrued payroll expense 
our received tenant allowances grew slightly over driven by the continued growth of our justice brand

capital expenditures increased due to increased store construction related to our justice brand  the purchase of a acre parcel of land adjacent to our current corporate offices and technology related capital spending 
non qualified benefit plan funding was the primary driver for the remaining use of investing cash

these increases in cash use were partially offset by the change in our cash overdraft position 
future capital expenditures we anticipate spending between million and million in fiscal for capital expenditures 
this will be primarily for new store construction  remodeling of existing stores and continuing our information technology initiative 
we intend to add  to  square feet to our store base in  primarily through the growth of justice  representing a to increase over year end we estimate the average cost for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures for limited too stores to be opened in will be between  and  per store  before any tenant allowances we may receive 
this cost incorporates our it s a girl s world store format and our new wave store format 
average pre opening costs per store  
table of contents which are expensed as incurred  are expected to be approximately  while inventory purchases are expected to average approximately  per store 
we expect to open to new stores and anticipate remodeling approximately limited too stores in fiscal  the cost of which is comparable to that of opening a new store 
we plan to open between and new justice stores in fiscal  and anticipate the cost for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures for each of these stores to be between  and  before any tenant allowances we may receive 
pre opening costs for justice are similar to those of limited too 
however  inventory purchases for justice are expected to be slightly lower than those for limited too  averaging approximately  per store 
we continue to execute an extensive multi year information technology modernization program for merchandise planning  inventory management  supply chain  point of sales cash registers  real estate  finance and human resources to ensure our information technology infrastructure can fully support our expected growth 
in  we implemented new financial and loss prevention systems and replaced our real estate system 
in  we are planning approximately million related to our overall information technology strategy 
these costs and the related project timing are estimates  and therefore are subject to variation 
we expect cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operating activities will fund substantially all anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
transitional services and separation agreements in connection with the august spin off  we entered into several transitional services and separation agreements the transitional services agreements with limited brands regarding certain aspects of our ongoing relationship 
we believe that the terms of these agreements are similar to terms achievable through arm s length negotiations with third parties 
trademark and service mark licensing agreement at the time of the spin off  we entered into an exclusive trademark and service mark licensing agreement the trademark agreement with limited brands that allows us to operate under the limited too brand name 
the trademark agreement had an initial term of five years after the spin off  renewable annually at our option

refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further detail 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been minor 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  sales returns  self insurance and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following estimates and assumptions are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition store sales  net of sales tax  are recorded when the customer takes possession of merchandise 
sales discounts associated with our too bucks  bonus card and fun card programs are recognized upon redemption in conjunction with a qualifying purchase 
we classify associate discounts as a reduction of revenue 
direct sales  through our catazine and website  are recorded upon customer receipt 
amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue 
related shipping and handling costs are considered to be the direct shipping charges associated with direct sales and are reflected in cost of goods sold  buying and occupancy costs 
our international brand licensing fees are also included in revenues 
revenue from gift cards  gift certificates and store merchandise credits is deferred and recognized at the time of redemption 
the cards  certificates and credits collectively the gift cards have no expiration date 
a reserve is carried for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 
we accrue for estimated merchandise returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
actual return rates have historically been within our expectations of the reserves established 
however  in the event the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 

table of contents certain sales of advertising space in our catazine are included in revenue and are recognized when the catazine is mailed 
we sell the space to companies wishing to promote tween right brands and movies 
we evaluate these advertising transactions under eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we generally recognize the cash payments as revenue for all agreements entered into or modified after december  to the extent the payments do not exceed the fair market value of the catazine advertising space provided 
cash payments associated with agreements entered into prior to december  are accounted for as a reduction of cost of goods sold  buying and occupancy costs 
our last pre december  agreement was modified in late gift card breakage gift card breakage is based upon actual redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
this income is recorded as a reduction in store operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
operating leases rent expense for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rents over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial lease term includes the build out period of our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is accrued in the consolidated balance sheets 
tenant allowances tenant allowances received from landlords  typically in the form of one time cash payments or reduced rent charges for a specific length of time  are treated as lease incentives and are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the initial lease term  including the build out period  and any renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the unearned portion of tenant allowances from landlords is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
derivatives we account for derivatives under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we designate at inception whether the derivative contract is considered hedging or non hedging for sfas no 
accounting purposes 
for sfas no 
hedges  we formally document at inception the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the accounting hedge 
all derivative instruments are recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities depending on the rights or obligations under the contract 
the derivative instruments are to be measured at fair value based on expected future cash flows 
if the derivative is designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument shall be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the remaining change in fair value on the derivative instrument  if any  shall be recognized currently in earnings 
additionally  we use the hypothetical derivative method at the hedge s inception to assess whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item  in accordance with sfas no 
on an ongoing basis  we also assess whether the hedging relationship is expected to continue to be highly effective through utilization of either a dollar offset test or a statistical method 
we will discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be  or has ceased to be  highly effective as a hedge  and will then reflect changes in fair value in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship 
cash equivalents short term investments with original maturities of three months or less are generally classified as cash equivalents 
we also consider credit card receivables to be cash equivalents due to our policy of liquidating those balances daily  so that 
table of contents ordinarily we do not have more than days of outstanding collections 
we maintain cash deposits in banks that  from time to time  exceed the amount of deposit insurance available 
we periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions and believe any potential loss is minimal 
outstanding checks are classified in accounts payable and in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
store supplies the initial inventory of supplies for new stores including  but not limited to  hangers  signage  security tags  packaging and point of sale supplies is capitalized at the store opening date 
in lieu of amortizing the initial balance  subsequent shipments are expensed  except for new merchandise presentation items  such as signage  which are capitalized 
store supply balances are periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for changes in supply levels and costs 
investments investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and reported at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every to days 
we classify these securities as current assets despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities because we have the ability to quickly liquidate them to support current operations 
certain securities with long term contractual maturities are classified as held to maturity and are accounted for at amortized cost with any premium or discount amortized over the holding period 
we have classified these securities as held to maturity based on our intent and ability to hold them to maturity as determined at the time of purchase 
investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and adverse developments in that credit risk could restrict our ability to liquidate securities at their maturity or earlier 
restricted assets restricted assets represent investments held in an insurance trust for the benefit of our casualty insurance carrier 
store opening costs store opening costs  which include payroll and supply costs incurred prior to store opening are expensed as incurred 
inventories  net inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a weighted average cost basis  using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the use of the retail method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value 
we record a markdown for all inventory on hand when a permanent retail price reduction is reflected 
at the end of each selling season  we reduce the cost of our inventory to the estimated value of the inventory when it is ultimately removed from the stores  less the expected proceeds from the sale of the inventory to sell off vendors 
inherent in the retail method are certain management judgments and estimates including  among others  future sales  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and use markdowns to sell through merchandise 
we estimate and accrue our inventory shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 

table of contents accounts receivable  net accounts receivable consist primarily of tenant allowances from landlords  licensing fees from our international partner and miscellaneous trade vendor receivables and are continuously reviewed for their collectability 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is classified as offset in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
property and equipment  net property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis  using service lives for store assets ranging principally from the shorter of the lease term or years for leasehold improvements and to years for other property and equipment 
depreciation for fixed assets at our home office and distribution center are calculated using service lives of years for buildings  to years for furniture and fixtures and to years for computers and other office equipment 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
interest costs associated with the construction of certain long term projects are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized 
in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize certain costs associated with internally developed or modified software and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  usually to years 
these costs include  but are not limited to  employee payroll costs for time devoted to developing the projects as well as external direct costs for materials and services 
these costs are expensed until the software project reaches the development stage 
subsequent additions or upgrades to existing software are capitalized only to the extent that they add value and additional performance functionality 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
the capitalization of software requires our judgment in determining when a project has reached the development stage 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon identification of impairment indicators and  based on our judgment  would be considered impaired if their carrying value is less than anticipated future cash flows 
store assets are reviewed using factors including  but not limited to  our plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
impaired assets are written down to estimated fair value with fair value generally being determined based on discounted expected future cash flows 
catazine and advertising costs catazine costs for limited too  principally production and mailing costs  are expensed as costs of goods sold  buying and occupancy expense when the catazine is mailed 
these same costs for justice are included in store operating  general and administrative expenses as they are viewed as promotional materials to drive in store business since customers cannot place internet or direct mail orders for justice merchandise 
all other advertising costs  including costs associated with in store marketing and television and direct mail campaigns  are expensed at the time the promotion first appears in media or in the store as a component of store operating  general and administrative expenses 
advertising barter transactions we account for barter transactions in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for advertising barter transactions 
eitf issue no 
requires that barter transactions be recorded at the fair value of advertising surrendered only if the fair value is determinable based on the entity s own historical practice of receiving cash for similar advertising 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded no barter transactions 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax laws and published guidance with respect to applicability to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because we believe it reasonably certain that the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
income taxes on foreign operations are provided based upon the statutory taxes of the applicable foreign country

we have reviewed and continue to monitor the actions of the various financial and regulatory reporting agencies and are currently not aware of any other pronouncement that could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
seasonality historically  our operations and results have been seasonally skewed  with a significant amount of net sales and net income occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting increased demand during the year end holiday selling season and  to a lesser extent  the third quarter  reflecting increased demand during the back to school selling season 
during fiscal  the third and fourth fiscal quarters accounted for approximately of our sales 
as a result of this seasonality  any negative factors affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings  refurbishments and relocations  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to our long term debt 
at february   million was outstanding under the new credit facility and appears on our balance sheet as long term debt 
as such  we are currently exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the new credit facility 
additionally  we purchase investments with original maturities of days or less and also hold investments with original maturities of at least days but less than five years 
these financial instruments bear interest at fixed rates and are subject to potential interest rate risk should interest rates fluctuate 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our interest payments are calculated on a short term variable rate of our choosing under the terms of the loan 
as part of our risk management policy  we aim to minimize our exposure to interest rate variability and therefore entered into an interest rate swap contract in order to fix the interest rate payment on a significant portion of our long term debt during the fiscal year 
our cash flows are better matched to a fixed interest rate debt structure rather than a variable rate structure 
we chose variable rate debt with a swap contract  versus traditional fixed rate debt  because of the increased flexibility surrounding the terms available under this type of financing 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information regarding our financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the fair value of the swap agreements was determined based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at february  the table below is in thousands  except for percentage amounts
