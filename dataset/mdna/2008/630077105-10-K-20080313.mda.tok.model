item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are an innovator in the field of metrology systems for the semiconductor manufacturing industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and provide increased production yields and performance 
capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  especially in asia  and their suppliers are critical to our success 
the demand by these manufacturers and suppliers is driven by the expected market demand for new products and new applications 
the increasing complexity of the mm manufacturing processes for semiconductors is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems 
the incorporation of smaller features sizes  copper interconnect technology and optical critical dimension technology are expected to result in increased demand 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are primarily derived from product sales  which includes sales of accessories  but are also derived from customer service for the installed base of our products 
in  we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
changing trends in the semiconductor industry continue to drive the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include conversion to mm wafer size 
semiconductor manufacturers are converting to mm wafers to achieve better production efficiencies 
most facilities are incorporating this wafer size  and our newest products are well positioned to serve these facilities 
it is important that we are successful in product evaluations with these new mm facilities in order to continue to gain market share 
incorporation of optical critical dimension metrology in the patterning process 
our customers use phototlithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
our proprietary optical critical dimension systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 

table of contents copper interconnect technology 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the subtractive aluminum interconnect process with copper damascene technology 
this new copper processing technology has driven the need for new metrology techniques such as non destructive laser profiling and the use of optical critical dimension ocd technology for control of the copper process 
drive toward nm and nm feature sizes 
in an effort to reduce costs and increase device performance  semiconductor manufacturers are decreasing both the die size and feature size 
monitoring the increased tolerance requirements on smaller features sizes requires increased use of metrology systems 
in addition  new processing methodologies such as dual patterning are driving tighter requirements for imaging overlay metrology 
our thin film  overlay and critical dimension metrology systems are well suited and are being adopted for these next generation processes reduced number of customers 
because of the escalating cost of mm manufacturing facilities  fewer semiconductor manufacturers can afford the significant investment in these next generation facilities 
therefore  fewer opportunities for semiconductors equipment companies exist 
given that the available number of potential customers is decreasing  pre existing customer relationships  product positioning and critical mass take on greater importance 
adoption of new types of thin film materials 
manufacturers are adopting new processes and technologies that increase the importance and utilization of thin film metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers are utilizing copper and new  low dielectric constant low k insulating materials 
our advanced metrology solutions are required in the manufacturing process to characterize these materials 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and standalone metrology systems throughout the fab to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue includes hardware and software that is incidental to the products 
we derive revenue from three sources sales of its process control metrology systems  spare part sales and service contracts 
our arrangements with customers do not contain provisions to grant general rights of return to our customers 
our arrangements for sales of our systems often include customer specified objective acceptance criteria 
for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition occurs at the time title and risk of loss transfer  which usually occurs upon delivery  if we have reliably demonstrated that the product has successfully met the 
table of contents defined customer specified acceptance criteria  and all other recognition criteria have been met 
for initial sales of product where we have not previously met the defined customer specified criteria  product revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
in japan  where our contractual terms with the customer specify risk of loss and title transfers upon customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of written customer acceptance  provided all other recognition criteria have been met 
all products are assembled prior to shipment to customers 
we often perform installation for our customers  however  such installation is inconsequential and perfunctory as it may also be performed by third parties and is not considered essential to the functionality of the equipment 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized upon shipment and is included as part of service revenue 
service revenue also includes service contracts and non warranty  billable repairs of systems 
whereas service revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period under contract  service revenue related to billable repairs of systems not under contract is recognized as services are performed 
on occasion  customers request a warranty period longer than the company s standard month warranty 
in those instances where extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer  we follow the guidance of financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  associated revenue is deferred and recognized to income ratably over the term of the contract 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in deferred revenue 
furthermore  we do not provide our customers with return rights 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer when the warranty period expires 
the guidance in eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  is considered in cases where certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted at the same time 
in such cases  we defer the relative fair value of the undelivered element until that element is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
in order to recognize revenue associated with delivered elements  the following criteria must be met a the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and c delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria  the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until the criteria have been met or all elements have been delivered to the customer 
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is based on the amounts we sell equivalent products or services for on a stand alone basis 
our systems include hardware and software that is incidental to the system 
we periodically review the software element of its equipment systems in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of sp to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  to ascertain that the software continues to be incidental 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our risk associated with smaller rather than larger customers and that our reported allowances are adequate 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 

table of contents inventories we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the age of the inventory and potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional reserves may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we determined that there were two reporting units  products and services 
our impairment review process  which is completed as of the last day of november of each year  compares the fair value of our reporting unit to the carrying value  including the goodwill related to each of the reporting units 
to determine the fair value  we use the income method which is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for our reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and the company s assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital 
estimates of market growth  market share  and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we also considered its market capitalization on the dates of the impairment test in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
the fair value estimates are based on the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of these procedures can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement requires us to evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be not recoverable 
when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount  impairment may exist 
to determine the amount of impairment  we compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized 
product warranties we sell the majority of our products with a twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of acceptance which generally represents the date of shipment 
we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to the cost of products sold 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage  labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product 
table of contents failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  we may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide us in estimating our warranty accrual 
we also provide technical support to our customers as part of our warranty program 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes based on sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
in march  the sec issued sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was million which is expected to be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted average period of years 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant

our net revenues were comprised of the following categories in thousands  except percent in thousands fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems service total net revenues fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems service total net revenues in  net revenues from automated systems increased million as compared to reflecting demand for our automated and integrated products as semiconductor manufacturers continue to increase their manufacturing capacity 
also contributing to the higher revenues in was a full year of sales from accent and soluris related products 
incremental revenues from accent and soluris related products for  over the comparable levels  was million 
service revenue increased reflecting a full year of service activity from our accent and soluris acquisitions which contributed to higher sales of parts and services  due in part to a larger installed base of systems 
in addition  we experienced a higher level of in the field tool upgrades than in the previous year 
in  net revenues from automated systems increased as compared to as a result of additional revenues of million and million from accent and soluris related products  respectively 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a million decrease of sales from our flat panel display business unit  or fpd  in fiscal due to the sale of our fpd business unit effective in october see sale of flat panel display business unit  below 
sales of our integrated systems increased slightly as our channel distributors continue to integrate our products with growing end customers demand 
service revenue increased as a result of our accent and soluris acquisitions and due to more customers signing up for post warranty service contracts 
gross margins 
our gross margin breakdown was as follows in percent products service the product gross margin increased in as compared to due to improved efficiencies achieved from both higher volumes and the integration of manufacturing operations for accent and solaris related products 
also  contributing to the higher gross margin in were lower warranty expenses of million due to improvements in product reliability 
the improvement in gross margin for service in reflects the favorable margin achieved from our in the field tool upgrades and our focus on controlling expenses including personnel  personnel related expenses and material costs as compared to 
table of contents the product gross margin decreased to in as compared to gross margin of in the decrease was due to higher warranty costs of million and excess and obsolete inventory charges of million 
in addition  we incurred underutilization charges of million at our soluris facility acquired in march the negative gross margin for service improved in as compared to by the positive service margins received from the accent and soluris operations  however  we have not been able to fully recover the higher costs associated with meeting our customers increasing service demands 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses were comprised of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charge gain on sale of assets total operating expenses fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets merger termination fee asset impairment and disposition total operating expenses research and development 
the increase in research and development in of million reflects expenses for the full year related to the additional headcount and related development expenses associated with our acquisitions of accent in july and soluris in march  partially offset by lower stock based compensation charges of million 
the increase in research and development expenses in is due to the additional expenses of million and million associated with our acquisitions of accent and soluris  respectively  and to stock based compensation charges of million related to our adoption of sfas r 
the increase was partially offset by cost cutting initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of including the sale of our flat panel display business unit in japan and its related research and development function of million and reductions in headcount related expenses in the united states 
in the united states and united kingdom  our research and development efforts are focused on semiconductor metrology 
in south korea  our research and development efforts are focused on the overlay metrology 
we are committed to the development of new and enhanced products and believe that new product introductions are required for us to maintain a competitive position 
selling 
selling expenses increased million for the year over the comparable year of reflecting expenses for the full year related to the additional headcount and related expenses associated with the acquisitions of accent in july and soluris in march including higher commissions expenses of million associated with higher revenue levels 

table of contents selling increased in due to the addition of million associated with our acquisitions of accent in july and million associated with soluris in march in addition we have incurred stock based compensation charges of million related to our adoption of sfas r 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in increased slightly over the comparable period of as a result of termination charges of certain senior executives of million  consulting  travel and recruiting expenses of million and costs associated with enhancing our internal information technology infrastructure of million 
the increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses of million as we settled the patent litigation with nova in april  lower regulatory and accounting compliance costs of million and lower stock based compensation charges of million 
general and administrative expenses in increased as a result of increased headcount related expenses of million as we have expanded and enhanced our finance and administrative functions  higher legal expenses of million associated with our patent infringement lawsuits with kla and with nova  additional general and administrative expense from our acquisitions of accent and soluris of million  stock based compensation charges of million related to our adoption of sfas r and million of higher charges for professional services associated with compliance with regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act 
general and administrative expenses increased in as a result of professional services associated with compliance with regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act  legal expenses related to our patent infringement lawsuits  increased headcount relating to the expansion and enhancement our finance function and expenses associated with the restatement of our financial results for and the first two quarters of amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets for increased million from the comparable period in due primarily to incurring amortization charges for the full year in as compared to incurring amortization for only a part of the year in as the soluris acquisition closed in march and the accent acquisition closed in july restructuring charge 
during the third quarter of  we announced that we would close our milpitas  california machine shop and plating facility as part of our mission to reverse our manufacturing vertical integration and lower our breakeven point 
in conjunction with this closure  we recorded a restructuring charge of million consisting of million write down of fixed assets  million for professional fees and million for severance payments 
in thousands professional fees severance and other benefits other charges total restructuring charges non cash charges cash paid reserve balance at december  gain on the sale of assets 
in august we entered into a contract to sell a parcel of land and building in japan and realized a gain on the sale of million 
in addition  the sale of a condominium in california was consummated in july and we realized a gain of million in the third quarter of we also sold other non strategic assets during the third quarter of realizing a gain of million 
merger termination fee 
on january   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with august technology corporation 
on june   we and august technology announced the termination of the merger agreement 
on that date  in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  august technology paid us a merger termination fee of million plus million as reimbursement of our expenses associated with the merger agreement which we had capitalized in the first and second quarters of 
table of contents asset impairment 
in we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to certain assets in our fpd business unit 
under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we should assess the recoverability of assets when events become known which would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluated the estimated future cash flows of certain asset groups in our fpd business unit and determined the undiscounted estimated future cash flows would be insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets 
the impairment charge was measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset groups in excess of the associated discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge during the second quarter of other income expense 
our net other income expense consisted of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change interest income interest expense other loss income total other expense income net fiscal year change interest income interest expense other loss income total other expense income  net the lower interest income is due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower yields obtained on our investments 
interest expenses relate to our debt obligations in japan  which were fully paid in july  and the united kingdom 
in addition we incur interest expense associated with the sale of our accounts receivable in japan see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income expense includes foreign exchange gains losses  commission income and rental income and miscellaneous expenses 
with the acquisition of accent in  we incurred foreign exchange losses due to exchange rate fluctuations associated with extensive intercompany balances assumed with the transaction 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for and of million and million was primarily due to benefiting the losses of certain foreign jurisdictions where sufficient deferred tax liabilities exist 
our effective tax rate was nil   and in  and  respectively 
our income tax expense in was primarily a result of foreign income taxes as our us federal income taxes were primarily offset by a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
in the future  we will continue to review our expectations for future taxable income to determine the amount of valuation allowance necessary to reserve against deferred tax assets 
sale of flat panel display fpd business unit during  our fpd business unit experienced a significant decline in net revenues and related gross profit as other competitors entered the market for these products 
for  flat panel sales declined to approximately million  and less than gross margin  from approximately million of sales and gross margins of approximately for the corresponding prior year 
because of the expected continued decline in profitability  we decided to exit this market 
in september  we entered into an agreement to sell our fpd business unit to toho technology corporation  or toho  effective october toho received a non exclusive perpetual license to use and sell 
table of contents our film thickness measurements systems in the flat panel market in exchange for million 
in addition  toho will pay us a royalty on future sales in excess of million 
toho also purchased certain other existing assets from us including million of inventory and million of equipment related to the fpd business unit 
we did not recognize a gain or loss on this transaction as we had previously evaluated the estimated future cash flows of the fpd asset group and determined the undiscounted estimated future cash flows would be insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets and we recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter of see asset impairment above 
we have also agreed with toho to continue to provide sales efforts for fpd products and maintenance service for installed units in certain asian countries 
we will receive a commission from toho on their future sales of fpd products in certain designated countries 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments for the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from cash provided by operating activities of million  sale of assets of million and sale of shares under our employee stock option and purchase plans of million  partially offset by repayment of debt of million 
the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments for the year ended december  resulted primarily from cash used in operating activities of million  costs associated with our acquisitions of soluris and accent of million and repayment of debt of million  partially offset by maturities of short term investments of million and the sale of shares under our employee stock option and purchase plans of million 
we maintain arrangements under which eligible accounts receivable in japan are sold without recourse to unrelated third party financial institutions 
the sale of these receivables accelerates our cash collection and reduces our credit exposure 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
cash provided from operating activities for was million comprised primarily of certain non cash charges such as million of amortization of intangible assets  million of depreciation and million of stock based compensation offset by the net loss of million and increases in working capital of million due primarily to increases in accounts receivable of million reflecting the increase in our revenues 
uses of net cash for operating activities was million for was comprised of a net loss of million  increases in inventories of million offset by reductions of accounts receivable of million and non cash expenses of million 
the non cash expenses were comprised of depreciation and amortization of million from acquired intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of accent and soluris and by stock based compensation of million 
for comparison  cash provided by operating activities during of million was comprised of net income of million  including the merger termination fee of million  non cash charges of million including depreciation  amortization and an asset impairment charge of million  and reductions of working capital of million 
investing activities provided net cash of million and million in and  respectively  and used cash of million in in  we received sales proceeds of million from the sale of assets see preceding discussion for gain on sale of assets offset by capital expenditures of million

table of contents financing activities provided net cash of million and million in and and used net cash of million in  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for resulted from the million of proceeds of sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase and stock option plans offset by the repayment of debt of million and repurchases of stock of million 
cash used by financing activities for was due to repayments of short term and long term debt in japan of million and repayment of million of debt assumed in the accent merger 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock from the exercise of employee stock options of million 
cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the sale of shares under our stock options plans  offset to some extent by the net repayment of debt obligations by our japanese subsidiary 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
some of these activities might require significant cash outlays 
however  we believe working capital including cash and cash equivalents and funds available to us for our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our needs through at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require additional cash to fund acquisitions or investment opportunities or other events may arise in the future 
in these instances  we may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any equity or convertible debt financing we obtain may dilute your ownership interests and any debt financing could contain covenants that impose limitations on the conduct of our business 
in february  we entered into a two year agreement for a revolving line of credit facility in a maximum principal amount of million 
the instrument governing the facility includes certain financial covenants regarding net tangible worth 
all borrowings under this credit line bear interest  at our election  at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate or at the libor rate plus 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on our behalf 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets excluding intellectual property 
although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility  we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt obligations other long term liabilities operating lease obligations our debt obligations relate to an equipment financing arrangement in the united kingdom 
all amounts include interest  which we are obligated to pay 
we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components 
our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of december  was approximately million 
actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition  the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or cancelled 
certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk a substantial part of our business consists of sales made to customers outside the united states  and of sales in  and  respectively 
a portion of the net revenues we receive from such sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our costs of net revenues and our other operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and denominated in local currencies 
foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from current intercompany accounts in which costs primarily product costs from the united states and the united kingdom are charged to our foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are denominated in us dollars  japanese yen and british pounds and the net payable to the united states parent amounted to million as of december  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate at december  would result in less than million increase or decrease in transaction gains or losses which would be included in our net income 
in foreign locations we have million of net liabilities  including long term loans payable to the united states and  as a result  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate at december  would result in million increase or decrease in the net assets and a corresponding increase or decrease in other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk at december  and december   the company did not hold investments in marketable securities 
we have fixed rate debt obligations in the united kingdom that are denominated in british pounds sterling and have no interest rate risk 
at december  and december   our total debt obligation was million and million  respectively  with a long term portion of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical change in interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on our results of operations
