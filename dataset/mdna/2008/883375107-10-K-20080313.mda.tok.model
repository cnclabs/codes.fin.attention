in its brachytherapy seed business  the company produces  markets and sells theraseed  its premier palladium prostate cancer treatment device  i seed  its iodine based prostate cancer treatment device  and other related products and services 
theragenics is the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the majority of theraseed sales are channeled through third party distributors 
the company also maintains an in house sales forces and sells its theraseed and i seed devices directly to physicians 
the company s surgical products business consists of wound closure and vascular access products 
wound closure includes sutures  needles and other surgical products with applications in  among other areas  urology  veterinary  cardiology  orthopedics  plastic surgery and dental 
vascular access includes introducers and guidewires used in the interventional radiology  interventional cardiology and vascular surgery markets 
the company s surgical products business sells primarily to original equipment manufacturers and to a network of distributors 
the company has substantially diversified its operations and revenues in recent years 
prior to  the company s sole product was the palladium theraseed prostate cancer treatment device 
in  the company began to market an iodine based i seed prostate cancer treatment product 
in may  the company expanded into the surgical products business with the acquisition of cp medical corporation cp medical  followed by the acquisition of galt medical corp 
galt in august cp medical and galt comprise the company s surgical products business  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in prior to may  the brachytherapy seed business constituted of the company s revenue 
cp medical was acquired on may   for million  including million in cash and the issuance of common shares valued at million 
galt was acquired on august   for million net of million of cash acquired  including million in cash and the issuance of common shares valued at million 
the company borrowed million under its million credit facility in connection with the galt acquisition 
the company s consolidated results of operations include the results of cp medical and galt subsequent to their respective dates of acquisition 
restructuring the company implemented a restructuring of the brachytherapy segment in august that resulted in the closure of the plasma separation process psp facility in oak ridge  tennessee  ended the research and development activities related to the use of palladium in the vascular  macular degeneration and breast cancer areas  and eliminated production of radiochemical products the restructuring 
curtailing these activities allowed the company to shrink its asset base by shutting down six cyclotrons  closing the newton terrace facility in buford  georgia  and closing the psp facility 
the objective of the restructuring was to sharpen the company s focus on its two main business segments  brachytherapy seeds and surgical products  as well as provide a more focused platform for continued diversification and expansion through acquisitions or other channels 
as a result  restructuring charges of million were recorded in in  restructuring charges totaling  were recorded  as the company completed the shut down of its oak ridge facility 
the company also recognized gains on the sale of assets of  in  representing the sale of equipment idled by the restructuring 
the company is actively marketing its interest in its oak ridge facility  which has been shut down and held for sale since august ii results of operations following is a summary of revenue and operating income by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands revenue by segment year ended december  brachytherapy seed product sales continuing licensing fees one time license fees total brachytherapy seed surgical products intersegment eliminations consolidated operating income loss by segment year ended december  brachytherapy seed operating income one time license fees write down of asset held for sale restructuring related items  net other severance brachytherapy seed excluding special items surgical products intersegment eliminations operating income loss consolidated excluding special items operating income excluding special items is a non gaap financial measure used by management to make operational decisions  evaluate performance  prepare internal forecasts and allocate resources 
management believes presentation of these non gaap financial measures provides supplemental information that is helpful to an understanding of the operating results of the company s businesses and period to period comparisons of performance 
non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
ii year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue consolidated revenue increased over as a result of the increase in revenue in the surgical products segment 
results for include the results of galt for the entire year 
galt  which was acquired in august  was included for approximately five months in a significant portion of wound closure and vascular access products are sold to original equipment manufacturers and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
brachytherapy product sales decreased in  compared to this decrease was due to a decline in sales to our main distributor  partially offset by an increase in direct sales 
the sales decline to this main distributor was attributable to a reduction in transfer price  which was effective february   with the remaining decreases due to lower unit volumes 
the reduction in transfer price was given in recognition of competitive marketplace pressures and new distributor strategies 
the company also maintains its own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospitals and physicians 
revenue from direct sales increased in over  and direct sales totaled of brachytherapy product revenue in compared to in this increase in direct sales resulted from programs implemented by the direct sales force  and direct to consumer advertising programs 
the average selling price of the theraseed device sold directly to hospitals and physicians in was comparable to the company has two non exclusive distribution agreements in place for the distribution of the theraseed device 
the primary distribution agreement is with c 
r 
bard bard  which is effective through december  the bard agreement 
sales to bard represented approximately and of brachytherapy product revenue in and  respectively  and and of consolidated product revenue in and  respectively 
revenue generated from the second non exclusive distributor was not material in and is not expected to be material in the terms of the bard agreement provide for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires on december   and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice by december  of its intent not to extend the agreement 
in addition to the impact of the disappointing performance by our largest distributor  management believes that the brachytherapy industry continues to be affected by competition from alternative therapies  declining prices for iodine and palladium seeds  competitors selling tactics and the effects of consolidation in the industry 
medicare reimbursement policies have affected and  management believes  will continue to affect the brachytherapy market 
during medicare continued to reimburse for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
in december  congress enacted the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of  which extended the existing cost based reimbursement methodology through june  under current law  fixed reimbursement rates for seeds are scheduled to be implemented under medicare in july  see medicare developments below and that this and other factors can be expected to lead to continued pricing pressure from hospitals and other health care providers 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
revenue in the period included  of one time license fee revenue in the brachytherapy segment related to the licensee s receipt of the ce mark and european registration for therasphere in certain european countries 
during  license fees represented only the continuing royalties from continuing license fees from european and us product sales of therasphere 
commencing in the second quarter of  the licensing rate will be reduced to approximately one half of its current rate  and license fee revenue will decline accordingly 
expenses related to the license agreement will decline by a like amount  and no net effect on operating income is expected 
ii operating income and costs and expenses operating income excluding special items in the brachytherapy segment increased to million  more than double the million in this increase in profitability was a result of reductions in operating expenses in  partially offsetting the effect of lower revenue 
cost reductions were a result of operating efficiencies and other savings programs implemented in the last half of as a result of these cost reductions  gross margins on brachytherapy product sales increased to in compared to in  even as revenue declined in in december the company increased the estimated service lives of its cyclotron equipment from years to years 
the effect of this change was not significant in however  this change is expected to reduce manufacturing related depreciation expense by approximately million in other than this reduction in depreciation expense  manufacturing related expenses in the brachytherapy segment are not expected to continue to decline in  and the significant portion of brachytherapy manufacturing expenses will be fixed in nature 
in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the brachytherapy segment decreased by million as compared to these sg a reductions were primarily a result of decreases in advertising and professional fees 
we do not expect continued reductions in sg a expenses in during the company did record a  write down of the carrying value of its oak ridge facility  which has been shut down and held for sale since august this write down was based on the length of time the facility has been for sale  the general deterioration of the commercial real estate markets and recent signs of weakness in the overall economy in the united states 
operating income in the surgical products segment includes the results of galt  acquired in august gross margins in the surgical products segment were in and in and are dependent on product and sales channel mix 
in addition to the inclusion of galt for a full year in  operating income improved over the periods due to reductions in professional fees and bad debt expense partially offset by severance costs 
efficiencies were also realized because of the larger scale of the surgical products business in overall sg a expenses as a percent of sales in the surgical products segment decreased to in from in to support anticipated growth  the company expects to continue to make investments in staffing and other infrastructure in the surgical products segment 
accordingly  sg a expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of sales in future periods 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in  compared to  in the brachytherapy segment developed a new device to assist with the configuration of seeds 
this new device allows a physician to perform real time stranding of seeds and customize the brachytherapy procedure while in the operating room 
r d in the surgical products segment was primarily related to new product development 
these product development activities are focused on products that can be marketed once they have received k approval by the us food and drug administration  rather than products that would require costly and lengthy clinical trials 
looking forward  management expects consolidated r d expenses in to continue at levels similar to  with more r d incurred in the surgical products segment and less in the brachytherapy segment 
however  the rate of r d spending in could change based on the opportunities identified 
other income expense interest income was million in compared with million in the amount included  of one time interest income related to million of refunded federal income taxes 
this interest income was recognized in the second quarter of upon settlement of the irs examination of the company s federal income tax return 
other increases in interest income were a result of higher interest rates in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
interest expense increased from  in to  in  as the million in borrowings under the company s credit facility was outstanding for all of in  these borrowings were outstanding for approximately months 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable at libor plus  which was an effective rate of at december  and at december  the company expects to utilize its credit facility to provide flexibility for future strategic initiatives and diversification 
interest expense will be impacted by increases or decreases in the effective interest rate on the borrowings and any future borrowings to support expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
ii income tax expense the company s effective income tax rate for was 
in  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million 
this net benefit was a result of recognizing income tax expense of million  offset by a benefit resulting from the release of million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was released in as it became more likely than not the company s deferred income tax assets would be realized 
excluding the release of the allowance  the effective tax rate for would have been 
future tax rates can be affected by  among other things  changes in tax regulations  changes in statutory tax rates  changes in the tax jurisdictions in which the company must file income tax returns  and many other items that affect the taxability and deductibility of the company s revenue and expenses and for which we cannot currently predict 
the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest expense and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company has evaluated its tax positions for the tax years ended december    and  the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of december  with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to the company believes there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the irs completed an examination of the company s and federal income tax returns with no significant adjustments 
upon settlement of the audit  during the company received a refund of federal income tax previously paid of million 
this refund resulted from the carryback of tax losses that were reported in the company s federal income tax return 
the company also received  of interest income related to this refund 
the interest income was recognized in upon settlement of the irs examination of the income tax return 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue revenue in the periods included  of one time license fee revenue in the brachytherapy business related to the license of the company s therasphere product 
under the terms of the license agreement  this one time fee was due upon the licensee receiving the ce mark and european registration for therasphere in certain european countries  which was recorded in the third quarter 
the licensing agreement provides for continuing fees from european and us product sales of therasphere 
other increases in revenue in the periods were a result of increases in the surgical products segment 
includes revenue from galt  which was acquired in august  and a full year of operations of cp medical  which was acquired in may excluding the one time license fee revenue  brachytherapy sales decreased in from this decrease primarily reflects softness in sales to our main distributor  which decreased in decreases from the loss of another distributor in late were partially offset by increases in direct sales during the the company maintains its own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospitals and physicians 
direct sales increased from of brachytherapy product revenue in to in the average selling price of the theraseed device during was comparable to ii the company s primary brachytherapy distribution agreement in was with bard 
sales to bard represented approximately of brachytherapy product revenue in and in the company also had a non exclusive distribution agreement in place with a second distributor  though revenue generated from the second distributor was not material in prior to  the company also had a non exclusive distribution agreement in place with oncura  currently a part of ge healthcare the oncura agreement 
in december  oncura notified the company that it would not be renewing its distribution agreement effective december  and subsequently  the oncura agreement was terminated effective september  operating income and costs and expenses operating income excluding special items in the brachytherapy segment improved in primarily due to cost savings generated from the restructuring  which significantly reduced costs of manufacturing and research and development 
gross margins on product sales in the brachytherapy business were in  with costs of manufacturing totaling million 
brachytherapy operating income before special items in also improved from as a result of a reduction in direct to consumer activities  decreases in advertising  and decreases in legal expenses 
operating income in the surgical products segment increased by  in over  reflecting the acquisition of galt in august  and the inclusion of cp medical for the entire year in gross margins in the surgical products business were in  with costs of manufacturing totaling million 
as a component of gross margin  costs of manufacturing included  of non cash charges related to the purchase accounting for galt that did not recur in another  of non cash charges was included in selling  general  and administrative expenses related to galt purchase accounting that did not recur in operating income for also reflected higher personnel and other costs to support increased capacity and anticipated future growth  and higher professional fees resulting from sarbanes oxley related compliance costs 
research and development expenses declined significantly in the brachytherapy business in due to the restructuring and the discontinuance of the clinical trials and research programs underway at the time the restructuring was implemented 
other income expense interest income was comparable between the and periods 
higher interest rates and yields were offset by a decrease in invested funds due to cash used for the cp medical and galt acquisitions 
interest and financing costs increased from  in to  in the increase is a result of the million in borrowings under the company s million credit facility in august interest on outstanding borrowings is payable at libor plus  which was an effective rate of at december  income tax benefit the company recognized an income tax benefit of million in this net benefit was a result of recognizing income tax expense of million  offset by a benefit resulting from the release of million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
mainly as a result of the restructuring  the company had operating loss carryforwards and other future deductible temporary differences that resulted in a net deferred tax asset of million at december  because of the recent history of operating losses  the uncertainty of projecting future taxable income sufficient to recognize these deferred tax assets  and management s belief that the company had to establish a track record of returning to sustained profitability  a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset was recorded at that time 
in the third quarter of  million of deferred income tax liability arising from fair value adjustments in purchase accounting related to the acquisition of galt were recorded as a reduction of the allowance for the net deferred tax asset and a reduction in the goodwill arising from the transaction 
also during  the company determined it was more likely than not that a significant portion of these deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released million of the valuation allowance 
factors considered by management in determining that the significant portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized included  among other things  the company s performance for the year which included four consecutive quarters of profitability  a full fiscal year of realization of the cost savings associated with the restructuring which exceeded the expected cost savings  certain changes in federal laws and policies occurring in december related to medicare reimbursement of brachytherapy seeds  and the continued successful diversification of the company s business through its surgical products segment 
ii critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to its consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the accounting policies described below are those which we believe are most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
the significant accounting policies  which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  include the following property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company s estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the significant portion of equipment is comprised of the company s cyclotrons  utilized in the brachytherapy business 
as of december   the company owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in in december the company changed the estimated service lives of certain depreciable assets  mainly the cyclotron equipment 
the estimated service life of the cyclotron equipment was increased from years to years  and was based on  among other things  an assessment of the equipment s operating and maintenance history and expected future performance 
the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate in accordance with statement of financial accounting sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
accordingly  this change was accounted for in the period of the change and will be accounted for in future periods 
the effect of this change was not significant in in  this change is expected to reduce depreciation expense by approximately million 
management will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if the company determines that the useful life of property or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful lives of the identified assets 
management assesses the impairment of its depreciable assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
during the third quarter of the company recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to the psp facility  the newton terrace facility  six cyclotrons and other related long lived assets 
this impairment charge reflects the excess of these assets carrying value over their fair value as a result of the restructuring actions taken during the third quarter of see restructuring above 
additionally  the company wrote down the carrying value of its oak ridge facility by  in this facility has been shut down and held for sale since august the reduction in the carrying value was based upon the length of time the facility has been for sale  the general deterioration of the commercial real estate markets and recent signs of weakness in the overall economy in the united states 
it is possible that management s estimates concerning the realizability of the company s depreciable assets or assets held for sale could change in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has million of goodwill associated with its surgical products business and million of goodwill associated with its brachytherapy business 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
ii the company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter 
management also makes judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of income in future reporting periods that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  management typically makes various assumptions about the future prospects for the reporting unit that the asset relates to  considers market factors specific to that reporting unit and estimates future cash flows to be generated by that reporting unit 
assumptions used in these assessments are consistent with the company s internal planning 
the most recent assessment was performed in the fourth quarter of and the company determined that goodwill was not impaired 
other intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using a method that is expected to reflect the pattern of its economic benefit 
when a pattern of economic benefit cannot be determined  or if the straight line method results in greater amortization  then the straight line method is used 
to date  all finite lived intangible assets have been amortized using the straight line method 
the company also reviews finite lived intangible assets for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible or subject to return 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  management analyzes accounts receivable in relation to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment history  and changes in sales returns history in establishing this allowance 
it is possible that these or other underlying factors could change and impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
asset retirement obligation 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires the company to estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  to discount that cost to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in its consolidated balance sheet 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future decommissioning costs  inflation  cost of capital  and market risk premiums 
the nature of these estimates requires management to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
share based compensation 
the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we utilize the black scholes model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the company s expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the company s stock 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
ii the grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units collectively  the stock units are based on the fair value of the underlying common stock and is recognized over the requisite service period 
for stock units containing performance conditions  the grant date fair value is adjusted each period for the number of shares ultimately expected to be issued 
for stock units subject to discretionary performance conditions  the grant date has not been established and accordingly  the fair value of the award is updated each period for changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock 
to the extent that the underlying fair value of the company s common stock varies significantly  and or the number of shares issuable is determined  the company may record additional compensation expense or adjust previously recognized compensation expense 
accounting for income taxes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our tax provision and our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could differ materially from our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the company s deferred tax assets and recognizes the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that they are realizable 
at such time  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance is adjusted 
in  a million net deferred tax asset arose primarily as a result of the existence of operating losses and other deductible temporary differences related to the company s restructuring 
at that time  a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset was established due to uncertainties surrounding its realizability 
in the third quarter of  million of deferred income tax liabilities arising from fair value adjustments in purchase accounting related to the acquisition of galt were recorded as a reduction of the allowance 
also during  the company determined it was more likely than not that a significant portion of these deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released million of the valuation allowance 
factors considered by management in determining that the significant portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized included  among other things  the company s performance for the year which included four consecutive quarters of profitability  a full fiscal year of realization of the cost savings associated with the restructuring which exceeded the expected cost savings  certain changes in federal laws and policies occurring in december related to medicare reimbursement of brachytherapy seeds  and the continued successful diversification of the company s business through its surgical products segment 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
in the future if  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the company s ability to generate adequate future taxable income  it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the valuation allowance may be required to be increased 
ii commitments and other contractual obligations contractual obligations the company leases equipment and production  warehouse  office and other space under non cancelable leases that expire at various dates through june the company also has million of borrowings outstanding under its credit agreement 
approximate minimum payments of these obligations are as follows amounts in thousands obligation less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations rental space and equipment production  office and warehouse space related party total operating lease obligations long term debt interest on long term debt total long term debt other long term obligations total the surgical products business leases production  warehouse and office space from an entity controlled by the former owner of cp medical  who is currently an officer and stockholder of theragenics 
monthly payments of approximately  are due under this lease through april outstanding borrowings under the company s million credit facility are due october  interest on outstanding borrowings under credit facility at the december  effective rate of contract termination liability a contract termination liability of  including  classified as short term included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december   consists of the present value of future payments due under the company s oak ridge land lease  using a discount rate of 
this represents a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred through the remaining term of that lease agreement without economic benefit to the company  measured at its fair value when the company ceased using its oak ridge facility in august  and recorded in connection with the company s restructuring

ii medicare developments the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  which went into effect on january   contained brachytherapy provisions requiring medicare to reimburse hospital outpatient departments for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
the act also directed the us government accountability office gao to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the gao published its report on july   concluding that the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  the regulatory body that sets medicare reimbursement policies  could establish separate prospective payment rates effective in for palladium brachytherapy seeds sources such as theraseed and iodine seeds sources using medicare s hospital outpatient data 
although subsequently superceded by congress  cms posted a final rule on november  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds for medicare s hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps that would have applied to calendar year the use of prospective payment rates would have fixed the per seed rate at which medicare would have been reimbursed hospitals in the company believed that cms approach to determining the fixed prospective reimbursement rate for brachytherapy seeds was fundamentally flawed 
for example  cms did not stratify cost data on differing seed configurations  such as loose versus stranded seeds 
accordingly  the company continued to work with policy makers in an effort to rectify the shortcomings it believed to be contained in the new cms rule 
in december  congress enacted the tax relief and health care act of the act  which extended and refined the medicare safeguards initially enacted by congress in for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting 
the act s provisions on brachytherapy superceded the final rule published by cms on november  by extending the existing charges adjusted to cost reimbursement policies which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology for brachytherapy seeds through the end of  ensuring that the medicare program would not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during that period 
in addition  the legislation recognized that prostate cancer patients must have meaningful access to stranded brachytherapy seeds  which increasingly are used in clinical practice to further enhance the safety and efficacy of treatment 
the act also established a permanent requirement for medicare to use separate codes for the reimbursement of stranded brachytherapy devices 
stranded seeds are becoming a larger portion of theragenics brachytherapy business 
effective july  cms issued new reimbursement codes for brachytherapy sources 
the codes are isotope specific and recognize the distinction between nonstranded versus stranded seeds  as mandated by the act 
in early november  cms again posted a final opps rule for calendar year with fixed prospective reimbursement rates for all brachytherapy source new codes  including the new codes established in july in december  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of the act  which once again superseded another cms final opps rule by extending the existing pass through reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds through june  fixed reimbursement rates would have been scheduled to become effective on january  without the enactment of the act 
under the current law  fixed reimbursement rates for seeds will be implemented in july this and other factors can be expected to lead to continued pricing pressure from hospitals and other health care providers 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
the company intends to continue to pursue delays in implementation of fixed reimbursement
