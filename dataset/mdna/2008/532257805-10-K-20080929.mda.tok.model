joint venture on january   we entered into a joint venture contract with cdgm glass co  ltd 
cdgm 
it was intended that lightpath and cdgm would each own a interest in a joint venture which would be organized under the name lightpath cdgm chengdu optical co  ltd 
and located in chengdu  china 
the initial business purpose of the joint venture was to develop  mold  and manufacture aspheric lenses with a diameter of less than mm for high volume visible imaging applications for cell phones  digital cameras and video equipment as well as assemble modules that will include the lenses for such applications 
it was intended that the joint venture would sell and distribute its products in china and international markets and would provide technical and after sale services 
the target production volume of the joint venture was one million lenses per month  which the parties believed could have been achieved after months of manufacturing operations 
the joint venture was contingent on  among other things  the contribution of  of initial funding from each of the two joint venturers 
because we were unable to raise the funds necessary to make the initial capital contribution  cdgm and we have terminated the joint venture contract on september  in the absence of the joint venture  lightpath will continue its strategy to enter into the imaging lens market using its existing capacity at its shanghai facility but on a significantly lesser scale 
subsequent event on august   we executed a securities purchase agreement with twenty four institutional and private investors with respect to a private placement of senior convertible debentures the debentures 
the sale of the debentures generated gross proceeds of approximately  we will use the funds to provide working capital for its operations 
among the investors were steven brueck  j 
james gaynor  louis leeburg  robert ripp  gary silverman and james magos  all of whom were directors or officers of lightpath as of august  mr 
magos resigned effective september  the maturity date of the debentures is august   on which date the outstanding principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued but unpaid interest will be due 
interest on the debentures is payable quarterly commencing on october  and may be paid in cash or our common stock 
the interest due on october  was prepaid by the company on august  by issuing  shares of common stock in payment of such interest 
the debentures are secured by substantially all of our previously unencumbered assets pursuant to a security agreement and are guarantied by our wholly owned subsidiaries  geltech inc and lightpath optical instrumentation shanghai  ltd 
pursuant to a subsidiary guarantee 
the debentures are immediately convertible into  shares of common stock  based on a conversion price of per share  which is of the closing bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  investors also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of the our common stock the warrants 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on august  with of the warrants  exercisable for  shares  priced at per share and the remaining of the warrants priced at per share 
if all of the warrants were exercised  we would receive additional proceeds in the amount of  investors who participated in our july common stock private placement equity were offered an incentive to invest in the current offering 
four investors from the july offering participated in the current offering and as a result we reduced the exercise price of the warrants they received in the july offering from per share to per share 
additionally  such investors were issued an aggregate of  incentive common shares the incentive shares 
we have agreed to pay a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering  first montauk securities corp  in an amount equal to  plus costs and expenses 
we also issued to first montauk and its designees warrants to purchase an 
table of contents aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  which is of the closing bid price of the our common stock on the nasdaq capital market on july  in addition  the exercise price of of the warrants issued to the first montauk and its designees at the closing of the july financing was reduced to per share 
the private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the act  pursuant to section of the act in that we sold the debentures and warrants in a transaction not involving any public offering and pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
none of the shares into which the debentures are convertible  the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants or the incentive shares have been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration 
we have agreed to cause the shares to be issued upon conversion of the debentures and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and the incentive shares to be registered for resale with the securities and exchange commission 
we and the investors executed a registration rights agreement dated august   pursuant to which we have undertaken the obligation to file with the securities and exchange commission  and to cause to be declared effective  a registration statement to register the shares into which the debentures are convertible  the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and the incentive shares 
liquidity and capital resources history from february when our ipo occurred through fiscal  inclusive  we raised a net total of approximately million from the issuance of common and preferred stock  the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our capital stock 
we did not have any equity or debt financing transactions in fiscal  however in fiscal   and we raised approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in private placements 
our optical product markets experienced a severe downturn beginning fiscal  which continued through fiscal and resulted in a significant decline in the demand for our products over that period 
beginning in and continuing through fiscal  we believe that some improvement occurred in demand for our products in several of our markets 
nevertheless  we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during fiscal and we have developed our operating plan for fiscal and forecasted revenues and cash flows 
we believe we currently have adequate financial resources for implementation and achievement of our fiscal operating plan and to sustain operations as currently conducted in the coming year 
the cost savings generated in fiscal due to the reduced rent obligations on the facility in orlando and the salary reductions in orlando will continue through fiscal going concern and management s plans the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
because of recurring operating losses during and of million and million  respectively  and cash used in operations during and of million and million  respectively  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our continuation as a going concern is dependent on attaining profitable operations through achieving revenue growth targets 
we have instituted a cost reduction program and have reduced headcount in orlando and costs for medical insurance for our employees 
in addition  we have redesigned certain product lines  increased sales prices on certain items  obtained more favorable material costs  and have instituted more efficient management techniques 
we believe these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability assuming we meet out sales targets 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
we have developed an operating plan for fiscal and we believe we have adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan and to sustain our current operations in the coming year 
nevertheless  we will be monitoring the plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year  remedial actions will be initiated 
we had a cash balance of approximately  at june  in august  we raised approximately million from the sale of convertible debentures and warrants 
we may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable  however  we may be required to seek external financing regardless of whether the terms would otherwise be acceptable if our financial resources are not sufficient to sustain its operations or to pursue its business plan 
there can be no assurance that any external financing will be available when we may need it 

table of contents the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate sales growth primarily in the infrared products and the low cost high volume products for the imaging markets in asia  which are new markets for us 
we expect margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs as a result of the shifting of our manufacturing operations to shanghai  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
however  there is no assurance we will be able to achieve the necessary sales growth and gross margin improvements to sustain operations 
factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include  but are not limited to  a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth  increased material costs  increased labor costs  planned production efficiency improvements not being realized  increases in property  casualty  benefit and liability insurance premiums and increases in other discretionary spending  particularly sales and marketing related 
cash flows cash used by operations during fiscal was approximately million  an increase of approximately million from fiscal during the course of fiscal  we incurred expenses of approximately million  caused by glass yield issues  overtime for direct labor  legal expenses for the harborview litigation  severance and executive search fees for our ceo  travel for engineering and management to resolve issues at our shanghai facility  and freight and duty expenses 
we do not anticipate these types of expenses to continue at this level in fiscal we anticipate lower glass costs by replacing an internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes which are expected to improve our cash flow in future years 
while progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow since fiscal  significant risk and uncertainty remains 
our cash used by operations was approximately  for the fourth quarter of fiscal cost cutting measures were implemented in fiscal but revenues were not high enough to cover fixed costs 
the fiscal operating plan and related financial projections which we have developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs  offset by marginal increases in selling  administrative and new product development expenditures 
during fiscal  we expended approximately  for capital equipment in comparison to  during fiscal the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity or for tenant improvements due to the reduction in space at our orlando facility 
the majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity 
our operating plan for fiscal estimates expenditures at lower levels to enhance or expand our capacity  however  we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances 
in july  we raised gross proceeds of approximately  by way of the sale of newly issued common stock and warrants to certain institutional and private investors 
on september   we received a letter from one of the investors that purchased  of common stock issued in the offering  demanding rescission of its investment and reimbursement of the investor for its expenses incurred in connection with transaction 
the demand was based on the investor s allegations that we failed to disclose facts material to the investor in making its investment decision for example  alleged omissions relating to the termination of the employment of kenneth j 
brizel  our then chief executive officer and our financial condition  and breached certain representations and warranties set forth in the securities purchase agreement executed with respect to the transaction 
we believe there is no merit to the investor s claims and responded to the investor rejecting the demand 
on october   we were served with a complaint filed by the investor against the company  mr 
brizel  and mr 
ripp  our chairman  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
in the complaint  the investor is seeking  among other things  rescission of its purchase and the return of its  investment  as well as reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with its investment 
on january   after we filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint  the investor filed an amended complaint making substantially the same allegations and seeking the same relief 
on march   we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety  and that motion is currently pending 
we believe there is no merit to the investor s claims and intends to vigorously defend against this litigation 
on may   we entered into a receivables purchase and security agreement with lsq funding group  lc 
lsq 
the agreement provided a  revolving line of credit  with all accounts receivable invoices serving as collateral 
certain domestic customers were identified to participate in this program 
the agreement was for a six month term  with an option to renew for additional six month periods which we will not exercise 
as of june  the loan balance to lsq was  we presented accounts receivable invoices and received of the invoice balance immediately 
interest was set at prime plus two percent 
a discount fee was charged upon the funding of each invoice 
invoices sold to lsq which remain outstanding over ninety days past the due date are required to be re purchased 
once amounts due under a sold invoice are paid to lsq the balance after retention by lsq of amounts funds by lsq for such invoice is transferred to us 
we have delivered notice to lsq that the agreement will not be renewed and  therefore  it will expire on november  no termination fee is payable to lsq as the minimum funding required in the agreement has been met 

table of contents key performance indicators how we operate we have continuing sales of two basic types occasional sales via ad hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations our turns business and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development 
in this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them  including complex multi component designs that we call engineered assemblies 
that is followed by sampling them small numbers of the product for their test and evaluation 
thereafter  should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need  we negotiate and win a contract sometimes called a design win whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement 
the strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business  which is unpredictable and uneven 
a key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible 
we have several challenges in doing so maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability  including a high quality and responsive optical design engineering staff  the fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume  commercial production for example  in the case of molded optics  this may be volumes over one million pieces per year they begin to work seriously to reduce costs which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers  even if sacrificing quality  and our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures in other words  because of our limited cash resources and cash flow  we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures 
despite these challenges to winning more annuity business  we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market  a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering 
additionally  we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the united states should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources 
we also continue to have the proprietary gradium lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets 
our key indicators usually on a weekly basis  management reviews a number of performance indicators 
some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative 
these indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change 
they are mostly non financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line  production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product 
these indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per shift  which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time 
higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications 
the data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes 
we believe that our non financial production indicators  such as those noted  are proprietary information 
financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro level business cycle sales backlog  inventory levels  and accounts receivable levels and quality 
these indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below 
sales backlog sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success 
our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our order book 
our order book equates to sales backlog 
it has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect quantitatively  our backlog s prospective dollar value and qualitatively  what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date certain delivery 
we define our disclosure backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues 
this includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria 
generally  higher backlog is better for us 

table of contents disclosure backlog  as defined above  has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended approximate disclosure backlog q  q  q  q  q  q  our disclosure backlog at june  was million 
due to market conditions  throughout fiscal new communications orders were lower from the previous year 
we believe the upward trend in the disclosure backlog was principally caused by our new focus on the imaging market 
inventory levels we manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree 
while the mix of inventory is an important factor  including adequate safety stocks of long lead time materials  an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter s ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s cost of sales  also known as days cost of sales in inventory  or dcsi 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending inventory by the quarter s cost of goods sold  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dcsi measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dcsi for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dcsi days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average in comparison  our days cost of sales in inventory at june  was  comparing to at june  we believe this downward trend in inventory was principally caused by the standard cost reevaluation in december reflecting our lower costs due to manufacturing in china 
we expect inventory levels to decline through fiscal as we continue to reduce costs 
accounts receivable levels and quality similarly  we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital 
we measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms  which are generally days 
the most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days worth of the quarter s net revenues  also known as days sales outstanding  or dso 
it is calculated by dividing the quarter s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter s net revenues  multiplied by and divided by generally  a lower dso measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital 
the table below shows our dso for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters fiscal quarter ended dso days q q q q fiscal average q q q q fiscal average 
table of contents our days sales outstanding at june  was  compared to at june  we plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible and strive to have it no higher than we have noticed an increase in dso as more of our revenues are from international customers who tend to take longer to pay 
year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated operations our consolidated revenues totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or compared to revenues for fiscal of million 
the decrease was attributable to decreases in sales of aspheric lenses  collimators and isolators product sales 
sales to our telecommunication customers were down million from fiscal in our operating plan for fiscal we expect to see continued revenue gains in aspheric lenses while collimators and isolator sales are expected to remain at current levels 
fiscal consolidated cost of sales of million was approximately of net revenues of million  which is an increase over fiscal when our cost of sales was approximately of net revenues 
this percentage increase was caused by several factors 
among them  lower revenues were not sufficient to absorb our fixed costs and overhead costs 
our two plants were at capacity for fiscal our plant capacity and overhead structure are sufficient to handle much higher levels of production 
during the year we were successful in shifting a higher percentage of production of molded optics to china  reducing materials cost by incorporating lower cost glass into our products and manufacturing lens holders in house at a reduced cost  all of which we anticipate will result in continued improvements to our margins 
these cost reductions have lowered our cost structure and enabled us to bid on the high volume low cost business 
going forward into fiscal  the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and more sourcing in china of raw materials and coating services and higher yields due to a more experienced workforce in shanghai 
over the course of fiscal  as our manufacturing has shifted to asia  we reduced our headcount in orlando from down to as of june   of our precision molded optics production has been transferred to china 
this line comprises of our total revenue and with the majority of the manufacturing now in china our gross margin will continue to improve as we have not yet seen the full year impact of this transfer 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased stock compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock issued in october  legal costs for the harborview litigation and severance and search fees related to the replacement of our ceo 
during fiscal we have reduced expenses through a voluntary reduction in executive and board compensation 
our operating plan for fiscal projects business levels that will require selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease  primarily caused by a reduction in our workforce in orlando 
our intent is to manage the orlando workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals 
new product development costs in fiscal increased by approximately  to approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to increased materials cost and labor for our china engineering staff 
our operating plan for fiscal projects some increases in new product development spending in order to support increased quote and customer design activity as well as continued investment in new projects 
in fiscal our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately  and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal interest expense increased by approximately  to approximately  compared to approximately  in fiscal this is primarily due to factoring fees offset by lower loan balances due to payments made on loans 
other income decreased by approximately  to approximately  from approximately  of income in fiscal  due to a decrease in interest earned on lower cash balances 
net loss for fiscal was approximately million compared with approximately million in fiscal  a decline of approximately million 
this decline in the current year was comprised principally of gross margin reduction of million  
table of contents stock compensation expense increases of  severance and search fees related to the replacement of our ceo of increased legal fees of  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented 
our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts  inventory reserves  revenue recognition and valuation of compensation expense on stock based awards 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors  and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our critical and significant accounting policies are described in note of our financial statements in item the critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows allowance for accounts receivable  is calculated by taking of the total of invoices that are over past due from due date and of the total of invoices that are over past due from due date 
inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished lenses  isolators  collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
inventory costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we have applied statement of financial accounting standards no 
inventory costs fas to our value of inventory 
fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period not capatilizied into inventory 
also unusual or abnormal costs  primarily relating to the start up of the china facility have been expensed 
the inventory obsolensce reserve is calculated by reserving for items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply 
we also reserve for slow moving items within the last months and for low material usage in the last six months 
deferred rent 
certain of the company s operating leases contain predetermined fixed increases of the base rental rate during the lease term 
for these leases  the company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the company has recorded the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts payable under the leases as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue is recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer  provided that the company has received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products  reports or designs to the customer 
sales to santur were approximately  and million  which represents and of net revenues for the years ended june  and  respectively 
sales to t networks were approximately zero for fiscal and million  which represents of net revenues for the year ended june  during fiscal intel moved their production to a subcontractor which is a customer of ours 
the aggregate sales of the subcontractor and intel are approximately of revenues 
stock based compensation is expensed according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the company elected to use the modified prospective method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted shares beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
for all unvested options outstanding as of july   and subsequently granted options  the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value at the original grant date  will be recognized on a straight line basis in the consolidated statements of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option as of the date of grant 
we use the black scholes pricing model 
most options granted under our amended and restated omnibus incentive plan vest ratably over two to four years and generally have ten year contract lives 
the volatility rate is based on four year historical trends in common stock closing prices and the expected term was calculated using the simplified method 
the interest rate used is the us treasury interest rate for constant maturities 
the likelihood of meeting targets for option grants that are performance based are evaluated each quarter 
if it is determined that meeting the targets is likely then the compensation expense will be amortized over the remaining vesting period
