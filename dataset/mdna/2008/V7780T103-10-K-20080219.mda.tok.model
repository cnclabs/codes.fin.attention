item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a note regarding forward looking statements 
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 
we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators  which provide other leisure options including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines  both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to passengers 
our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation plc  which owns  among others  carnival cruise lines  princess cruises  costa cruises  holland america line  p o cruises  cunard line and aida cruises  star cruises  ncl corporation ltd  which owns  among others  norwegian cruise line  mediterranean shipping company  which owns msc cruises  disney cruise line  and oceania cruises 
in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry  a reduction in demand or geo political and economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on revenues  result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect our results of operations 
cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase further as the major cruise vacation companies introduce new ships 
demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on the strength of the economies in the countries in which we market our products  the public s attitude towards the safety of travel and the geo political climate 
economic or political changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy and or price discounting 
for instance  the current weakening of the us economy and the tighter credit markets could have an adverse effect on vacationers discretionary income and consumer confidence  which could result in a lower demand for cruises  lower cruise prices and lower onboard revenues  all of which would adversely affect our revenues 
in turn  these results could have a negative impact on revenues  result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
fears of terrorist attacks  war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
events such as terrorist attacks  war and other hostilities and the resulting political instability  travel restrictions  the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety  health and security aspects of traveling have had  and could have in the future  a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry 
these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and  therefore  increase our shipboard employee costs 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations 
the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents  illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance 
incidents involving cruise ships  adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
environmental  health and safety  financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 
the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry 
some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
in addition  we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards on board our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
in november  the us customs and border protection cbp proposed an interpretive rule to the united states passenger vessel services act pvsa which would require that all roundtrip us cruises by foreign flag vessels spend at least hours in each foreign port of the cruise and that the time spent in foreign ports must be more than of the time spent in all us ports on the cruise 
we believe that the cbp issued the proposed rule to protect norwegian cruise line s operations in hawaii by making it more difficult for foreign flagged ships to conduct cruises going to hawaii 
however  if the rule is adopted as proposed  it could be construed to apply to other non hawaii itineraries such as seattle based alaska and some caribbean cruises  which may no longer qualify under the pvsa 
if this was to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations 
to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  we rely on a combination of cash flows provided by operations  drawdowns under our available credit facilities  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets 
our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain financing in financial markets and the terms of the financing 
any lowering of our credit ratings may have adverse consequences on our ability to access the financial markets and or on our cost of financings 
in addition  interest rates and our ability to obtain financing are dependent on many economic and political factors beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that our cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in accordance with our expectations 
conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 
we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence 
operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks 
examples include political risks and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising  vacation or maritime businesses  or governing the operations of foreign based companies 
additional risks include currency fluctuations  interest rate movements  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we are unable to address these risks adequately  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have ship construction contracts  which are denominated in euros 
while we have entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts  we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged 
if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract  any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated 
termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 
ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order 
the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks 
delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships 
we have  for example  experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future 
delays or cancellations of cruise ships may also adversely impact our ability to maintain our contractual minimum commitments to our ports 
these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue  increased operating expenses  or both  and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
shipyard financial difficulties or insolvencies  shortages in available shipbuilding facilities and component parts due to strong demand for shipbuilding services within the industry  and industry consolidations may cause delivery delays or price increases that could adversely affect our results of operations 
conditions in the shipyard industry over which we have no control can affect our financial results 
for example  we regularly introduce new ships to our fleet  and regularly repair and refurbish our existing fleet 
the timely delivery of new ships and our ability to repair and refurbish our fleet can be adversely affected by factors such as shipyard financial difficulties  shortages in shipbuilding component parts and capacity constraints at qualified shipyard repair facilities 
delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations  as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 
in addition  the cruise shipyard industry is undergoing consolidation  which could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards  and thus higher prices for our ships 
aker yards oy  the shipyard that is building independence of the seas and our two project genesis class ships  announced a lowering of its projected profits and delays in the construction of its vessels 
we have engaged in discussions with aker yards oy to assess the impact of this situation on the ships they are building for us 
based on such discussions  we do not expect that this situation will have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  in the event that the financial situation of aker yards oy deteriorates further  it could have a material impact on the delivery and costs associated with our project genesis class ships and our future results of operations 
our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or political factors beyond our control 
our operating costs  including fuel  food  payroll  insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control 
increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes 
the implementation of these and other taxes could also cause an increase in our costs 
the office of the attorney general for the state of florida is conducting a review of our temporary fuel supplement that we implemented in the fourth quarter of on our royal caribbean international  celebrity cruises  and azamara cruises brands 
we are cooperating with the attorney general s office in connection with this review and investigation 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact of this item on our consolidated financial statements 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors  local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 
price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests 
many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark 
increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests which may adversely impact demand for our cruises 
in addition  changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our ability to fly our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 
a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code  or other jurisdictions  may have adverse effects on our income 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business and or from sources within the united states 
drinker biddle reath llp  our united states tax counsel  has delivered to us an opinion  based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it  to the effect that this income  to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships  is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 
in  final regulations under section became effective  which narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships 
to the extent the income from non incidental activities is earned from sources within the united states  that income will be subject to united states taxation  but the determination of the precise amount of such united states source income involves some uncertainties 
it should also be noted that the provisions of section are subject to change at any time by legislation 
moreover  changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity  residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders that could affect our eligibility for the section exemption 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future 
if we were not entitled to the benefit of section  we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships  which would reduce our net income 
see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section finally  changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in malta  the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our operations  resulting in lower net income 
we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies  management and actions requiring shareholder approval 
as of february   a 
wilhelmsen as  a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway  owned approximately of our common stock and cruise associates  a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family  owned approximately of our common stock 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates have the power to determine  among other things our policies and the policies of our subsidiaries  the persons who will be our directors and officers  and actions requiring shareholder approval 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders agreement 
the agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of the following persons four nominees of a 
wilhelmsen as  four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer 
during the term of the shareholders agreement  certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a 
wilhelmsen as 
and one director nominated by cruise associates 
our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business  subject to certain exceptions 
if any person other than a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates  our two principal shareholders  acquires ownership of more than of our common stock and our two principal shareholders  in the aggregate  own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect  or to designate for election  at least a majority of the board of directors  we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities  which we may be unable to replace on similar terms 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
the holders of our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their equity interest as a result of the sale of currently restricted shares of our common stock into the public market 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock were either issued by us in private transactions not involving a public offering or are held by our affiliates and  therefore the sale of these securities is subject to restrictions under the securities act of securities act 
these shares include the shares of our common stock held by a 
wilhelmsen as 
and the held by cruise associates 
no predictions can be made as to the effect  if any  that market sales of such shares  or the availability of such shares for future market sales  will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perceptions that such sales could occur  could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
each of a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates has the right  pursuant to a registration rights agreement  to require us  subject to certain qualifications  to effect the registration under the securities act of all or part of their shares of common stock which would allow these shares to be sold into the public market 
we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 
our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and by laws and by the business corporation act of liberia 
the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states 
however  while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes  there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia 
for example  the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions 
thus  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management  directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 
litigation  enforcement actions  fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and or damage our reputation 
our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions  fines  civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages 
in addition  improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines 
in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and or a legal strategy my not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter 
such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations
