item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview financial federal corporation is an independent financial services company operating in the united states through three wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries  partnerships or joint ventures 
we also do not have any off balance sheet assets or liabilities other than commitments to extend credit  goodwill  other intangible assets or pension obligations  and we are not involved in income tax shelters 
we have one fully consolidated special purpose entity we established for our on balance sheet asset securitization facility 
we have one line of business 
we lend money under installment sale agreements  secured loans and leases collectively referred to as finance receivables to small and medium sized businesses for their equipment financing needs 
finance receivable transactions generally range between  and million  have terms between two and five years and provide for monthly payments 
the average transaction size is approximately  we earn revenue solely from interest and other fees and amounts earned on our finance receivables 
we need to borrow most of the money we lend 
therefore  liquidity money currently available for us to borrow is very important 
we borrow from banks and insurance companies and we issue commercial paper to other investors 
approximately of our finance receivables were funded with debt at july  our main areas of focus are i asset quality ii liquidity iii net interest spread the difference between the rates we earn on our receivables and the rates we incur on our debt and iv interest rate risk 
changes in the asset quality of our finance receivables can affect our profitability significantly 
finance income  provisions for credit losses and operating expenses can be affected by reclassifying receivables to or from impaired status  incurring write downs and incurring costs associated with non performing assets 
changes in market interest rates can also affect our profitability significantly because interest rates on our finance receivables were fixed and floating  and interest rates on our debt were fixed and floating at july  we use various strategies to manage our credit risk and interest rate risk 
each of these four areas is integral to our long term profitability and we discuss them in detail in separate sections of this discussion 
our key operating statistics are net charge offs  loss ratio  non performing assets  delinquencies  receivables growth  leverage  available liquidity  return on equity  net interest margin and net interest spread  and expense and efficiency ratios 
significant events a crisis began in credit markets in august the beginning of fiscal and continued to disrupt a wider range of financing sources during the fiscal year 
the crisis made it increasingly difficult and significantly more expensive through higher credit spreads for finance companies to obtain and renew financing 
credit spread is the percentage amount lenders charge borrowers above a base market interest rate 
credit spreads on term debt rose to their highest levels in over five years  the asset backed securitization market contracted and banks curbed their lending because of the crisis 
these are our main sources of funding 
our cost of debt will increase as we obtain new financing if higher credit spreads persist 
our liquidity and funding sources are discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
the crisis is generally believed to have been caused by problems originating in subprime mortgage markets 
we do not provide subprime mortgage financing 
the federal reserve responded to the crisis by adding significant liquidity to the credit markets at more favorable terms and by lowering its target federal funds rate seven times by a total of basis points 
these were the first decreases in over four years and the largest decreases since this lowered the interest rates on our floating rate debt and reduced our interest expense as discussed in the market interest risk and sensitivity section 
the credit crisis caused decreased demand for and higher credit spreads on commercial paper 
as a result  our commercial paper outstanding decreased from million to a low of million during fiscal we also decreased borrowings under our asset securitization facility from million to a low of million during fiscal because of higher credit spreads 
we were able to reduce our debt from these funding sources because we had over million available to borrow under our committed unsecured revolving bank credit facilities 
we estimate this reduced our fiscal interest expense by million 
the commercial paper and securitization markets are not expected to return to their pre crisis state for some time 
during this difficult environment  we partially renewed our million asset securitization facility in april the asset securitization market was among the most affected by the credit crisis  but we were able to increase the initial amount available to borrow to million from million 
two of the four banks in the facility increased their combined commitment by million and the other two banks did not renew their commitments because of the credit crisis 
therefore  we converted the million borrowed from them into amortizing term debt 
the securitization facility is discussed further in the liquidity and capital resources section 
having a significant amount of unused committed bank credit facilities without any borrowing restrictions allowed us to fund our operations without being disrupted during the ongoing credit crisis and mitigated the effects of higher interest rates on other short term borrowings 
we have always stressed the importance of having ample liquidity from diverse  reliable sources 
our available liquidity is at the highest level in our history 
the credit crisis has also caused many financial institutions to record significant write downs mostly on their residential mortgage related assets and structured investment vehicles and due to unsound lending practices 
we are not involved in these types of transactions and always understand the importance of proper underwriting 
therefore  the credit crisis has had less of an impact on us 
our asset quality and underwriting are discussed in the finance receivables and asset quality section 
critical accounting policies and estimates applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires judgment  assumptions and estimates to record the amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we describe the significant accounting policies and methods we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements in note accounting policies involving significant judgment  assumptions and estimates are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed below 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is our estimate of losses inherent in our finance receivables at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is difficult to determine and requires significant judgment 
the allowance is based on total finance receivables  net charge off experience  impaired and delinquent finance receivables and our current assessment of the risks inherent in our finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of customers and guarantors  collateral values and other factors 
we may need to change the allowance level significantly if unexpected changes in these conditions or factors occur 
increases in the allowance would reduce net income through higher provisions for credit losses 
we would need to record a million provision for each required increase in the allowance 
the allowance was million of finance receivables at july  including million specifically allocated to impaired receivables 
the allowance includes amounts specifically allocated to impaired receivables and an amount to provide for losses inherent in the remainder of finance receivables the general allowance 
we evaluate the fair values of impaired receivables and compare them to the carrying amounts 
the carrying amount is the amount receivables are recorded at when we evaluate them and may include prior write downs or a specific allowance 
if our fair value estimate is lower than the carrying amount  we record a write down or establish a specific allowance depending on i how we determined fair value ii how certain we are of our estimate and iii the level and type of factors and items other than the primary collateral supporting our fair value estimate  such as guarantees and secondary collateral 
to estimate the general allowance  we analyze historical write down activity to develop percentage loss ranges by risk profile 
risk profiles are assigned to receivables based on past due status and the customers industry 
we do not use a loan grading system 
we then adjust the calculated range of losses for expected recoveries and we may also adjust the range for differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors to arrive at the estimated allowance 
we record a provision for credit losses if the recorded allowance differs from our current estimate 
the adjusted calculated range of losses may differ from actual losses significantly because we use significant estimates 
non performing assets we record impaired finance receivables and repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables at their current estimated fair value if less than their carrying amount 
we estimate fair value of these non performing assets by evaluating the market value and condition of the collateral or assets and the expected cash flows of impaired receivables 
we evaluate market value based on recent sales of similar equipment  used equipment publications  our market knowledge and information from equipment vendors 
unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect estimates of expected cash flows  market value or the condition of collateral or assets  or time needed to sell equipment would require us to record a write down 
this would lower net income 
non performing assets totaled million of finance receivables at july  residual values we record residual values on direct financing leases at the lowest of i any stated purchase option ii the present value at the end of the initial lease term of rentals due under any renewal options or iii our projection of the equipment s fair value at the end of the lease 
we may not fully realize recorded residual values because of unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect projections of future equipment values 
this would lower net income 
residual values totaled million of finance receivables at july  historically  we have realized the recorded residual value on disposition 
income taxes we record a liability for uncertain income tax positions according to fin no 
fin no 
requires us to i identify uncertain tax positions we take on our income tax returns ii determine if these positions would more likely than not be allowed by a taxing authority and iii if tax positions pass this more likely than not test  estimate the amount of tax benefit to record 
therefore  we must record a liability for tax benefits from positions failing the test and from positions where the full amount of the tax benefits are not expected to be realized 
identifying uncertain tax positions  determining if they pass the test and determining the liability to record requires significant judgment because tax laws are complicated and subject to interpretation  and because fin no 
requires us to assess the outcome of hypothetical challenges to these positions by taxing authorities 
actual outcomes of these uncertain tax positions differing from our assessments significantly and taxing authorities examining positions we did not consider uncertain could require us to record additional income tax expense including interest and penalties on any underpayment of tax 
this would lower net income 
the gross liability recorded for uncertain tax positions was million on july  and we do not expect this amount to change significantly 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense for stock options under sfas no 
r using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires us to estimate the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  the expected life of options and the expected dividend rate 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate forfeitures of stock awards 
estimating volatility  expected life  dividend rate and forfeitures requires significant judgment and an analysis of historical data 
we may have to increase compensation expense for stock awards if actual results differ from our estimates significantly 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal years ended july  in millions  except per share amounts change change finance income interest expense net finance income before provision for credit losses provision for credit losses salaries and other expenses provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share net income was million in fiscal and because the net positive effects of lower short term market interest rates and the negative effects of higher non performing assets offset 
finance income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal because the net yield on finance receivables declined slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the basis point decrease in the prime rate and higher non accrual receivables caused the decline 
decreases in the prime rate lower the net yield because of our receivables are indexed to the prime rate 
the change in average receivables was not significant 
interest expense incurred on debt used to fund finance receivables decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal because our cost of debt declined to in fiscal from in fiscal lower short term market interest rates caused the decline because of our debt was indexed to short term market interest rates in fiscal this is discussed in the market interest rate risk and sensitivity section 
the change in average debt was not significant 
net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin net finance income before provision for credit losses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables increased to in fiscal from in fiscal because of lower short term market interest rates 
we recorded a million provision for credit losses on finance receivables in fiscal we did not record a provision in fiscal the provision for credit losses is the amount needed to change the allowance for credit losses to our estimate of losses inherent in finance receivables 
net charge offs write downs of finance receivables less recoveries increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal  and the loss ratio net charge offs expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables increased to in fiscal from less than in fiscal net charge offs have been increasing because of higher non performing assets 
the allowance and net charge offs are discussed further in the finance receivables and asset quality section 
salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from higher non performing asset costs and  to a lesser extent  salary increases 
the expense ratio salaries and other expenses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables worsened to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the increase in expenses 
the efficiency ratio expense ratio expressed as a percentage of net interest margin worsened to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in expenses exceeded the percentage increase in net finance income before provision for credit losses 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change was not significant because income before income taxes increased by million and our effective tax rate was in fiscal and diluted earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the percentage increases in diluted and basic earnings per share were higher than the percentage increase in net income because we repurchased million shares of our common stock in the last six fiscal quarters 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal years ended july  in millions  except per share amounts change change finance income interest expense net finance income before provision for credit losses provision for credit losses salaries and other expenses provision for income taxes net income diluted earnings per share basic earnings per share net income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from receivables growth and the higher net yield on finance receivables  partially offset by the effects of higher short term market interest rates 
finance income increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in average finance receivables million to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the higher net yield on finance receivables 
the net yield on finance receivables increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of higher market interest rates 
interest expense increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the million increase in average debt and higher short term market interest rates 
increases in short term market interest rates raised our cost of debt to in fiscal from in fiscal net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal we did not record provisions for credit losses on finance receivables in fiscal and we did not need to increase the allowance because of continued low net charge offs and continued strong asset quality  and we did not need to reduce it because of receivables growth 
net charge offs were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  and the loss ratio was less than in fiscal and fiscal salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from fewer recoveries of non performing asset costs and higher salaries 
the expense ratio improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in average receivables exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the efficiency ratio improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in net finance income before provision for credit losses exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in income before income taxes  partially offset by the decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased because of the new texas income tax law effective for fiscal and the overall decrease in our state effective income tax rate 
diluted earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the percentage increases in diluted and basic earnings per share were the same as the percentage increase in net income because the effect of repurchasing million shares in fiscal and the effect of stock option exercises offset 
finance receivables and asset quality we discuss trends and characteristics of our finance receivables and our approach to managing credit risk in this section 
the key aspect is asset quality 
asset quality statistics measure our underwriting standards  skills and policies and procedures and can indicate the direction of future net charge offs and non performing assets 
july  july  in millions change change finance receivables   allowance for credit losses non performing assets delinquent finance receivables net charge offs as a percentage of receivables allowance for credit losses non performing assets delinquent finance receivables net charge offs as of and for the year ended finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and direct financing leases 
loans were billion of finance receivables and leases were million at july  finance receivables decreased million or in fiscal because of lower originations and higher prepayments 
we originated million of finance receivables in fiscal and billion in fiscal originations decreased because of weak demand for construction and transportation equipment financing and because competitor banks have been offering terms we think are imprudent 
we collected billion of finance receivables in fiscal and billion in collections increased because of increased prepayment activity 
prepayments typically increase when market interest rates decline 
our primary focus is the credit quality of our receivables 
we manage our credit risk by adhering to disciplined and sound underwriting policies and procedures  by monitoring our receivables closely and by handling non performing accounts effectively 
our underwriting policies and procedures require a first lien on equipment financed 
we focus on financing equipment with a remaining useful life longer than the term financed  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in more than one type of business  ease of access and transporting  and broad  established resale markets 
securing our receivables with equipment possessing these characteristics can mitigate potential net charge offs 
we may also obtain additional equipment or other collateral  third party guarantees  advance payments or hold back a portion of the amount financed 
we do not finance or lease aircraft or railcars  computer related equipment  telecommunications equipment or equipment located outside the united states  and we do not lend to consumers 
our underwriting policies limit our credit exposure with any customer 
the limit was million at july  our ten largest customers accounted for million of total finance receivables at july  our allowance for credit losses increased to million at july  from million at july  and the allowance level increased to of finance receivables from 
the allowance is our estimate of losses inherent in our finance receivables 
we determine the allowance quarterly based on our analysis of historical losses and the past due status of receivables adjusted for expected recoveries and any differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors 
our estimates of inherent losses increased during fiscal because of higher net charge offs  delinquencies and non performing assets 
net charge offs of finance receivables write downs less recoveries were million in fiscal and  in fiscal and the loss ratios were and 
net charge offs have been increasing because the slowing economy  construction and transportation industries  and higher energy and commodity prices are reducing our customers cash flows and values of certain collateral 
the net investments in impaired finance receivables  repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables  total non performing assets and delinquent finance receivables transactions with more than a nominal portion of a contractual payment or more days past due follow in millions july  impaired finance receivables repossessed equipment total non performing assets delinquent finance receivables impaired receivables not delinquent before specifically allocated allowance of million at july  and million at july  we expect continued increases in delinquent and impaired receivables  repossessed equipment and net charge offs because of continued recessionary economic conditions  higher energy and commodity prices and the effects of the crisis in the credit markets 
this could require us to record higher provisions for credit losses 
our finance receivables contain industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations result from customers having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to repay us to be affected similarly by changes in economic or other conditions 
our industry concentrations were construction related  road transportation and refuse  and our us regional geographic concentrations were southwest  southeast  northeast  west and central at july  liquidity and capital resources we describe our need for raising capital debt and equity  our need to maintain a substantial amount of liquidity money currently available for us to borrow  our approach to managing liquidity and our current funding sources in this section 
key indicators are leverage the number of times debt exceeds equity  available liquidity  credit ratings and debt diversification 
our leverage is low for a finance company  we have been successful in issuing debt  we have ample liquidity available and our debt is diversified with maturities staggered over five years 
we believe our liquidity sources are diversified  and we are not dependent on any funding source or provider 
liquidity and access to capital are vital to our operations and growth 
we need continued availability of funds to originate or acquire finance receivables and to repay debt 
to ensure we have enough liquidity  we project our financing needs based on estimated receivables growth and maturing debt  we monitor capital markets closely  we diversify our funding sources and we stagger our debt maturities 
funding sources usually available to us include operating cash flow  private and public issuances of term debt  committed unsecured revolving bank credit facilities  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables  secured term financings  dealer placed and direct issued commercial paper and sales of common and preferred equity 
these funding sources may not be available to us currently or may only be available at unfavorable terms because of conditions in credit markets 
as discussed previously  the crisis in the credit markets has made it difficult and expensive for finance companies to obtain financing 
however  we do not anticipate needing new financing until the third quarter of fiscal because i we have million available to borrow under our committed revolving bank credit and asset securitization facilities after subtracting commercial paper outstanding at july  ii receivables originations have been decreasing iii our operating cash flow remains strong and iv we have no term notes maturing and only million of bank credit facilities expiring through the third quarter of fiscal in addition to the amortizing asset securitization debt 
we may need new financing before or in april if receivable originations increase or if holders of our million of convertible debentures exercise their put option as discussed later in this section 
although we do not need new financing currently  we continue to seek additional sources of financing actively to strengthen our liquidity beyond this period 
we believe sufficient  reasonably priced capital will be available to us to sustain our future operations and growth  even though conditions in credit markets have made financing difficult and more expensive to obtain  because of our consistent strong operating results and asset quality  and conservative capital structure of low leverage and high liquidity 
our term notes are rated bbb by fitch ratings  inc fitch  a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and our commercial paper is rated f by fitch 
fitch last affirmed these investment grade ratings in january and maintained its stable outlook 
as a condition of our f credit rating  commercial paper outstanding is limited to the unused amount of our committed credit facilities 
our ability to obtain or renew financing and our credit spreads can be dependent on these investment grade credit ratings 
our major operating subsidiary s debt agreements have restrictive covenants including limits on its indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to us  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
we have always complied with all debt covenants and restrictions 
none of the agreements have a material adverse change clause 
debt decreased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity increased by million to million at july  from million at july  therefore  leverage debt to equity ratio decreased to at july  from at july  our leverage is considered low allowing for substantial asset growth and equity repurchases 
historically  our leverage has not exceeded which is also considered low for a finance company 
debt comprised the following in millions july  july  amount percent amount percent term notes convertible debentures asset securitization borrowings term asset securitization borrowings revolving bank borrowings commercial paper total principal   fair value adjustment of hedged debt total debt   term notes the term notes were issued between fiscal and they are five and seven year fixed rate notes with principal due at maturity and interest payable semiannually 
maturity information for the notes is in the contractual obligations section 
we converted million of bank credit facilities scheduled to expire in february  march and january into five year fixed rate term notes in february interest is payable semiannually at a average rate and the notes are due at maturity in february we repaid million of fixed rate term notes swapped to floating rates at maturity in fiscal the average floating rate on these notes was 
we also repaid a million term note at maturity 
we repaid these notes with borrowings under our bank credit and securitization facilities 
convertible debentures we issued the convertible debentures in april they are due at maturity in april  but we can redeem call them anytime starting in april by repaying the principal amount in cash and debenture holders can require us to repurchase put them on each five year anniversary of issuance or when a specified corporate transaction occurs by paying the principal amount in cash 
debenture holders can also convert the debentures before maturity into cash and common stock as discussed below 
the debentures can only be converted i in a fiscal quarter when the closing price of our common stock is at least higher than the adjusted conversion price for at least of the last trading days of the prior fiscal quarter the market price condition ii if the debentures are rated bb or lower by fitch four levels lower than the current rating iii if we call the debentures or iv if a specified corporate transaction occurs 
no event allowing for the debentures to be converted has occurred through july  the market price condition would have been met at july  if the price of our common stock closed above for the required period 
the closing price of our common stock was on july  we irrevocably elected under the debentures original terms and without modifying the debentures in fiscal to pay the value of converted debentures  not exceeding their principal amount  in cash instead of issuing shares of our common stock 
the value of converted debentures equals the number of convertible shares multiplied by the market value of our common stock 
we would only issue shares if the value of converted debentures exceeded their principal amount 
shares of common stock needed to pay any value over principal would equal the difference between the conversion date closing price of our common stock and the conversion price  divided by the conversion date closing price and multiplied by the number of convertible shares 
there were million convertible but not issuable shares  the adjusted conversion price was per share and the adjusted conversion rate was shares for each  of principal at july  the conversion rate and number of convertible shares increase and the conversion price decreases when we declare dividends on our common stock 
asset securitization borrowings our asset securitization facility was partially renewed and partially converted into amortizing term debt in april the facility decreased to million from million and we converted million of borrowings into term debt 
the two renewing banks increased their commitments million each and we converted the amounts borrowed from the two non renewing banks into term debt 
we established the facility in july with one bank for million and this was the seventh renewal 
the facility provides for committed revolving financing through april and we can then convert borrowings outstanding into term debt if the facility is not renewed 
we are repaying the million of term debt monthly from collections of securitized receivables 
the repayments are based on securitized receivables and borrowings under the facility  and therefore vary 
the term debt would be substantially repaid in three years based on these amounts at july  finance receivables include million of securitized receivables at july  our major operating subsidiary s debt agreements limit securitized receivables to of its total receivables 
therefore  we could securitize an additional million of receivables at july  borrowings under the facility and the term debt combined are limited to of eligible securitized receivables 
securitized receivables or more days past due  classified as impaired or subject to a bankruptcy  or with terms outside of defined limits  are ineligible to be borrowed against 
the facility also restricts the amount of net charge offs of securitized receivables and the amount of delinquent securitized receivables 
the facility would terminate if these restrictions are exceeded  and borrowings outstanding would then be repaid monthly from collections of securitized receivables 
bank credit facilities we have million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from eleven banks 
this amount decreased from million at july  because we converted million of facilities into five year fixed rate term notes and a million facility expired 
the facilities range from million to million  and million of the facilities have original terms ranging from two to five years and a million facility has a one year original term 
borrowings under these facilities can mature between and days 
borrowings outstanding at july  matured on august   were reborrowed and remain outstanding 
we borrow amounts usually for one day  and also for one week or one month depending on interest rates  and roll the borrowings over when they mature depending on whether we issue or repay other debt 
the multi year facilities expire as follows in millions fiscal these committed facilities are a low cost source of funds and support our commercial paper program 
we can borrow the full amount under each facility immediately 
none of the facilities are for commercial paper back up only and the facilities do not have usage fees 
these facilities may be renewed  extended or increased before they expire 
we borrowed the full amount under each facility during fiscal bank credit facility activity is summarized below in millions years ended july  amount of banks amount of banks total beginning of year new expired not renewed converted into term notes increased total end of year renewed at expiration term extended before expiration commercial paper we issue commercial paper direct and through a million program with maturities between and days 
the amount of commercial paper we could issue is limited to the unused amount of our committed credit facilities million at july  
information on the combined amounts of bank borrowings and commercial paper follows in millions years ended july  maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year outstanding at end of year contractual obligations our long term contractual obligations and other information at july  are summarized below in millions caption payments due by fiscal years total

the average maturity of our term notes and convertible debentures was years at july  and years at july  the term notes  convertible debentures and term asset securitization borrowings are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and operating leases in note the other long term liability is deferred compensation owed to an executive officer 
the other debt is bank borrowings and commercial paper that can be refinanced under long term committed bank credit facilities expiring on various dates through fiscal as shown in the table  cumulative scheduled collections of finance receivables exceed cumulative payments under contractual obligations each year 
stockholders equity we repurchased million shares of our common stock in fiscal for million at a average price per share 
we financed the repurchases with borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
there was million available for future repurchases under our program at july  we established our common stock and convertible debt repurchase program in fiscal and it does not have a set expiration 
repurchases are discretionary and are contingent upon many conditions 
we increased the amount available for future repurchases to million in september we paid million of cash dividends and we received million from stock option exercises and tax benefits from stock based awards in fiscal market interest rate risk and sensitivity we discuss how changes in market interest rates affect our net interest spread and how we manage interest rate risk in this section 
net interest spread net yield of finance receivables less cost of debt is an integral part of a finance company s profitability and is calculated below years ended july  net yield of finance receivables cost of debt net interest spread our net interest spread was basis points higher in fiscal compared to fiscal because decreases in market interest rates in fiscal lowered our cost of debt more than the net yield on our finance receivables 
short term market interest rates declined in fiscal significantly because the federal reserve lowered the target federal funds rate basis points in response to credit market conditions 
short term libor rates declined on average basis points in fiscal interest rates on our floating rate debt are indexed to short term libor rates 
this is the primary reason our cost of debt declined by basis points 
decreases in short term market interest rates lowered the net yield because the interest rates on our floating rate receivables are indexed to the prime rate 
the prime rate declined basis points in fiscal long term market interest rates also decreased significantly 
lower long term market interest rates would normally decrease the cost of fixed rate term debt and also result in lower yields on finance receivables  but these effects have been largely offset by significantly higher credit spreads 
our net interest spread is sensitive to changes in short term and long term market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates  swap rates and the prime rate 
increases in short term rates reduce our net interest spread and decreases in short term rates increase it because our floating rate debt includes short term debt exceeds our floating rate finance receivables by a significant amount 
interest rates on our debt change faster than the yield on our receivables because of our debt is floating rate compared to floating rate finance receivables of only 
our net interest spread is also affected when the differences between short term and long term rates change 
long term rates normally exceed short term rates 
when this excess narrows resulting in a flattening yield curve or when short term rates exceed long term rates an inverted yield curve  our net interest spread should decrease and when the yield curve widens our net interest spread should increase because the rates we charge our customers are largely determined by long term market interest rates and rates on our floating rate debt are largely determined by short term market interest rates 
we can mitigate the effects of an inverted yield curve by issuing long term fixed rate debt 
our net interest spread is also affected by credit spreads 
changes in credit spreads affect the yield on our receivables when originated and the cost of debt when issued 
credit spreads increased significantly during fiscal because of conditions in credit markets 
our income is subject to the risk of rising short term market interest rates and a flat or inverted yield curve because floating rate debt exceeded floating rate receivables by million at july  see the table below 
the terms and prepayment experience of fixed rate receivables mitigate this risk 
receivables are collected monthly over short periods of two to five years and have been accelerated by prepayments 
at july   million of fixed rate receivables are scheduled to be collected in one year and their average remaining life excluding prepayments is approximately twenty months 
historically  annual collections have exceeded of average receivables 
we do not match the maturities of our debt to our receivables 
the fixed and floating rate amounts and percentages of our receivables and capital at july  follow in millions fixed rate floating rate amount percent amount percent total finance receivables   debt  stockholders equity total debt and equity   floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings  term asset securitization borrowings and commercial paper  and will reprice interest rates change based on current short term market interest rates after july  as follows million within one month  million in two to three months and million in four to six months 
the repricing frequencies of floating rate debt follow in millions balance repricing frequency bank borrowings daily asset securitization borrowings term to days commercial paper to days day average we quantify interest rate risk by calculating the effect on net income of a hypothetical  immediate basis point rise in market interest rates 
this hypothetical change in rates would reduce annual net income by approximately million at july  based on scheduled repricings of floating rate debt  fixed rate debt maturing within one year and the expected effects on the yield of new receivables 
this amount increases to million excluding the effect on the yield of new receivables 
we believe these amounts are acceptable considering the cost of floating rate debt is lower than fixed rate debt 
actual future changes in market interest rates and the effect on net income may differ from these amounts materially 
other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point rise in market interest rates were not considered in the calculation 
these hypothetical reductions of net income at july  were million and million excluding the effect on the yield of new receivables 
the impact of this hypothetical increase in rates was lower in fiscal because the percentage of our floating rate debt declined to at july  from at july  we monitor and manage our exposure to potential adverse changes in market interest rates with derivative financial instruments and by changing the proportion of our fixed and floating rate debt 
we may use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on existing debt and debt expected to be issued 
we do not speculate with or trade derivatives 
we had no derivatives outstanding at july  we entered into interest rate locks in the form of treasury locks with a total notional amount of million in august we designated the rate locks as cash flow hedges of our anticipated issuance of fixed rate term debt hedging the risk of higher interest payments on the first five years of the debt from increases in market interest rates before the debt was issued 
we paid million when the rate locks expired in january we determined there was no hedge ineffectiveness and therefore we recorded the entire payment as a reduction of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of deferred income tax of million 
we are reclassifying the after tax amount into net income over the five year term of the debt issued in february by increasing interest expense and deferred income tax 
this effectively increased the interest rate on the debt 
we also had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million at july  we terminated million of these swaps early and million expired when the hedged debt matured in fiscal the swaps had no value at termination or expiration 
the swaps were designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate term debt and effectively converted fixed rate term debt into floating rate term debt 
we received fixed amounts from the swap counterparty banks equal to the interest we paid on the hedged debt  and we paid amounts to the swap counterparty banks equal to the swaps floating rates multiplied by the swaps notional amounts 
the swaps floating rates changed semiannually to a fixed amount over six month libor 
the swaps increased interest expense by million in fiscal and million fiscal the average pay rate was and the average receive rate was at july  new accounting standards financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb  fin no 
became effective for us on august  fin no 
requires us to determine if any tax positions taken on our income tax returns lowering the amount of tax currently due would more likely than not be allowed by a taxing authority 
if tax positions pass this more likely than not test  the benefits recorded from them are limited to the amount having a greater than chance of being realized upon being challenged by a taxing authority 
no income tax benefits can be recorded for tax positions failing the more likely than not test 
any unrecognized tax benefits and applicable interest and penalties must be accrued 
we record interest and penalties in income tax expense 
applying fin no 
to account for uncertain tax positions was not significantly different from how we previously accounted for uncertain tax positions because our income taxes are straightforward 
we have no foreign operations  we are not involved in any questionable tax transactions and we file returns in almost every state with a corporate income tax 
therefore  applying fin no 
did not result in an adjustment to beginning retained earnings nor did it affect our effective tax rate 
our fiscal and tax returns were audited by the irs in fiscal and our fiscal and tax returns were audited by the irs in fiscal these audits were completed with no changes to the tax we reported 
we only take uncertain positions on our income tax returns when tax law is unclear and subject to interpretation and we believe not taking the position would unfairly distort our income tax liability 
one state is currently examining our income tax returns 
our federal tax returns can be examined for three years and our state tax returns for three to five years after we file them 
the gross liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits was million on july  and august   and includes million and million of interest and penalties  respectively 
the entire amount at july   net of million of federal income tax benefits on state income taxes  would lower our effective tax rate if recognized 
we do not expect these amounts to change significantly in fiscal the fasb issued staff position fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  in june securities participating in dividends with common stock according to a formula are participating securities 
this fsp determined unvested shares of restricted stock and stock units with nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities 
participating securities require the two class method to be used to calculate basic earnings per share 
this method lowers basic earnings per common share 
this fsp takes effect in the first quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  and will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
it will take effect for us on august  we have million unvested shares of restricted stock and stock units with nonforfeitable rights to dividends 
based on this amount  our current dividend rate and number of shares of common stock outstanding  we estimate applying this fsp would reduce basic earnings per common share by 
this fsp will not affect diluted earnings per share 
the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlements  in may this fsp requires a portion of this type of convertible debt to be recorded as equity and to record interest expense on the debt portion at a rate that would have been charged on non convertible debt with the same terms 
this fsp takes effect in the first quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  and will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
it will take effect for us on august  this fsp will apply to our convertible debentures and we are evaluating how it may affect our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
in september and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
in february sfas no 
defines fair value replacing all prior definitions and creates a framework to measure fair value  but does not create any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates and to report unrealized gains and losses on these items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
these statements take effect in the first quarter of fiscal years beginning after november  and took effect for us on august  we do not expect they will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
