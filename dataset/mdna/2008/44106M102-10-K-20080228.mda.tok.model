ta is required to maintain  at its expense  the leased travel centers in good order and repair  including structural and non structural components  but may request that we fund amounts in addition to the  in return for minimum annual rent increases equal to a percentage of the amount we fund 
our lease agreement with ta expires on december  on may   we acquired petro for approximately  plus certain costs 
petro owns travel centers located in states 
in connection with our acquisition of petro  we acquired certain petro properties which secure debt that was previously issued by petro stopping centers  lp  or petro centers  a former subsidiary of petro acquired by ta on may  upon closing of our acquisition of petro  the petro centers debt assumed by ta was covenant defeased and funds were escrowed by ta at closing and used to redeem the petro centers debt on february  we agreed to pay certain costs associated with our acquisition of petro  including those relating to the defeasance and prepayment of the petro centers debt  and customary closing costs  which totaled approximately  we funded the purchase price and costs by borrowing under our revolving credit facility

as a result of renovations which required hotel rooms to be taken out of service in and  certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  and  less than the minimum returns due to us in and  respectively

we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels and for leased hotels where the ff e reserve is owned by our tenants as ff e reserve income

the increase to general and administrative expense is due principally to the impact of additional property investments during and we recorded a  loss on asset impairment in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of a hotel held for sale to its estimated net realizable value less costs to sell 
the increase in income tax expense is primarily due to increased canadian income taxes at one of our trss and higher state income taxes as a result of a change in tax laws in the state of texas

the increased revenues resulting from the higher adr was partially offset by lower revenues at certain of our managed hotels in which were under renovations in which required hotel rooms to be taken out of service 
additional operating statistics of our hotels is included in the table on page the increase in hotel operating expenses was caused by the increase in the number of managed hotels in due to our january and april hotel acquisitions and the general increase in the cost of labor and utilities in we recognized additional returns from our managed hotels of  and  in the fourth quarter of and  respectively

this increase was offset to some extent by the sale of a hotel in september and certain assets becoming fully depreciated in and the increase to general and administrative expense is due principally to the impact of additional hotel investments during in  we recorded a  loss on asset impairment to reduce the carrying value of a hotel held for sale to its estimated net realizable value less costs to sell 
the increase to income tax expense is primarily due to higher state income taxes as a result of our hotel acquisitions and increased canadian income taxes at our trs which owns hotels in canada

on a per share basis  the percentage increase in income from continuing operations available for common shareholders  income from discontinued operations available for common shareholders and net income available for common shareholders was lower due to our issuance of common shares in july and december and in june liquidity and capital resources our managers and tenants all of our properties are operated under management agreements or leases with third party operating companies 
all costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by the third party hotel managers as agents for us or by tenants for their own account 
these managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses  ff e reserves  and returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and  to the extent that these managers and tenants fund our minimum returns and minimum rents  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our combination management agreements or leases as total property sales minus all property level expenses that are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments due to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our operating agreements is presented in the table on pages and assuming our twelve operating agreements as of december   had been in place during the twelve months ended december  september   for the ta operating agreements  eleven combinations  representing properties  generated coverage of at least x using historical operating results 
the remaining combination  representing hotels  generated coverage of x in  twenty of the hotels in this combination were undergoing significant renovations that had a negative impact on the operating results of this combination during and we expect to complete renovations at these hotels in the first half of three hundred fifty two of our properties  representing of our total investments at cost as of december   in eight combinations are operated under management agreements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the total sales less total expenses and required ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us 
our managers and tenants or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases  do not subject us to repayment obligations but  under some of our agreements  these guarantee or supplemental payments may be recovered by the manager or tenant from the future cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid 
as of february   all payments due  including those payments due under the combination management agreement whose hotels generated less than x coverage during  are current 
however  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured 
if any of our property operators  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our revenues and cash flows will decline 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive additional returns  percentage returns and rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of all management fees and other deductions either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  interest and distributions to shareholders 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments for the foreseeable future 
we maintain our status as a real estate investment trust  or reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  or irc  by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
in  federal legislation known as the reit modernization act  or the rma  was enacted and became effective on january  the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to trss if the hotels are managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trss in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to income tax at corporate tax rates 
also  the income we receive from our hotels in canada  puerto rico and certain states is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at most of our hotels are escrowed as ff e reserves to fund future capital improvements at our hotels 
during  our managers and tenants contributed  to these accounts 
as of december   there was approximately  on deposit in these escrow accounts  which was held directly by us and is included on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
our hotel operating agreements generally provide that  if necessary  we will provide our managers and tenants funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts available in escrowed ff e reserves 
to the extent we make such additional ff e reserve fundings  our annual minimum returns or minimum rent generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund 
during  we funded  for capital improvements to our hotels in addition to ff e reserve fundings from hotel operations 
during   was spent from the ff e reserve escrow accounts to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
ff e escrow deposits are not required under our travel centers leases with ta 
however  ta is required to maintain the leased travel centers at its expense  including structural and non structural components 
under our ta lease for travel centers  we have agreed to fund up to  per year for certain specified capital improvements to the leased properties during the first five years of the lease term or thereafter on a cumulative basis 
all of the capital improvements funded under this agreement will be owned by us

we expect to fund approximately  for improvements to our four marriott branded hotel portfolios throughout with funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our minimum annual rent for these hotels is increased by approximately of the amounts we fund  which amounts are in addition to recurring ff e reserve funding from hotel operations

in order to fund capital improvements to our properties and acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of returns and rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders 
the maturity date of our revolving credit facility is october  and we have the option to extend the facility for one additional year upon payment of an extension fee 
the annual interest rate payable for drawn amounts under the facility is libor plus a premium per annum at december  
we may borrow up to  under the revolving credit facility and it includes a feature under which the maximum amount available for borrowing may be expanded to  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are unsecured

as of december   we had a balance of  outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and  available from our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions and other general business purposes 
our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in   in   in   in   in   in  and  in we expect to fund the redemption of our  of senior notes due march   with existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our convertible senior notes are convertible if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
as of december   we had one mortgage note we assumed in connection with our acquisition of one hotel with a current principal balance of  this mortgage note requires monthly payments of principal and interest of and is expected to have a principal balance of  at maturity in none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity date 
in connection with our acquisition of petro  we acquired certain petro properties which secure debt that was previously issued by petro centers 
upon closing of our acquisition of petro  the petro centers debt assumed by ta was covenant defeased and funds were escrowed at closing by ta and used to redeem this debt on february  when amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity or repurchase dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach over the longer term  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
although there can be no assurance that we will complete any debt or equity security offerings or other financings  we believe we will have access to various types of financing  including investment grade debt or equity securities  with which to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures and to pay our debt and other obligations 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations ground lease obligations capital improvements projected interest expense total of our hotels and of our travel centers are on land leased partially or in its entirety 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payments of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center 
represents amounts we expect to fund for capital improvements to our properties in addition to recurring ff e reserve funding from hotel operations 
projected interest expense is attributable to only the long term debt obligations listed above at existing rates and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments  new debt issuances or changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   our secured debt obligations were limited to one mortgage note of  secured by a single property 
none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december   consist of our revolving credit facility  our  of unsecured term debt and convertible notes and our  mortgage note 
our unsecured term debt and convertible notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain various financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements  nor our revolving credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit facility agreement  our senior debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of  or more 
similarly  a default on our public debt indenture would be a default on our credit facility 
related person transactions as more fully described above  on january   we acquired travelcenters and  in connection with the acquisition  restructured the business of travelcenters so as to place its operating business in our subsidiary  ta  distributed all of the common shares of ta  to our shareholders in a spin off transaction  and leased travel centers to ta for an average minimum rent of million per year during the lease term 
in order to effect the reorganization and spin off  we entered into a transaction agreement effective as of january   with ta and rmr 
that agreement provided for certain of the steps in the restructuring of the travelcenters business and the spin off 
in addition  under this agreement ta entered into a management and shared services agreement with rmr  ta granted to us a right of first refusal to purchase  lease  mortgage or otherwise finance any interest it owns or acquires in a travel center before it is purchased  sold  leased  mortgaged or otherwise financed with another party  and ta agreed to indemnify us for liabilities relating to its business and operations for periods before and after the spin off and for liabilities relating to the ownership and operation of the leased travel centers which arise during the term of our lease with ta 
on may   we purchased petro and simultaneously leased the travel centers owned by petro to a subsidiary of ta for an initial minimum rent of million per year 
starting in  the lease requires ta to pay us additional rent calculated as certain percentages of increases in gross revenues at the leased travel centers 
as a result of the transaction in january and the petro lease in may  we have on going business dealings with ta  including funding improvements to the leased properties and adding or removing properties from the leases 
rmr provides management services to us and to ta 
barry m 
portnoy  one of our managing trustees  is an owner and director of rmr and a managing director of ta 
adam d 
portnoy  our other managing trustee  is an owner  a director and president of rmr 
thomas m 
o brien is a senior vice president of rmr and a managing director and president of ta 
because of the potential for conflicts of interests between the responsibilities of messrs 
barry portnoy  adam portnoy and thomas o brien to us  rmr and ta  all transactions between us and ta are approved by our trustees who are independent of ta and rmr  and by ta s directors who are independent of us and rmr  respectively 
rmr presents investment and divestment opportunities to us and provides management and administrative services to us under an agreement 
rmr is compensated at an annual rate equal to of our average real estate investments  as defined  up to the first  and thereafter  plus an incentive fee based upon increases in cash available for distribution per share  as defined 
the incentive fee payable to rmr is paid in our common shares 
on january   we entered into a management agreement with rmr to operate the office building component of one of our properties 
fees paid to rmr under this management agreement are based on a formula  generally of gross collected rents as a property management fee and of gross construction costs as a construction management fee 
aggregate fees earned by rmr from us during were  which includes an incentive fee of  which we plan to pay later in through the issuance of  of our common shares 
rmr also provides the internal audit function for us and for other publicly traded companies to which it provides management or other services 
our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit and our compensation committee approves his salary and the other internal audit costs we pay 
our pro rata share of rmr s costs in providing that function was in all transactions between us and rmr are approved by our compensation committee 
both our audit and compensation committees are solely composed of independent trustees 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and assessments are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our five most critical accounting policies are as follows classification of leases 
certain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital lease or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
allocation of purchase price and recognition of depreciation and amortization expense 
the acquisition cost of each property investment is allocated to various property components such as land  buildings and equipment  and each component generally has a different useful life 
for real estate acquired  we allocate the purchase price among building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships 
acquisition cost allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on our estimates or studies from independent experts 
we compute related depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
the value of intangible assets is amortized over the shorter of its estimated useful life  or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs or incorrect estimates of useful lives could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate our real estate investments and intangible assets for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is determined through an evaluation of recent financial performance and projected discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate  fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
variable interest entities 
under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  it must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
generally  expected losses and expected residual returns are the expected negative and positive variability  respectively  in the fair value of the variable interest entities net assets 
when our trs enters a new operating agreement or materially modifies an existing operating agreement with a third party hotel manager we are required to assess if our trs is or continues to be the primary beneficiary 
this assessment requires us to make estimates of the future cash flows of our trs 
incorrect assumptions or estimates of  among other things  occupancy  average daily room rate and operating expenses of our hotels may result in an inaccurate determination of the primary beneficiary 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas accounting for income taxes 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the irc and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements 
we are subject to income tax in canada  puerto rico and in certain states despite our reit status 
further  we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned trs that  unlike most of our subsidiaries is generally subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the trs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our tax status as a reit 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin prescribes how we should recognize  measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return 
pursuant to fin  we can recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit 
to the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied  the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
as required  we adopted fin effective january  and have concluded that the effect is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense 
these policies involve significant judgments based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual values  the ability of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future we may need to revise our assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property management agreements  leases and operating statistics as of december   we owned hotels and travel centers which are grouped into twelve combinations 
our ten hotel combinations are managed by or leased to subsidiaries of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host hotels resorts inc  or host  barcelo crestline corporation  or barcelo crestline  hyatt and carlson 
our travel centers are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of ta under two agreements 
the tables on the following pages summarize the key terms of our leases and management agreements as of december   and include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our managers and tenants 
these statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy  average daily rate  or adr  revenue per day per available room  or revpar  for our hotel properties 
we consider these statistics  and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables on the following pages  to be important measures of our managers and tenants success in operating our properties and their ability to continue to pay us 
however  none of this third party reported information is a direct measure of our financial performance and none of it has been independently verified by us

seasonality our hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flow because our contractual management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return payments and rents to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
seasonality may affect our hotel operating revenues  but we do not expect seasonal variations to have a material impact upon our financial results of operations or upon our managers or tenants ability to meet their contractual obligations to us 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our managers or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of insufficient income at our properties  all of our operating agreements contain security features  such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future  the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
as of december   our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of eight issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes and one issue of fixed rate convertible senior notes annual annual principal balance interest rate interest expense maturity interest payments due semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually semi annually the convertible senior notes are convertible if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
except as described in the footnote to the table above  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
however  if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately  change in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our  of convertible senior notes 
each of these fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
at december   we had one mortgage payable secured by one hotel  with a fixed rate of that matures on july  this note requires principal and interest payments through maturity pursuant to an amortization schedule and contains a provision that allows us to make repayment at a premium to face value 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in october we can extend the maturity for one year for a fee 
at december   we had  outstanding and  available for drawing under our revolving credit facility 
repayments under this agreement may be made at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under these agreements are subject to interest at libor plus a premium 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of  under our revolving credit facility was per annum at december  the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on our weighted average floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  increase reduction the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or acquisition facility
