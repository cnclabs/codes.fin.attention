item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
however  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face  including but not limited to those risks stated in risk factors  or faulty assumptions on our part 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview bluefly  inc is a leading internet retailer that sells over brands of designer apparel  accessories and home furnishings at discounts of up to off of retail value 
we launched our web site in september we believe that there is an opportunity to accelerate the growth of our business while continuing to provide our customers with the great values that they have become accustomed to 
in an effort to take advantage of this opportunity  we began a national advertising campaign that featured both print and television 
over the past two and a half years  we have increased awareness by targeting general advertising efforts to a more fashion focused consumer 
in  we further refined our marketing strategy by aligning ourselves with entertainment properties  such as bravotv 
com and project runway 
during the third quarter of  we completed our transition to a new third party distribution center 
in connection with this transition  we incurred incremental expenses of approximately  in costs directly related to the move including trucking  labor  insurance  etc we took additional charges of approximately  against our inventory during the third quarter of based on the reconciliation of inventory that we normally perform in connection with each quarter s close 
we believe that the charges that were taken were sufficient to cover any loss of inventory resulting from the transition 
we have worked with the distribution center to implement necessary changes to their inventory reporting systems as a result of the full physical inventory that was performed in january  following the end of the holiday sales and returns cycle 
we believe that significant operational issues related to the move have been resolved 
start up issues associated with the transition to the new distribution center also resulted in certain cancelled orders and other incremental costs such as expedited shipping costs 
as a result of the transition  during the period from june through mid september  a portion of the company s inventory was not available for sale to our customers and  therefore  our revenue during this period was adversely affected 
because the increased inventory level could adversely affect our flexibility in taking advantage of other buying opportunities that may become available in the near term  and because of our desire to keep our merchandise fresh we decided not to carry some of this inventory into next season  and removed it from our web site 
we believe that by doing so  we will improve the efficiency of the new fulfillment center and enhance the customer experience 
we have taken an inventory write down with respect to this merchandise because it is being removed from our web site 
the net effect to the statement of operations of removing this inventory from our site  was approximately million 
in addition  during this transition period  the company experienced some processing issues with a small percentage of orders and returns 
we believe we have taken the appropriate action related to the customers affected by these processing issues 
in the long term  we expect the transition to the new distribution center to improve customer service and increase efficiencies  however  there can be no assurance that the transition will not continue to have a negative impact upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net sales increased nearly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  on a quarterly basis  our net sales increased by approximately   and  respectively  as compared to the same periods in our gross margin decreased to from in our gross profit increased by nearly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily related to i a write off of inventory ii a change in the merchandise mix iii expedited shipping cost incurred in connection with our transition to the new third party fulfillment center and iv the additional reserves against inventory taken as a result of the transition to the new fulfillment center  as described above 
our operating loss increased by over  to  in  from  in this increase was primarily a result of a write of inventory in the fourth quarter  an increase in stock based compensation as a result of equity awards granted in the fourth quarter of stock based compensation was million for the year ended december  versus million for the same period last year as well as costs incurred in connection with our transition to the new fulfillment center  and increased marketing expenses 
total marketing expenses increased by to  for the full year  from  for the full year we increased our spending in marketing excluding staff related costs by to  for the full year  from  for the full year the primary goal of our marketing campaign is to build upon the awareness created by the initial launch of the campaign in fall  both with new customers as well as with our existing customers 
a large portion of the increased marketing expense was a result of the costs associated with our sponsorships with entertainment properties 
we believe that this investment in marketing is a prudent investment in our business given that our margin structure and average order size have historically resulted in a relatively high positive contribution to overhead and marketing on a customer s first order 
our reserve for returns and credit card chargebacks remained unchanged at of gross sales for the years ended december  and respectively 
in general  our merchandise mix has been shifting towards higher end products which tend to drive return rates higher 
we continually try to refine our merchandise mix to reduce the return rate 
however  we believe that the higher return rates will be more than offset by the higher gross margin dollars and average order sizes 
as such  we continually evaluate our merchandise mix in an effort to reduce return rates 
a portion of our inventory includes merchandise that we either purchased with the intention of holding for the appropriate season or were unable to sell through in its entirety in a prior season and have determined to hold for the next selling season  subject to appropriate mark downs 
we evaluate our inventory on a quarterly basis to determine the lower of cost or the fair market value of that inventory based upon age of the inventory  market factors  and historical trends among other factors  and take the appropriate reserves against inventory 
in recent years we have increased the amount of inventory purchased on a pack and hold basis in order to take advantage of opportunities in the market 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires expensing of stock options 
as a result  we recorded total share based compensation expenses of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  results for prior periods have not been restated due to the adoption based on the modified prospective approach 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of  the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted primarily from the costs associated with developing and marketing our web site and building our infrastructure  as well as noncash beneficial conversion charges resulting from decreases in the conversion price of our preferred stock and the payment of dividends to holders of preferred stock 
in order to expand our business  we intend to invest in sales  marketing  merchandising  operations  information systems  site development and additional personnel to support these activities 
therefore  we may continue to incur substantial operating losses 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years  this growth may not be sustainable and therefore should not be considered indicative of future performance 
critical accounting policies management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns  recoverability of inventories  useful lives of property and equipment  the realization of deferred tax assets  and the calculations related to stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
gross sales consists primarily of revenue from product sales and shipping and handling charges and is net of promotional discounts 
net sales represent gross sales  less provisions for returns  credit card chargebacks  and adjustments for uncollected sales taxes 
revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are met o a customer executes an order 
o the product price and the shipping and handling fee have been determined 
o credit card authorization has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
o the product has been shipped and received by the customer 
shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb task force s emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs eitf no 

provision for returns and doubtful accounts we generally permit returns for any reason within days of the sale 
accordingly  we establish a reserve for estimated future returns and bad debt at the time of shipment based primarily on historical data 
we perform credit card authorizations and check the verification of our customers prior to shipment of merchandise 
however  our future return and bad debt rates could differ from historical patterns  and  to the extent that these rates increase significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories  which consist of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information  about the saleability of such merchandise  the selling price  etc 
based upon this evaluation  we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and establish a reserve for such merchandise 
deferred tax valuation allowance we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income or loss in the period that included the enactment date 
we have assessed the future taxable income and determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
effective january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
as of the date of adoption  there were no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months from the date of adoption of fin or from december  as of december   the only tax jurisdiction to which the company is subject is the united states 
open tax years relate to years in which unused net operating losses were generated 
upon the adoption of fin  the company s open tax years extend back to in the event that the company concludes that it is subject to interest and or penalties arising form uncertain tax positions  the company will present interest and penalties as a component of income taxes 
no amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in the company s statement of operations or balance sheet upon adoption of fin or as of and for the year ended december  stock based compensation as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past

del average order size including shipping handling new customers added during the year    del 
based on unique email addresses in addition  to the financial statement items and metrics listed above  we also report gross sales  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we define gross sales as the total dollar amount of orders received by customers including shipping and handling net of customer credits  but before any reserves are taken for returns or bad debt 
we believe that the presentation of gross sales is useful to investors because a it provides an alternative measure of the total demand for the products sold by the company and b it provides a basis upon with which to measure the percentage of total demand that is reserved for both returns and bad debt 
management uses the gross sales measure for these same reasons 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales gross sales for the year ended december  increased by approximately to  from  for the year ended december  the increase in gross sales was partially offset by lost sales and cancelled orders attributable to start up issues at our new distribution center

cost of sales for the year ended december  totaled  resulting in a gross margin of 
the decrease in gross margin percentage is largely attributed to a write off of inventory in the fourth quarter 
the effect of this write off on gross margin dollars was approximately million 
in addition  the growth in the high end designer items has a significant impact on the company s overall merchandise mix  which continues to negatively impact the gross margin percentage 
the combination of the high demand amongst retailers for high end merchandise and the decline in value of the us dollar relative to the euro had a negative impact on our gross margins related to designer accessory items 
in addition  the gross margin was negatively affected by additional inventory reserves  and expedited shipping expenses that were recorded during the third quarter and incurred in connection with our transition to a new fulfillment center 
gross profit as a result of the increases in net sales  gross profit increased by nearly  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  marketing expenses marketing expenses increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in online advertising  offline advertising and sponsorship and direct mail postcards

in march  we entered into an agreement with soros and maverick pursuant to which they agreed to provide up to million of debt financing to us  on a standby basis  during the next year  provided that the commitment amount will be reduced by the gross proceeds of any equity financing consummated during the year 
we can draw down debt in one or more tranches  provided that our cash balances are less than million at the time of any draw down 
the draw downs will be evidenced by subordinated convertible notes the subordinated notes that have a term expiring on the later of june  and three years from the date of the issuance of the subordinated notes and bear interest at the rate of per annum  compounded annually 
interest is payable upon maturity or conversion 
the subordinated notes are convertible subject to stockholder approval to the extent required by the nasdaq capital market  at the holder s option a into equity securities that the company might issue in any subsequent round of financing at a price that was equal to the lowest price per share paid by any investor in such subsequent round of financing or b into common stock at a price per share equal to the market price as defined in the subordinated notes on the date of issuance of the note 
in connection with the commitment  we issued warrants to soros and maverick to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the trailing day average stock price on the date of grant 
we fund our operations through cash on hand  operating cash flow and the proceeds of any equity or debt financing 
operating cash flow is affected by revenue and gross margin levels  as well as return rates  and any deterioration in our performance with respect to these financial measures would have a negative impact on our liquidity 
total availability under our credit facility with wells fargo is based primarily upon our inventory levels 
in addition  both availability under the credit facility and our operating cash flows are affected by the payment terms that we receive from suppliers and service providers  and the extent to which suppliers require us to request wells fargo to provide credit support under the credit facility 
in some instances  new vendors may require prepayments 
we may make prepayments in order to open up these new relationships  or to gain access to inventory that would not otherwise be available to us 
in addition  we sometimes make prepayments in connection with our advertising campaign  as in some circumstances we need to pay in advance of production 
as of december   we had approximately  of prepaid inventory and  of prepaid advertising on our balance sheet  as compared to  and  as of december  and  and  as of december  our inventory levels as of december  were approximately million higher than at december  the increase in inventory generally reflects a ramp up in connection with our sales growth but also is a result of some of our inventory not being available for sale during our move to our new third party fulfillment center 
as a result we expect to carry some of this inventory into next season 
however  the increased inventory level could adversely affect our flexibility in taking advantage of other buying opportunities that may become available in the near term 
we believe that our current funds  together with working capital  and operating cash flow  and availability under our existing credit facility and standby commitment from soros and maverick will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
credit facility in july  we entered into a new three year revolving credit facility with wells fargo 
pursuant to the credit facility  wells fargo provides us with a revolving loan and issues letters of credit in favor of suppliers or factors 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets 
historically  the credit facility had also been secured by a letter of credit issued by soros the soros lc 
in august  wells fargo agreed to release the soros lc  and that it would no longer require an availability reserve although it has the right under the credit facility to establish reserves in the future  as it deems appropriate  so long as we maintain a minimum cash balance of  furthermore  our credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends without the consent of our lender 
see note to the financial statements 
availability under the credit facility is determined by a formula that considers a certain percentage of our inventory and a certain percentage of accounts receivable 
the maximum availability is currently  but can be increased to  at our request  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   total availability under the credit facility was approximately  of which  was committed  leaving approximately  available for further borrowings 
interest accrues monthly on the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility during the preceding month at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate plus or libor plus for average excess availability less than million and the prime rate plus or libor plus for average excess availability greater than million 
we also pay a monthly commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility ie   less the amount of loans outstanding equal to 
we also pay wells fargo certain fees to open letters of credit and guarantees in an amount equal to a certain specified percentage of the face amount of the letter of credit for each thirty days such letter of credit  or a portion thereof  remains open 
subsequent to year end  we amended the agreement with wells fargo  see recent developments for a full description of the amendment
