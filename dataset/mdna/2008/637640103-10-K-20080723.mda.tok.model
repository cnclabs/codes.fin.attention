overview we are one of the world s leading semiconductor companies focused on analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
founded in  we design  develop  manufacture and market high value  high performance  analog intensive solutions that provide more energy efficiency  greater portability  better audio  sharper images and higher performance in electronic systems 
we have a diversified product portfolio which includes products such as power management circuits  audio and operational amplifiers  display drivers  communication interface products  and data conversion solutions 
our portfolio of over  products is sold to a diversified group of end customers 
energy efficiency is our overarching theme and our powerwise products enable systems that consume less power  extend battery life and generate less heat 
we target a broad range of markets and applications such as wireless handsets automotive applications wireless basestations factory and office automation networks medical applications industrial markets photovoltaic systems a broad range of portable applications we benefit from an extensive intellectual property portfolio that includes more than  patents 
we are focused on supporting the innovation needed for a strong new product development pipeline 
for fiscal  our net sales were billion  our operating income was million and our net income was million 
a large portion of our sales come from analog products that are classified within the standard linear categories as defined by the world semiconductor trade statistics or wsts 
standard linear products are defined by wsts as amplifiers  data converters  regulators and references power management  and interface products  representing the fundamental circuits that electronic systems need in order to deal with continuously varying signals of the real world  such as light  sound  pressure  temperature and speed 
within the standard linear analog market  our greatest strengths have historically been in the power management  amplifier  and interface areas 
we focus on high performance opportunities within the standard linear market  as high performance integrated circuits both have the most stringent performance requirements  enabling us to add the most value to our customers  and tend to be more proprietary in nature  typically resulting in higher gross margins 
approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal was generated from analog based products 
our operations are organized into two groups the power management group and the signal path group 
the power management group is responsible primarily for designing and developing a wide range of integrated circuits that convert and regulate voltages to ensure that electronic systems operate to their fullest potential with the lowest overall power consumption or the highest energy efficiency 
the signal path group primarily supplies integrated circuits that handle the requisite analog technology for information or data as it travels from the point where it enters the electronic system  and is conditioned  converted and processed to the point where it is sent out 
in addition to providing real world interfaces  these products are used extensively in signal conditioning  signal conversion from analog to digital and vice versa and high speed interfacing applications

recent highlights throughout fiscal  we continued to focus on analog product areas  particularly higher performance  higher value areas where we are able to leverage the increasing need for energy efficiency 
as a part of our business focus  we periodically identify opportunities to improve our cost structure or to divest or reduce involvement in product areas that are not in line with our business objectives  as well as pursue acquisitions or business investments to gain access to key technologies that we believe augment our existing technical capability and support our business objectives 
for example  in january  we announced that we would dispose of certain manufacturing equipment and reduce the workforce at our wafer fabrication facilities as part of an action to modernize our facilities and rationalize our capacity 
in april  we announced a workforce reduction  primarily in product line and support functions  as part of our effort to strategically align resources in connection with our focus on accelerating revenue growth in key market areas that require better power management and energy efficiency 
in june  our board of directors approved i a billion accelerated stock repurchase program  and ii an additional million stock repurchase program similar to our existing stock repurchase program announced in march we entered into two agreements with goldman  sachs co 
goldman sachs to conduct the accelerated stock repurchase program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these agreements 
we also entered into a billion unsecured bridge credit facility with an affiliate of goldman sachs and used the funds to finance the accelerated stock repurchase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the credit facility which was subsequently repaid 
the billion accelerated stock repurchase program was completed in december with a total of million shares repurchased 
in connection with the accelerated stock repurchase program  we completed a public offering of billion of senior unsecured notes in june the net proceeds from this offering were used to partially repay indebtedness under the unsecured bridge credit facility used to finance the accelerated stock repurchase 
in july  we entered into a million unsecured term loan with a consortium of banks and used the funds to repay the remaining amounts outstanding under the unsecured bridge credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the senior unsecured notes and the bank term loan 
in addition to the accelerated stock repurchase program  we repurchased an additional million shares of our common stock during fiscal for million as part of two million stock repurchase programs i the million stock repurchase program announced in march and ii the million stock repurchase program announced in june all of these shares were repurchased in the open market 
for all of fiscal  we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for  million through both the billion accelerated stock repurchase program and the two million stock repurchase programs 
we also continued our dividend program in fiscal  during which time we paid a total of million in cash dividends 
subsequent to fiscal year end  on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  page of products semiconductors are integrated circuits in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated circuit or discrete devices such as individual transistors 
in an integrated circuit  various components are fabricated in a small area or chip of silicon  which is then encapsulated in plastic  ceramic or other advanced forms of packaging and can then be connected to a circuit board or substrate 
we manufacture an extensive range of analog intensive and mixed signal integrated circuits  which are used in numerous applications 
while no precise industry definition exists for analog and mixed signal devices  we consider products which process analog information or convert analog to digital or digital to analog as analog and mixed signal devices 
we are a leading supplier of analog and mixed signal products  serving both broad based markets such as the industrial  communications  computing  consumer  medical and automotive markets  and more narrowly defined markets such as wireless handsets  displays  personal computers and communications infrastructure 
our analog and mixed signal devices include operational and audio amplifiers communication interface circuits power references  regulators and switches flat panel display drivers and signal processors analog to digital or digital to analog converters radio frequency integrated circuits other product offerings that are not analog or mixed signal include microcontrollers and embedded bluetooth tm solutions that collectively serve a wide variety of applications in the wireless  personal computer  industrial  automotive  consumer and communication markets 
our diverse portfolio of intellectual property enables us to develop building block products  application specific standard products and custom large scale integrations for our customers 
our high performance building blocks and application specific standard products allow our customers to solve challenging technical problems and to differentiate their systems in a way that is beneficial to the end user 
with our leadership in innovative packaging and analog process technology  we can address growth opportunities that depend upon the critical elements of efficiency  physical size and performance 
we directly service top tier original equipment manufacturers oems in a number of markets and we reach a broader range of customers through our franchised distributors 
corporate organization during fiscal  our business operations were organized in two groups the power management group and the signal path group 
each group is responsible for various product line business units 
many of our products in each group are part of our powerwise portfolio of products  which are parts that are deemed to be highly energy efficient relative to the function they are performing 
power management group the power management group includes four different business units in the power management area advanced power  infrastructure power  mobile devices power and performance power 
the power management group also contains the asic telecom business unit 
power management refers to the conversion and management of power consumption in electronic systems 
integrated circuits such as digital processors  analog to digital converters and light emitting diodes each require different power sources to operate efficiently 
power management integrated circuits convert and regulate voltages to ensure that electronic systems operate to their fullest potential while achieving the lowest overall power consumption 
our high performance power management portfolio provides valuable solutions to our customers to solve design problems in space and energy constrained applications from feature rich handheld devices to large line powered systems 
we are focusing efforts on developing power management circuits for energy conservation applications 
page of the four business units that address power management design  develop and manufacture a wide range of products including high efficiency switching voltage regulators and controllers high performance low drop out voltage regulators accurate led drivers precision voltage references battery management integrated circuits mobile pixel link mpl serial bridges display drivers we are growing our power management business by balancing our focus between broad customer needs and specific target markets 
we continue to strengthen our broad portfolio of power management integrated circuits which can address customer needs in a variety of end markets such as consumer  industrial  medical  automotive and communications infrastructure 
at the same time  we focus on markets  such as personal mobile devices  which can provide more rapid growth opportunities from customers that value the performance our products deliver  such as energy efficiency and size or heat reduction 
we continue to enhance the performance of power management building blocks in terms of providing greater efficiency  increased power density  tighter accuracy and wider voltage ranges 
these building block products serve as the foundation for the development of highly integrated application specific standard products for high volume applications 
the asic telecom business unit supplies user designed application specific products in the form of standard cells  gate arrays and full custom devices 
this business unit also supplies key telecommunications components for analog and digital line cards  as well as bit and bit microcontrollers 
signal path group key business units under the signal path group include the amplifiers  audio  data conversion and interface business units  as well as hi rel operations 
the signal path refers to the analog technology that is applied to the path that information or data travels along from the point where it enters the electronic equipment and is conditioned  converted and processed to the point where it is sent out 
our signal path products provide a vital technology link that allows the user to connect to digital information and are used to enable and enrich the user experience of sight and sound from many electronic applications 
in addition to providing the real world interfaces  signal path products are used extensively in signal conditioning  signal conversion from analog to digital and vice versa and high speed signal interfacing applications 
the signal path group designs  develops and manufactures a wide range of products including high speed and precision operational amplifiers high fidelity  low power audio amplifiers high speed and precision analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters precision timing products high speed communication interface and signal conditioning products thermal management products we are expanding our presence in key market segments by developing more high performance analog products that can address applications in the consumer  industrial  medical  automotive and communications infrastructure markets 
with our growing product portfolio of high performance building blocks  we continue to improve performance by providing greater precision  higher speed and lower power which our customers value 
these building block products serve as the starting point for the development of highly integrated application specific standard products for high volume applications 
the hi rel business unit of the signal path group supplies integrated circuits and contract services to the high reliability market  which includes avionics  defense and aerospace customers 
worldwide marketing and sales group  technology development group and manufacturing operations group separate from our business operating groups  our corporate structure in fiscal includes a centralized worldwide marketing and sales group  a technology development group and a manufacturing operations group 
page of the worldwide marketing and sales group is our global sales and marketing organization organized around the four major regions of the world where we operate 
we define our four major regions as the americas  asia pacific  europe and japan which is not a part of the asia pacific region 
reference to these regions elsewhere in this document is based on this definition 
the technology development group is a centralized worldwide organization primarily responsible for process development  technology infrastructure  quality assurance and shared engineering services 
process development consists of research in and development of proprietary processes for the manufacture of our products 
technology infrastructure provides a range of process libraries  product cores and software  and the selection and support of computer aided design tools used in the design  layout and simulation of our products 
engineering services provide test development and reliability services used broadly across our product lines 
the manufacturing operations group is a centralized worldwide organization that manages all production  including outsourced manufacturing  global logistics and packaging technology 
segment financial information and geographic information for segment reporting purposes  each of our product line business units represents an operating segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
business units that have similarities  including economic characteristics  underlying technology  markets and customers  are aggregated into larger segments 
under the criteria in sfas no 
 analog is our only reportable segment for fiscal the remaining business units that are not included in the analog reportable segment are grouped as all others 
our business is dependent on the success of our analog segment since it represents approximately percent of our sales in fiscal consequently  the analog segment faces the same risks as those for the company as a whole including risks attendant to our foreign operations 
for a more complete discussion of those risks  see the section under risk factors that appears in part i  item a of this form k 
for further financial information on the analog reportable segment  as well as geographic information  refer to the information contained in note  segment and geographic information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item marketing and sales we market our products globally to oems and original design manufacturers odms through a direct sales force 
some of our major oems include apple nokia siemens network seagate lg electronics panasonic sharp lm ericsson research in motion ltd siemens motorola robert bosch sony ericsson mobile communications nokia samsung tektronix it is becoming increasingly common in the technology industry for oems to use contract manufacturers to build their products and odms to design and build products 
as a result  our design wins with major oems  particularly in the computing and cellular phone markets  can ultimately result in sales to a third party contract manufacturer or odm 
in addition to our direct sales force  we use distributors in our four geographic business regions  and approximately percent of our fiscal net sales were made to distributors 
in line with industry practices  we generally credit distributors for the effect of price reductions on their inventory of our products and  under specific conditions  we repurchase products that we have discontinued 
distributors do not have the right to return product except under customary warranty provisions 
the programs we offer to our distributors include the following allowances involving pricing and volume 
we refer to this as the contract sales debit program 
allowances for inventory scrap 
we refer to this as the scrap allowance program 
under the contract sales debit program  products are sold to distributors at standard prices published in price books that are broadly provided to our various distributors 
distributors are required to pay for this product within our standard commercial terms 
after the initial purchase of the product  the distributor has the opportunity to request a price allowance for a particular part number depending on the current market conditions for that specific part as well as volume page of considerations 
this request is made prior to the distributor reselling the part 
once we have approved an allowance to the distributor  the distributor proceeds with the resale of the product and credits are issued to the distributor in accordance with the specific allowance that we approved 
periodically  we issue new distributor price books 
for those parts for which the standard prices have been reduced  we provide an immediate credit to distributors for inventory quantities they have on hand 
under the scrap allowance program  certain distributors are given a contractually defined allowance to cover the cost of any scrap they might incur 
the amount of the allowance is specifically agreed upon with each distributor 
our regional facilities in the united states  europe  japan and asia pacific region handle local customer support 
these customer support centers respond to inquiries on product pricing and availability  pre sale customer technical support requests  order entry and scheduling  and post sale support under our product warranty provisions 
the technical support provided to our customers consists of marketing activities that occur prior to sale of product to our customers and for which we have no contractual obligation and no fees are charged 
technical support consists primarily of aiding customers in product selection and answering questions about our products 
we augment our sales effort with application engineers based in the field 
these engineers are specialists in various aspects of our product portfolio and work with customers to identify and design our integrated circuits into customers products and applications 
these engineers also help identify emerging markets for new products and are supported by our design centers in the field or at manufacturing sites 
we also provide web based  on line tools that allow customers and potential customers to select our devices  create a design using our parts  and simulate performance of that design 
customers our top tencustomers combined represented approximately percent of total accounts receivable at may  and approximately percent at may  net sales to major customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows years ended may  may  may  distributor avnet arrow oem nokia less than although we do not have any other customers with sales greater than percent  we do have several other large oem customers that manufacture and market wireless handsets and other electronic products 
these customers typically purchase a range of different products from us 
if any one of these customers were to cease purchasing products from us within a very short timeframe  such as within one quarter  it could have a negative impact on our financial results for that period 
backlog in accordance with industry practice  we frequently revise semiconductor backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders to reflect changes in customer needs 
we rarely formally enforce binding agreements for the sale of specific quantities at specific prices that are contractually subject to price or quantity revisions  consistent with industry practice 
for these reasons  we do not believe it is meaningful to disclose the amount of backlog at any particular date 
seasonality we are affected by the seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and third fiscal quarters  primarily due to customer vacation and holiday schedules 
sales usually reach a seasonal peak in our fourth fiscal quarter 
this typical seasonal trend did not occur during fiscal since sales in our first quarter of fiscal were percent higher than sales in the previous fourth quarter of fiscal and our fiscal sales page of peaked in the second quarter of fiscal sales in the third quarter of fiscal declined nearly percent compared to the previous second quarter due to a combination of lower demand in the wireless handset market and holiday seasonality 
although sales in the last quarter of fiscal increased sequentially over the third quarter level  sales in the fourth quarter were lower than sales in each of the first two quarters of fiscal manufacturing the design of semiconductor and integrated circuit products is shaped by general market needs and customer requirements 
following product design and development  we generally produce integrated circuits in the following steps wafer fabrication 
product designs are compiled and digitized by state of the art design equipment and then transferred to silicon wafers in a series of complex precision processes that include oxidation  lithography  chemical etching  diffusion  deposition  implantation and metallization 
wafer sort 
the silicon wafers are tested and separated into individual circuit devices 
product assembly 
tiny wires are used to connect the electronic circuits on the device to the stronger metal leads of the package in which the device is encapsulated for protection 
final test 
the devices are subjected to a series of vigorous tests using computerized circuit testers and  for certain applications  environmental testers such as burn in ovens  centrifuges  temperature cycle or moisture resistance testers  salt atmosphere testers and thermal shock testers 
coating 
certain devices in the analog portfolio are designed to be used without traditional packaging 
in this case  the integrated circuit is coated with a protective material to allow mounting directly onto a circuit board 
our product groups are supported by our global manufacturing infrastructure 
we have developed a number of proprietary manufacturing processes and packaging technologies to support our broad portfolio of analog products 
substantially all of our products are manufactured in our three wafer fabrication facilities in maine  texas and scotland 
assembly and test are performed primarily at our facilities in malaysia and china 
at times and as needed  we outsource certain manufacturing functions to address capacity and other economic issues 
our wafer manufacturing processes include bipolar  metal oxide silicon  complementary metal oxide silicon and bipolar complementary metal oxide silicon technologies  including silicon germanium 
our efforts are heavily focused on proprietary processes that support our analog portfolio of products  which address wireless handsets  other personal mobile devices and a broad variety of other electronic applications 
the feature size of the individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns  one micron equals one millionth of a meter 
as products decrease in size and increase in functionality  our wafer fabrication facilities must be able to manufacture integrated circuits with sub micron circuit pattern widths 
this precision fabrication carries over to assembly and test operations  where advanced packaging technology and comprehensive testing are required to address the ever increasing performance and complexity embedded in integrated circuits 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use certain key raw materials critical to our products 
these include silicon wafers  certain chemicals and gases  ceramic and plastic packaging materials and various precious metals 
we also rely on subcontractors to supply finished or semi finished products which we then market through our sales channels 
we obtain raw materials and semi finished or finished products from various sources  although the number of sources for any particular material or product is relatively limited 
we believe our current supply of essential materials is sufficient to meet our needs 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
significant increases in demand  rapid product mix changes or natural disasters could affect our ability to procure materials or goods 
research and development our research and development efforts consist of research in metallurgical  electro mechanical and solid state sciences  manufacturing process development and product design 
research and development of most process technologies are conducted by our technology development group 
specific product design and development is generally done in our business units 
total research and development expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  compared to million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  and million for fiscal  or percent of net sales 
although r d expenses in fiscal were at a comparable level to r d expenses in fiscal  we have continued to increase our investment in research and development on analog product areas 
share based compensation expense included in r d expense for fiscal was million compared to fiscal which was million 
page of this decrease in share based compensation expenses more than offset higher spending in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of xignal technologies ag xignal in january  as well as higher payroll and employee benefits expenses 
we are continuing to concentrate our research and development spending on analog products and underlying analog capabilities such as dc to dc power conversion  signal conditioning  high speed amplification and low power analog to digital conversion 
during fiscal  research and development spending in the analog segment was percent higher compared to fiscal and we continue to invest in the development of new analog products that can serve applications in a wide variety of end markets such as personal mobile devices  communications infrastructure  alternative energy  industrial and medical 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
patents we own numerous united states and non us patents and have many patent applications pending 
we consider the development of patents and the maintenance of an active patent program advantageous to the conduct of our business 
however  we believe that continued success will depend more on engineering  production  marketing  financial and managerial skills than on our patent program 
we license certain of our patents to other manufacturers and participate in a number of cross licensing arrangements and agreements with other parties 
each license agreement has unique terms and conditions  with variations as to length of term  royalties payable  permitted uses and scope 
the majority of these agreements are cross licenses in which we grant a broad license to our intellectual property in exchange for receiving a similar corresponding license from the other party  and none are exclusive 
the amount of income we have received from licensing agreements has varied in the past  and we cannot precisely forecast the amount and timing of future income from licensing agreements 
on an overall basis  we believe that no single license agreement is material to us  either in terms of royalty payments due or payable or intellectual property rights granted or received 
employees at may   we employed approximately  people of whom approximately  were employed in the united states  in europe   in southeast asia  in china and in other areas 
we believe that our future success depends fundamentally on our ability to recruit and retain skilled technical and professional personnel 
our employees in the united states are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations worldwide to be favorable 
competition competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
with our focus on high value analog  our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim integrated products and texas instruments 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products and markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
environmental regulations to date  our compliance with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  competitive or financial position 
for more information  see item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item however  we could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future statutes and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
page of item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
we review and update our risk factors each quarter 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations  results or financial condition 
you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and our other filings with the sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings 
these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like national with broad international operations 
like other companies  we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers 
similarly  the price of our stock is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions  differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community  and other factors beyond our control 
risk factors relating to general business conditions a large portion of our revenues is dependent on the wireless handset market 
the wireless handset market is a significant source of our overall sales 
new products are being developed to address new features and functionality in handsets  such as advanced color displays  advanced audio  lighting features and battery management that can adequately handle the demands of these advanced features 
due to high levels of competition  as well as complex technological requirements  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in this targeted market 
although the worldwide handset market is large  growth trends and other variables are often uncertain and difficult to predict 
since the wireless handset market is a consumer driven market  changes in the economy that affect consumer demand can adversely affect our business and operating results 
reduced consumer or corporate spending due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
we depend on demand from the consumer  original equipment manufacturer  contract manufacturing  industrial  automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications which incorporate our products 
our revenues and gross margins are based on certain levels of consumer and corporate spending 
if our projections of these expenditures fail to materialize due to reductions in consumer or corporate spending as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment  such as continuing increases in oil prices  fluctuations in interest rates  subprime mortgage failures  or otherwise  our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 
conditions inherent in the semiconductor industry may cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and integrated products characterize the semiconductor industry 
the result is a cyclical environment with potentially short product life cycles  even with analog products which form the core of our strategic focus 
we have seen and may see in the future significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand 
substantial capital and r d investment are required to support products and manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry  which amplify the effect of this cyclicality although less capital investment is needed for analog products than for many other semiconductor products 
as a result of this environment  we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
market shifts in product mix toward or away from higher margin products  including analog products  may also have a significant impact on our operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results could fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets 
competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim integrated products and texas instruments 
these companies sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products  markets and customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition 
page of risk factors relating to international operations we operate in the global marketplace and face risks associated with worldwide operations 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our sales were derived from customers in international markets 
we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant majority of our total revenue in future years 
we have manufacturing facilities outside the united states in the united kingdom  malaysia and china 
we are subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations  including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world 
in addition  the management of global operations subjects us to risks associated with trade balance issues  currency controls  differences in local business and cultural factors  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
although we did not experience any materially adverse effects from our international operations as a result of these types of factors in fiscal  one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
recent events and global disruptions could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results 
terrorist activities worldwide and hostilities in and between nation states  including the continuing hostilities and violence in iraq and the threat of future hostilities involving the united states and other countries  may cause uncertainty and instability in the overall state of the global economy or in the industries in which we operate 
we have no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations in either the united states or other regions of the world 
continued increases in oil prices  as well as spreading subprime mortgage failures  could also affect our operations 
pandemic illnesses that spread globally and or substantial natural disasters  as well as geopolitical events  may also affect our future costs  operating capabilities and revenues 
we have significant manufacturing operations in china and  as a result  are subject to risks 
since we began production in our assembly and test facility in suzhou  china in fiscal  the factory has increased its output 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political situation there 
our ability to operate in china may be adversely affected by changes in china s laws and regulations  including those relating to taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  property and other matters 
we believe that our operations in china are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that china s central or local governments will not impose new  stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures 
changes in the political environment or government policies could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement  increased taxation  restrictions on imports  import duties or currency revaluations 
in addition  a significant destabilization of relations between china and the united states could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations in china 
the chinese legal systems relating to foreign trade and intellectual property are relatively new and continue to evolve 
enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws may be inconsistent 
moreover  there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions 
we are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar and foreign currencies 
while we transact business primarily in us dollars  and most of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  a portion of our costs and revenues is denominated in other currencies  such as the euro  the japanese yen  pound sterling and certain other asian currencies 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our net sales  costs of goods sold and operating margins 
we have a program to hedge our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  but our hedging program may not be fully effective in preventing foreign exchange losses 
we are subject to export restrictions and laws affecting trade and investments 
as a global company headquartered in the united states  we are subject to us laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and related product information 
compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our operations or our sales in the recent past but could significantly limit them in the future 
we maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented  exposing us to legal liabilities 
we must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments 
although these restrictions and laws have not significantly restricted our operations in the recent past  there is a risk that they could in the future 
page of risk factors relating to sales and operations our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials  utilities  critical manufacturing equipment and third party manufacturing services 
our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available 
limited or delayed access to or increases in the cost of these items  or the inability to implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our results of operations 
we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits 
we depend on a limited number of third parties  most of whom are located outside of the united states  to perform these subcontracted functions 
we do not have long term contracts with all of these third parties 
reliance on these third parties involves risks  including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand 
although we did not experience any material difficulties with supplies or subcontractors in fiscal  we have had difficulties in the past and could experience them in the future 
a substantial portion of our sales are made to franchised distributors and the termination of a franchise agreement with one or more distributors could result in a negative impact on our business 
in fiscal  our distributors accounted for approximately percent of our sales  with two of our distributors accounting for percent of total sales 
distributors typically sell products from several of our competitors along with our products 
a significant reduction of effort to sell national products or the termination of one or more distributors may reduce our access to certain end customers and adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
the termination of a franchise agreement with a distributor could also result in the return of our inventory held by the distributor 
our profit margins may vary over time 
our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including decreases in our shipment volume  reductions in  or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix 
in addition  the competitive market environment in which we operate may adversely affect pricing for our products  although we try to emphasize higher margin products 
because we own most of our manufacturing capacity  a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed  including costs associated with depreciation expense 
in general  these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will result in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
we make forecasts of customer demand that may be inaccurate 
our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in any given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter s revenue forecast 
to be able to accommodate customer requests for shorter shipment lead times  we manufacture product based on customer forecasts 
these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions 
while we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable forecasts  if we inaccurately forecast customer demand  it could result in inadequate  excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins 
we are subject to warranty claims  product recalls and product liability 
we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards 
in the event of a warranty claim  we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected customer 
we maintain product liability insurance  but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims 
we may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers products containing one of our devices 
although costs or payments we have made in connection with warranty claims or product recalls in the past have not materially affected our results of operations and financial condition  they could in the future 
we may be harmed by natural disasters and other disruptions 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other disruptions 
our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
in the event of a major earthquake  or other natural or manmade disaster  we could experience loss of life of our employees  destruction of facilities or other business interruptions 
the operations of our suppliers could also be subject to natural disasters and other disruptions  which could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
we use third party freight firms for nearly all of our shipments from vendors page of and from our wafer manufacturing facilities to assembly and test sites and for shipments to customers of our final product 
this includes ground  sea and air freight 
any significant disruption of our freight shipments globally or in certain parts of the world  particularly where our operations are concentrated  would materially affect our operations 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance  but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all costs associated with such disasters and disruptions 
risk factors relating to r d  intellectual property and litigation we may experience delays in introducing new products or market acceptance of new products may be below our expectations 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the industries in which our primary customers operate 
as our customers evolve and introduce new products  our success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner by developing and introducing into the market new products that meet the needs of our customers 
we believe that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development  introduction and market acceptance of new analog products  is a key factor to successful growth and the ability to achieve strong financial performance 
successful development and introduction of these new products are critical to our ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
we will continue to invest resources to develop more highly integrated solutions and building block products  both primarily based on our analog capabilities 
we will continue to target applications such as wireless handsets  other portable devices and applications in other broad markets that require analog technology  especially in areas where analog technology can be used to achieve energy efficiencies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in timely developing and introducing successful new products  and a failure to bring new products to market may harm our operating results 
we also cannot assure you that products that may be developed in the future by our competitors will not render our products obsolete or non competitive 
our products are dependent on the use of intellectual property that we need to protect 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies  and have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  trademarks  mask works and copyrights in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited or not applied for in some countries 
some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the patents owned by us or numerous other patents which third parties license to us will not be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or licensed to other companies  or any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technologies  including technologies that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with our collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our collaborators will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of our research collaborations 
in addition  we may not be able to enforce these agreements globally 
some of our technologies have been licensed on a non exclusive basis from other companies  which may license such technologies to others  including our competitors 
if necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under patents or intellectual property rights claimed by others 
however  we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the semiconductor industry  are subject to legal claims 
we are involved in a variety of routine legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
further discussion of certain specific material legal proceedings we are involved with is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal claims will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  litigation is inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
an unfavorable resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
page of risk factors related to our debt increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on june   we announced that we would incur billion of indebtedness under a bridge credit facility to purchase shares of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase program 
we subsequently issued billion in senior unsecured notes and entered into a bank loan in the aggregate principal amount of billion to fully repay the indebtedness under the bridge credit facility 
as a result  our total liabilities at the end of the fiscal were billion  an increase of billion from the end of fiscal this increase from fiscal and any future increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation we have additional cash requirements in order to support the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes may be limited particularly in light of current credit market conditions  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required to  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms  if at all 
rises in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition 
an increase in prevailing interest rates has an immediate effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt  including the senior floating rate notes and bank debt  which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates on a quarterly basis 
although interest rates actually decreased in fiscal  any increased interest expense associated with increases in interest rates affects our cash flow and our ability to service our debt 
as a protection against rising interest rates  we may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
however  the other parties to the agreements may fail to perform or the terms may be unfavorable to us depending on rate movements 
risk factors relating to personnel and merger and acquisition activity we may not be able to attract or retain employees with skills necessary to remain competitive in our industry 
our continued success depends in part on the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel  including technical  marketing  management and staff personnel 
experienced personnel in the semiconductor industry  particularly in our targeted analog areas  are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully recruit and retain the key personnel we require 
we may pursue acquisitions  investments and divestitures that could harm our operating results and may disrupt our business 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments  alliances and acquisitions we consider necessary to gain access to key technologies that we believe will augment our existing technical capability and support our business model objectives 
acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
we may not be able to integrate and develop the technologies we acquire as expected 
if the page of technology is not developed in a timely manner  we may be unsuccessful in penetrating target markets 
with any acquisition there are risks that future operating results may be unfavorably affected by acquisition related costs  including in process r d charges and incremental r d spending 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic divestitures 
with any divestiture  there are risks that future operating results could be unfavorably impacted if targeted objectives  such as cost savings  are not achieved or if other business disruptions occur as a result of the divestiture or activities related to the divestiture 
risk factors relating to tax and environmental regulations we may be affected by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a global company  our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and complex analyses and significant judgment are required to determine worldwide tax liabilities 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments in various jurisdictions where we operate 
we may receive future notices of assessments and the amounts of these assessments or our failure to favorably resolve such assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax benefits will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions  or if there is a significant change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  which would cause an increase in our effective tax rate 
a significant increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to many environmental laws and regulations 
increasingly stringent environmental regulations restrict the amount and types of materials that can be released from our operations into the environment 
while the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically  compliance with these and any future regulations could require significant capital investments in pollution control equipment or changes in the way we make our products 
in addition  because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our manufacturing processes  we are subject to risks of liabilities and claims  regardless of fault  resulting from accidental releases  including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines 
the following should also be considered we currently are remediating past contamination at some of our sites  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at a number of superfund sites where we or our predecessors disposed of wastes in the past  and significant regulatory and public attention on the impact of semiconductor operations on the environment may result in more stringent regulations  further increasing our costs

wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal we expect our captive manufacturing capacity together with our third party subcontract manufacturing arrangements to be adequate to supply our needs in the foreseeable future 
our assembly and test functions are performed primarily in southeast asia and china 
our assembly and test facilities are located in melaka  malaysia and in suzhou  china 
in july  we announced a plan to close our assembly and test facility in singapore and consolidate its production volume into our aforementioned test facilities in malaysia and china 
we successfully completed closure of the singapore facility by the end of the first quarter of fiscal and sold the facility in june we currently do not anticipate any additional facility closures in the foreseeable future 
our principal administrative and research facilities are located in santa clara  california 
our regional headquarters for worldwide marketing and sales are located in santa clara  california  munich  germany  tokyo  japan  and kowloon  hong kong 
we maintain local sales offices and sales service centers in various locations and countries throughout our four business regions 
we also operate small design facilities in various locations in the us  including calabasas  california longmont  colorado san diego  california federal way  washington norcross  georgia south portland  maine fort collins  colorado phoenix  arizona tucson  arizona grass valley  california rochester  new york indianapolis  indiana salem  new hampshire design facilities are also operated at overseas locations including china  estonia  finland  germany  india  italy  japan  malaysia  the netherlands  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we own our manufacturing facilities and our corporate headquarters 
in general  we lease most of our design facilities and our sales and administrative offices 
as described in the business section under item of this form k  our manufacturing operations are centralized and shared among our product line business units  and no individual facility is dedicated to a specific operating segment 
we believe our facilities are suitable and have adequate capacity for our current needs 
further  we believe space and capacity will be available if needed in the future 
page of item legal proceedings we currently are a party to various legal proceedings  including those noted below 
while we believe that the ultimate outcome of these various proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from selling one or more products 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs  and future periods 
tax matters the internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for fiscal years through and on july  issued a notice of proposed adjustment seeking additional taxes of approximately million exclusive of interest for those years 
the issues giving rise to most of the proposed adjustments related to r d credits  inventory and depreciation deductions 
we contested the adjustments through the irs administrative process 
through that process  we agreed with the appeals office of the irs to settle the matter for the payment of additional taxes of approximately million exclusive of interest and this settlement was approved by the congressional joint committee on taxation in october interest computations totaling million were finalized by the irs in january all payments have been made and the matter is now completed 
we are also undergoing tax audits at several international locations and from time to time our tax returns are audited in the united states by state agencies and at international locations by local tax authorities 
we believe we have made adequate tax payments and or accrued adequate amounts such that the outcome of these audits will have no material adverse effect on our financial statements 
environmental matters we have been named to the national priorities list superfund for our santa clara  california site and we have completed a remedial investigation feasibility study with the regional water quality control board rwqcb  which is acting as agent for the epa 
we have agreed in principle with the rwqcb on a site remediation plan  and we are conducting remediation and cleanup efforts at the site 
in addition to the santa clara site  we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party by international  federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement 
these designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement 
these claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions 
in many cases  the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified and the claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us 
we have also retained responsibility for environmental matters connected with businesses we sold in fiscal and  but we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings relating to those liabilities 
other in november  a derivative action was filed in the us district court in delaware against us  fairchild semiconductor international  inc and sterling holding company  llc  by mark levy  a fairchild stockholder 
the action was brought under section b of the exchange act and the rules issued under that act by the sec 
the plaintiff seeks disgorgement of alleged short swing insider trading profits 
we had originally acquired fairchild common and preferred stock in march at the time we disposed of the fairchild business 
prior to its initial public offering in august  fairchild had amended its certificate of incorporation to provide that all fairchild preferred stock would convert automatically to common stock upon completion of the initial public offering 
as a result  our shares of preferred stock converted to common stock in august plaintiff has alleged that our acquisition of common stock through the conversion constituted an acquisition that should be matched against our sale in january of fairchild common stock for purposes of computing short swing trading profits 
the action seeks to recover from us on behalf of fairchild alleged recoverable profits of approximately million 
the case has completed discovery in the district court and we filed a motion for summary judgment in june the sec proposed clarifying amendments to its section b rules in june which we believe are dispositive of the case and the sec adopted the rule amendments in august oral argument on the briefing ordered by the district court on whether it should apply the sec rule amendments to the case was held in november in february  the district court granted our motion for summary judgment 
plaintiff has appealed this ruling  the argument on the appeal was heard in the third circuit court of appeals on march  and we are waiting for the court s ruling 
we intend to continue to contest the case through all available means 
in september  itech group  inc itech brought suit against us in california superior court alleging a number of contract and tort claims related to a software license agreement we entered into earlier in and the proposed page of sale of one of our business units 
at the trial which began in may the jury in the case found for itech on claims of breach of contract  promissory fraud and unjust enrichment  awarding plaintiff compensatory damages of approximately thousand and punitive damages of million 
in post trial motions heard by the court in july  the court affirmed the verdict for compensatory damages  awarded attorneys fees to itech of approximately thousand and reduced the punitive damages to million and judgment was entered in those amounts in august we appealed the case and the california appeals court issued an unpublished opinion in december  reversing the trial court judgment and remanding the case for re trial or other disposition 
after the opinion of the appeals court had become final  we paid plaintiff s counsel attorneys fees of approximately thousand  representing the attorneys fees originally awarded at trial  plus interest and additional fees on appeal 
the case was settled in october shortly before retrial that was scheduled to begin in november under the settlement  we paid million to itech in exchange for a release of all claims related to the litigation and dismissal of the case 
the settlement amount has been paid  the case has been dismissed and the matter is now concluded 
in april  lsi corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary agere systems inc collectively lsi instituted an action in the united states international trade commission itc  naming us and other respondents in an action seeking an exclusion preventing importation into the us of semiconductor integrated circuit devices and products made by methods alleged to infringe an lsi patent on the use of tungsten metallization in semiconductor manufacturing 
lsi also filed a companion case against the same parties in the us district court for the eastern district of texas seeking unspecified amounts of monetary damages trebled because of the alleged willful infringement  royalties  attorneys fees  costs and an injunction against further infringement 
since the initiation of both actions  five other parties have been named as respondents defendants in the respective actions 
the action in the us district court has been stayed pending the outcome of the itc action 
although no hearing date has been set yet in the itc action  it is expected that a hearing will occur in early calendar we intend to contest both actions through all available means 
in may  etool development  inc and etool patent holdings corporation collectively etool brought suit in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that our webench online design tools infringe an etool patent and seeking an injunction and unspecified amounts of monetary damages trebled because of the alleged willful infringement  attorneys fees and costs 
we have filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity of the patent 
we intend to contest the case through all available means

we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof and disclaim any obligation to do so 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this form k for the year ended may  strategy and business we design  develop  manufacture and market a wide range of semiconductor products  most of which are analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
our goal is to be the premier provider of high performance  energy efficient analog and mixed signal solutions 
we are focused on the following providing high performance  analog intensive solutions that enable customers to effectively differentiate their products  targeting our investments on high growth and high return markets  particularly by leveraging our strengths in creating energy efficient circuits and solutions  many of which will fall under our powerwise brand  strengthening and deepening our relationships with customers  using our proprietary technologies to create and maintain our market leading solutions  and consistently delivering superior returns on invested capital to our shareholders 
a large portion of our sales comes from analog products that are classified within the standard linear categories as defined by the wsts 
beyond the standard linear categories  we also sell analog systems and subsystems that can be more specifically targeted at various applications 
we look to create analog intensive solutions that provide more energy efficiency  greater portability  better audio  sharper images and higher performance in electronic systems 
energy efficiency is our overarching theme and our powerwise products enable systems that consume less power  extend battery life and generate less heat 
our leading edge products include power management circuits  audio and operational amplifiers  display drivers  communication interface products and data conversion solutions 
approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal came from our analog segment  compared to approximately percent in fiscal and approximately percent in fiscal for more information on our business  see part i  item  business  in this form k for the fiscal year ended may  critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments a revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement typically in the form of a purchase order  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales were made to distributors in fiscal  compared to approximately percent in fiscal and page of approximately percent in fiscal we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resale pricing and volume  price protection for inventory and scrap allowances 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates by geography and product family  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  and other related factors 
actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates  and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to our operating results 
service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
these revenues are included in net sales and totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal certain intellectual property income is classified as revenue if it meets specified criteria established by company policy that defines whether it is considered a source of income from our primary operations 
these revenues are included in net sales and totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal all other intellectual property income that does not meet the specified criteria is not considered a source of income from primary operations and is therefore classified as a component of other operating income  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
intellectual property income is recognized when the license is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and remaining obligations are perfunctory or inconsequential to the other party 
b valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the total carrying value of our inventory is reduced for any difference between cost and estimated market value of inventory that is determined to be obsolete or unmarketable  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
reductions in carrying value are deemed to establish a new cost basis 
inventory is not written up if estimates of market value subsequently improve 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reasonable estimates 
the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory has been materially consistent with previously estimated write downs we have recorded 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are intended to identify any difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is used as a measure of market for purposes of evaluating lower of cost or market and is determined as the selling price of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
c impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired  patents and technology licenses 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset  significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions  and page of current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting units containing goodwill 
our reporting units are based on our operating segments as defined under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units 
as of may  our reporting units containing goodwill include our advanced power  asic telecom  data conversion  infrastructure power products  interface  mobile devices power products  non audio amplifier and performance power products business units  all of which are operating segments within our analog reportable segment 
the estimates we use in evaluating goodwill are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions for these business units fail to materialize as anticipated  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
d income taxes we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the enacted tax rate expected to be applied when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases become deductible 
in determining a valuation allowance  we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
we currently have a valuation allowance that has been established primarily against the reinvestment and investment tax credits related to our operation in malaysia  as we have concluded that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the uncertainty of sufficient taxable income in malaysia beyond the foreseeable future 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based on historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods that the deferred tax assets are deductible 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the united states and international jurisdictions or changes in our tax structure may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust the existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we currently have recorded  such an adjustment could have a material impact on the tax expense for the fiscal year 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
although fasb interpretation no 
fin  which we adopted at the beginning of fiscal  provides further clarification on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  the new threshold and measurement attribute prescribed by fin will continue to require significant judgment by management 
if the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties is different from what we have currently estimated  this could have a material impact on income tax expense 
page of e share based compensation we measure and record compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
we provide share based awards to our employees  executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee equity  stock option  stock purchase and restricted stock plans 
the fair value of stock option and stock purchase equity awards is measured at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
in determining fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  management is required to make certain estimates of the key assumptions such as expected life  expected volatility  dividend yields and risk free interest rates 
the estimates of these key assumptions involve judgment regarding subjective future expectations of market price and trends 
the assumptions used in determining expected life and expected volatility have the most significant effect on calculating the fair value of share based awards 
when we began to record compensation expense for share based payment awards at the beginning of fiscal  we used the simplified method specified by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
to determine the expected life of stock options 
for all options granted after december   we determine expected life based on historical stock option exercise experience for the last four years  adjusted for our expectation of future exercise activity 
expected volatility is based on implied volatility  as management has determined that implied volatility better reflects the market s expectation of future volatility than historical volatility 
if we were to determine that another method to estimate these assumptions was more reasonable than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these assumptions were to be prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value for our share based awards could change significantly 
if the expected volatility and or expected life were increased under our assumptions  then the black scholes computation of fair value would also increase  thereby resulting in higher compensation costs being recorded 
sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant 
our estimate of forfeitures is based on our historical activity  which we believe is indicative of expected forfeitures 
in subsequent periods if the actual rate of forfeitures differs from our estimate  the forfeiture rates may be revised  as necessary 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on share based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
we also grant performance share units to executive officers that require us to estimate expected achievement of performance targets over a two year performance period 
this estimate involves judgment regarding future expectations of various financial performance measures such as those described in the overview section below 
if our estimate of the level of financial performance measures expected to be ultimately achieved changes  the related share based compensation expense may be significantly increased or reduced in the period that our estimate changes 
overview throughout fiscal  we continued to focus on providing leading edge analog solutions with a large portion of our sales classified within the analog standard linear categories  which the wsts defines as amplifiers  data converters  regulators and references power management products  and interface products 
in fiscal  approximately percent of our total net sales came from our analog segment  compared to approximately percent in fiscal and approximately percent in fiscal we believe that the success we have experienced in these markets has been driven by our understanding of the analog markets and our circuit design capabilities  especially as they pertain to energy efficiency that is enabled by our products 
our success has also been due to our innovative packaging and proprietary analog process technology  as well as our comprehensive manufacturing supply and logistics network 
net sales in fiscal were lower than net sales in fiscal during the first half of fiscal  we experienced sequential quarterly growth in sales for each of the first two quarters as demand for our new analog products increased  particularly in the wireless handset and personal mobile device markets 
however  by the third quarter of fiscal our sales declined nearly percent from the second quarter of fiscal due to a combination of lower demand in the wireless handset market and holiday seasonality 
net sales improved in the last quarter of fiscal  as new orders increased sequentially by percent over the third quarter of fiscal although net sales in fiscal were lower compared to fiscal  our gross margin of percent was higher than fiscal gross margin of percent 
our performance in gross margin percentage is attributable to continuing improvement in manufacturing efficiencies and execution relative to the level of factory utilization  as well as page of improvements in our sales mix of higher value analog products 
we continue to direct our research and development investments on high value growth areas in analog markets and applications  with particular focus on power management and energy efficiency 
in reviewing our performance  we consider several key financial measures 
when reviewing our net sales performance  we look at sales growth rates  new order rates including turns orders  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter  blended average selling prices  sales of new products and market share 
we define new products as those introduced within the last three years 
we gauge our operating income performance based on gross margin trends  product mix  blended average selling prices  factory utilization rates and operating expenses relative to sales 
we are focused on growing our earnings per share over time while generating a consistently high return on invested capital by concentrating on operating income  working capital management  capital expenditures and cash management 
we determine return on invested capital based on net operating income after tax divided by invested capital  which generally consists of total assets reduced by goodwill and non interest bearing liabilities 
we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock during fiscal for  million 
of these shares  million shares were repurchased through the billion accelerated stock repurchase program announced in june the other million shares were repurchased in the open market for million in connection with two million stock repurchase programs  one announced in march and the other in june the stock repurchase activity is one element of our overall program to deliver a consistently high return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value over time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the stock repurchase program and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the debt we incurred as part of the accelerated stock repurchase program 
we also continued with the dividend program in fiscal  during which time we paid a total of million in cash dividends 
on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  the following table and discussion provide an overview of our operating results for fiscal years  and years ended in millions may  change may  change may  net sales operating income as a of net sales net income as a of net sales net income for fiscal includes million for severance and restructuring expenses related to a factory modernization effort announced in january and a workforce reduction announced in april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income for fiscal also includes a charge of million related to settlement of a legal matter see note to the consolidated financial statements  a gain of million from the sale of the singapore plant assets see note to the consolidated financial statements and other operating income of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges and credits are all pre tax amounts 
income tax expense for fiscal includes million of tax benefits that arose primarily from the resolution of international tax inquiries  the expiration of statute of limitations associated with international tax matters and costs related to the manufacturing restructure and workforce reduction actions 
net income for fiscal included an in process r d charge of million related to the acquisition of xignal see note to the consolidated financial statements  severance and restructuring expenses of million that mostly related to our scotland and texas manufacturing facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements and other operating income of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these charges and credits are all pre tax amounts 
income tax expense for fiscal included a tax benefit of approximately million from the retroactive reinstatement to january  of the us federal r d tax credit under the tax relief and health care act of enacted into law during fiscal of the million  million was related to fiscal r d expenses page of and million was related to fiscal r d expenses 
the tax benefit from the federal r d tax credit was partially offset by the non deductible nature of the in process r d charge related to the xignal acquisition 
net income for fiscal included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses arising from cost reduction actions taken during the year see note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill impairment losses of million see note to the consolidated financial statements  gain from sale of businesses of million see note to the consolidated financial statements and other operating income of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
all of these charges and credits are pre tax amounts 
income tax expense for fiscal included million of tax expense related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under provisions of the american jobs creation act of net sales years ended in millions may  change may  change may  analog segment as a of net sales all others as a of net sales total net sales the chart above and the following discussion are based on our reportable segments described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
although net sales for the company in total were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  net sales for our analog segment in fiscal were slightly higher than in fiscal due to increased sales for new analog products  primarily in the wireless handset and personal mobile device markets where we have experienced growth associated with feature rich devices that utilize our analog solutions to enable features as well as enhance power efficiency and battery life 
unit shipments of analog segment products were percent lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  but this decline in volume was favorably offset by higher blended average selling prices that increased percent in fiscal over fiscal the increase in blended average selling prices was driven mainly by improved sales mix from higher value analog products 
within the analog segment  net sales from our power management business units in fiscal grew percent compared to fiscal net sales from our amplifiers business units including audio amplifier products in fiscal also grew percent compared to fiscal however  net sales from our interface and data conversion business units decreased in fiscal by percent and percent  respectively  compared to fiscal the decline in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for other operating business units included in the category described as all others was primarily driven by a significant decrease in foundry sales associated with previously sold businesses 
this decline was consistent with our original plans and expectations 
for fiscal  net sales in our geographic regions compared to fiscal decreased by percent in the americas and percent in japan  while remaining relatively flat in the asia pacific region and increasing by percent in europe 
regional sales as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were higher in the asia pacific region at percent and europe at percent  while dropping to percent in the americas and percent in japan 
the reported amount of net sales in us dollars related to foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the pound sterling  euro and japanese yen all strengthened over the fiscal year against the dollar 
however  the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales reported in us dollars was minimal since less than a quarter of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currency and we have hedging programs intended to minimize the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
analog segment sales in fiscal in total were lower than sales in fiscal due to lower shipments to distributors  who reduced their inventories during the year  and lower demand from customers  who were also affected by page of oversupply of inventory  as well as decelerating growth rates in end demand 
unit shipments in our analog segment were lower by percent in fiscal compared to fiscal notwithstanding the lower volume  blended average selling prices increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven mainly by improved sales mix from our analog standard linear product portfolio 
comparing analog segment sales in fiscal with those in fiscal  net sales from our data conversion business unit grew percent  which was more than offset by a decrease of percent in net sales from the amplifiers business unit including audio amplifier products and a decrease of percent in net sales from the interface business unit 
during this period  sales from our power management business units were relatively flat 
for the other operating business units included in the all others category  the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by a significant decline in foundry sales associated with previously sold businesses 
for fiscal  net sales in our geographic regions compared to fiscal declined by percent in japan and percent in the asia pacific region  while remaining fairly flat in the americas and increasing by percent in europe 
regional sales as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were higher in the americas at percent and in europe at percent  while dropping to percent in the asia pacific region and percent in japan 
the reported amount of net sales in us dollars related to foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal was favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in euro and pound sterling which strengthened over the fiscal year against the dollar and more than offset the unfavorable effect of the japanese yen as it weakened over the fiscal year against the dollar 
however  the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales reported in us dollars was minimal since less than a quarter of our total net sales in fiscal were denominated in foreign currency and we had hedging programs intended to minimize the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
gross margin years ended in millions may  change may  change may  net sales cost of sales gross margin as a of net sales we achieved a higher gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal despite lower sales in fiscal compared to fiscal this higher gross margin percentage was due to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and execution relative to the level of factory utilization combined with improved product mix of higher margin analog standard linear products 
as part of that product mix improvement  our blended average analog selling prices in fiscal were higher compared to fiscal our analog product portfolio has continued to improve through active efforts to increase the portion of our business that comes from high value  high performance analog products that are more proprietary in nature 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal gross margin in fiscal includes share based compensation expense of million compared to million in fiscal year the increase in the gross margin percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely driven by improved product mix of higher margin analog standard linear products 
a decline in foundry sales from the businesses we had previously sold which carried much lower gross margins also contributed to the improvement in gross margin percentage during fiscal manufacturing efficiencies we began to achieve in connection with the conversion and upgrading of our wafer manufacturing capacity in scotland and texas also aided our ability to sustain a higher gross margin percentage despite a significant drop in factory utilization in fiscal wafer fabrication capacity utilization based on wafer starts was percent for fiscal compared to percent for fiscal page of research and development years ended in millions may  change may  change may  research and development as a of net sales although r d expenses in fiscal were at a comparable level to r d expenses in fiscal  we have continued to increase our investment in research and development on analog product areas 
share based compensation expense included in r d expense for fiscal was million compared to fiscal which was million 
this decrease in share based compensation expenses more than offset higher spending in fiscal resulting from the acquisition of xignal in january  as well as higher payroll and employee benefits expenses 
we are continuing to concentrate our research and development spending on analog products and underlying analog capabilities such as dc to dc power conversion  signal conditioning  high speed amplification and low power analog to digital conversion 
during fiscal  research and development spending in the analog segment was percent higher compared to fiscal and we continue to invest in the development of new analog products that can serve applications in a wide variety of end markets such as personal mobile devices  communications infrastructure  alternative energy  industrial and medical 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
the increase in r d expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely due to the inclusion of share based compensation expense in the amount of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r beginning in fiscal during fiscal  research and development spending in the analog segment was percent higher than fiscal the in process r d charge of million related to the acquisition of xignal in january is not included in r d expenses for fiscal  and it is reported as a separate component of operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
selling  general and administrative years ended in millions may  change may  change may  selling  general and administrative as a of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal include a million credit that represents a reduction in the liability associated with the employee deferred compensation plan due to a decline in the market value of the employees corresponding investment assets for the plan

see the discussion of a corresponding million loss on investments due to the decline in the market value of the employees investment assets described in the paragraph  other non operating income expense  net 
excluding the effect of this credit  sg a expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher payroll and employee benefit expenses  which more than offset a decrease in share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense for fiscal included in sg a expenses was million compared to million in fiscal we focus on managing our cost structure  including sg a expenses  in line with our overall business model objectives  as well as current business conditions 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the inclusion of share based compensation expense in the amount of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r beginning in fiscal theincrease from the adoption of share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r was partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal page of severance and restructuring expenses related to cost reduction programs our fiscal results include a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses 
in january  we announced that we would dispose of certain manufacturing equipment and reduce the workforce at our wafer fabrication facilities as part of an action to modernize our facilities and rationalize our capacity 
in connection with this action  we eliminated approximately positions  primarily at our manufacturing plants located in arlington  texas  south portland  maine  and greenock  scotland 
as a result of this action  we recorded a charge of million 
in april  we announced a workforce reduction that eliminated approximately positions across the company  primarily in product line and support functions as part of our efforts to strategically align resources in connection with our focus on accelerating revenue growth in key market areas that require better power management and energy efficiency 
as a result of this action  we recorded a charge of million 
in addition  severance and restructuring expenses for fiscal year include a recovery of million for the release of the residual accrued balance of a lease obligation that has been settled 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges  as well as a discussion of fiscal activity related to previously announced actions 
our fiscal results included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses arising from actions in scotland and texas related to the conversion and upgrading of our wafer manufacturing capacity in those facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges 
our fiscal results included a net charge of million for severance and restructuring expenses arising from cost reduction actions taken during fiscal these actions included the phased closure of our assembly and test plant in singapore  steps to reduce indirect manufacturing costs at our texas plant and additional cost reduction actions primarily related to the reorganization of our product lines into two groups signal path group and power management group originally announced at the end of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges 
charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition during fiscal of xignal  we allocated million of the total purchase price to the value of in process r d 
this amount was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for the technology 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of the acquisition 
gain from sale of businesses as part of our actions to reposition toward a higher value portfolio  we have disposed of businesses that did not align with our business model 
our fiscal results included a gain of million upon the completion in april of the sale of a small business unit that was developing high definition products hdp and a gain of million from the sale completed in june of our cordless business unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these transactions 
goodwill impairment loss in fiscal and  no impairment losses were identified from our annual impairment evaluations for goodwill  nor did any events or changes in circumstances arise during either fiscal year that indicated our carrying values of goodwill were not recoverable 
our fiscal results included a million impairment loss for goodwill in our hdp reporting unit  which was recorded when we evaluated the business at the time we decided to sell it 
in fiscal  we also recorded an additional million impairment loss for goodwill in our crt reporting unit upon completing our annual evaluation of goodwill 
the fair values of the hdp and crt reporting units were determined using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated our estimates of future sales and costs for the business units 
page of interest income years ended in millions may  may  may  interest income the decrease in interest income for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to lower interest rates on lower average cash balances 
the increase in interest income in fiscal over fiscal was due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 
interest expense years ended in millions may  may  may  interest expense the increase in interest expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to substantially higher debt balances associated with the debt transactions completed in june and july as part of the financing for our accelerated stock repurchase see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion 
since some of our overall debt has floating interest rates  changes in the reference interest rates that correspond to that debt will affect future interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower interest rates 
other non operating income expense  net years ended in millions may  may  may  gain loss on investments share in net losses of equity method investments charitable contribution total other non operating income expense  net the components of other non operating expense  net  are primarily derived from activities related to investment assets 
the loss on investments of million in fiscal represents a decline in the market value of the investment assets held in the trust for the employee deferred compensation plan  which is partially offset by a million gain from other investments not associated with the deferred compensation plan 
see the discussion of a corresponding million credit included in sg a expenses pertaining to the liability that relates to the deferred compensation plan investments described in the paragraph  selling  general and administrative 
the gain on investments in fiscal reflects the change in unrealized holding gains and losses from trading securities  which is partially offset by impairment losses on non marketable investments 
the gain on investments in fiscal reflects the sale of shares in available for sale securities and in a non publicly traded company  as well as the change in unrealized holdings gains from trading securities  offset by an impairment loss on a non marketable investment 
income tax expense years ended in millions may  may  may  income tax expense effective tax rate page of the effective tax rate was lower for fiscal compared to due to an increase in tax benefits recognized that arose primarily from the resolution of international tax inquiries and the expiration of statute of limitations associated with international tax matters 
the effective tax rate for fiscal includes a tax benefit of approximately million from the retroactive reinstatement to january  of the us federal r d tax credit under the tax relief and health care act of enacted into law during the third quarter of fiscal of the million  million was related to fiscal r d expenses and million was related to fiscal r d expenses 
the tax benefit from the federal r d tax credit was partially offset by the non deductible nature of the in process r d charge related to the xignal acquisition 
the fiscal effective tax rate was also lower than the rate for fiscal primarily because income tax expense in fiscal included incremental tax expense of million related to the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings under provisions of the american jobs creation act of and million related to discrete transactions recorded during fiscal that had higher effective tax rates 
those discrete transactions included cost reduction and restructuring activities associated with the announced closure of the singapore plant and the sale of the cordless business 
we adopted fin effective at the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect of applying fin was a million increase to retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal historically  we had classified unrecognized tax benefits as current income taxes payable 
under fin  we now classify unrecognized tax benefits as long term income taxes payable except to the extent we anticipate cash payment within the next year 
any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate 
during the preparation of our fiscal financial statements  we identified an understatement in net deferred tax assets relating to basis differences in fixed assets 
the understatement occurred in our fiscal income tax provision when we released a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets that excluded million 
as a result  our income tax benefit and net income in fiscal were each understated by million  and basic and diluted earnings per share were understated by and  respectively 
we concluded that these errors were not material to any prior year financial statements under the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality 
although the errors were and continue to be immaterial to prior periods  because of the significance of an out of period correction in the current year  we applied the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  and revised the prior year financial statements to correct the understatement of deferred tax assets 
as a result  the fiscal beginning retained earnings increased by million from the additional release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
the corresponding adjustments increased current deferred tax assets by million and non current deferred tax assets by million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax assets 
our ability to utilize these tax assets is dependent on future results and it is therefore possible that we will be unable to ultimately realize some portion or all of the benefits of these recognized deferred tax assets 
this could result in additions to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and an increase to tax expense 
share based compensation expense beginning in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair value 
we provide share based awards to our employees  executive officers and directors through various equity compensation plans including our employee equity  stock option  stock purchase and restricted stock plans 
for further detail and a description of these plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for the year ended may  we applied the modified prospective transition method to adopt sfas no 
r and accordingly  operating results for periods prior to fiscal have not been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in the year we adopted sfas no 
r  the effect on operating results in fiscal was a decrease in net income of million and a decrease to basic earnings per share of and diluted earnings per share of from the amounts they would have been under the previous accounting standard 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we measured compensation expense in accordance with the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and reported pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share required by sfas page of no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the fair value of awards for our stock option and stock purchase plans is measured at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of certain key assumptions 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed the method used to determine the assumption for expected volatility 
beginning in fiscal  the expected volatility assumption is based on implied volatility  as management has determined that implied volatility better reflects the market s expectation of future volatility than historical volatility 
prior to fiscal  we used our historical stock price volatility in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
for purposes of our pro forma information 
this change results in a lower volatility assumption for fiscal compared to fiscal see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of and updates regarding our share based compensation plans and the effect of share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million fiscal the decrease in expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is mainly due to the drop off of higher compensation expense from stock options granted prior to fiscal that was determined based on using historical volatility 
the expense from these stock options diminishes as they become fully vested 
foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities during fiscal was concentrated in uk pound sterling  malaysian ringgit and chinese rmb 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign currency denominated revenue is limited to the japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is at times hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
at some of our international locations  we maintain defined benefit pension plans that operate in accordance with local statutes and practices 
in fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  which requires the recognition on the consolidated balance sheet of the funded status for defined benefit pension plans 
upon implementation  we remeasured the ending funded status of our plans using their historical exchange rates 
in fiscal  we determined that  consistent with the underlying principles of sfas no 
 the ending balance of the funded status as of may  and may  should reflect the remeasurement of those balances using the current exchange rates at the respective balance sheet dates 
therefore  for the fiscal form k  we have revised the fiscal balance to reflect remeasurement using the current exchange rate at may  this resulted in an increase in other non current liabilities of million 
the corresponding offsets increased accumulated other comprehensive loss by million and deferred tax assets by million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
approximately million of our long term debt has floating interest rates whereby an increase in the reference interest rate increases our interest expense and likewise  a decrease in the reference interest rate decreases our interest expense 
at our current debt levels  a change in the london interbank offered rate  or libor  of one percentage point would result in a corresponding change in our interest expense of up to approximately million annually 
although interest rates decreased in fiscal  there is no guarantee that rates will continue to decrease 
moreover  increases in interest expense would be mitigated by a similar increase in interest income earned from our large cash portfolio 
the remainder of our long term debt totaling approximately million has fixed interest rates and is not affected by changes in interest rates 
a series of decreases in interest rates has a significant effect on the amount of interest income we earn from our cash portfolio due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio 
at the same time  interest expense page of would be positively affected since as noted above  a portion of our long term debt has floating interest rates 
a significant portion of the floating interest rate debt can be repaid at any time without incurring prepayment penalties 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  pound sterling  euro and various other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of these potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed as of may liquidity and capital resources years ended in millions may  may  may  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used by financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the primary factors contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  and are described below during fiscal  cash from operating activities was generated by net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation expense and a positive impact from changes in working capital components 
changes in working capital that had a positive effect are attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the accrual of interest from the long term debt and decreases in inventories and other assets 
the decrease in other current assets primarily reflects the refund of certain operating lease deposits upon exercising the option to purchase the related equipment 
this was partially offset by a decrease in other non current liabilities primarily due to a contribution we made to one of our defined benefit pension plans 
in fiscal  cash from operating activities was positively affected by net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation expense 
this was partially offset by a negative impact from changes in working capital components  primarily caused by a significant decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses that was partially offset by decreases in receivables and inventories 
in fiscal  cash from operating activities was generated primarily from net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization and the tax benefit associated with stock options combined with a positive impact from changes in working capital components 
the primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal was the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  mainly representing the purchase of machinery and equipment  which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
the primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal was for investment in property  plant and equipment of million  mainly representing the purchase of machinery and equipment  and a business acquisition  net of cash acquired for million 
these amounts were offset by the sale and maturity of available for sale securities of million 
the major use of cash for investing activities during fiscal was for investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for the purchase of machinery and equipment  which was partially offset by the proceeds of million from the sale of our cordless and high definition products businesses  million from the sale and maturity of available for sale securities and million from the sale of investments 
the primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for  million  which includes million shares of our common stock repurchased under the billion accelerated share repurchase program 
the remaining shares were repurchased in the open market 
we also used cash for financing activities for the payments of million for cash dividends  million of principal payments on page of the bank term loan and million related to tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for net share settlements 
these amounts were partially offset by cash proceeds of  million net of million issuance costs that came from new debt  which included billion unsecured senior notes issued through a public offering in june and a million unsecured credit facility with a consortium of banks funded in july cash proceeds also included million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
financing activities in fiscal also include an additional billion of cash received from the unsecured bridge credit facility in june that was used to finance the accelerated stock repurchase and an additional payment of billion for its full repayment after completing the billion unsecured senior note offering in june and the million unsecured credit facility with a consortium of banks in july the primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock in the open market for million  payments of million for cash dividends and million for software license obligations 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal was for the repurchase of million shares of our common stock in the open market for million 
we also used cash to pay million in cash dividends and million on software license obligations 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
as of may   we had a balance of million remaining available for future common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program announced in june on june   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock  which was paid on july  to shareholders of record at the close of business on june  we foresee continuing cash outlays for plant and equipment in fiscal  with our primary focus on new analog capabilities at our existing sites 
at the current time  we anticipate that our fiscal capital expenditures will be slightly higher than the fiscal amount 
we will continue to manage the level of capital expenditures relative to sales levels  capacity utilization and industry business conditions 
we expect that existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit and cash generated by operations  will be sufficient to finance the capital investments currently planned for fiscal  as well as the dividends paid in july  the authorized stock repurchase program  and principal and interest payments due on long term debt 
our cash and investment balances are dependent in part on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  significant declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of customer receivables 
since we no longer hold investments with maturities greater than days  we did not experience any major declines in our cash equivalents or marketable investments as a result of the current downturn in the financial markets 
however  major declines in financial markets could possibly cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments in the future

we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might be established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we do not believe we are materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

page of in december  the financial accounting standards board ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 collaborative arrangements 
the eitf addresses accounting for collaborative arrangement activities that are not conducted within a separate legal entity 
these collaborative arrangements are sometimes called virtual joint ventures 
applying the equity method of accounting to activities performed outside a separate legal entity by a virtual joint venture is prohibited 
revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with the collaborative arrangement should be presented gross or net by the collaborators based on criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and other applicable accounting literature 
payments to or from collaborators should be presented in the income statement based on the nature of the arrangement  the nature of the company s business and whether the payments are within the scope of other accounting literature 
other detail information related to the collaborative arrangement is also required to be disclosed 
the requirements under this eitf will be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence at the beginning of our fiscal we are currently analyzing the requirements of this eitf and have not yet determined its effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements 
these new standards represent the outcome of the fasb s joint project with the international accounting standards board and are intended to improve  simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  however  it retains the fundamental requirements of the former statement that the acquisition method of accounting previously referred to as the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business 
this statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest and to disclose those amounts on the face of the income statement 
it also aligns the reporting of noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries with the requirements in international accounting standard both sfas no 
r and sfas no 
are effective beginning in our fiscal sfas no 
r will be applied to business combinations that are consummated beginning in fiscal  and sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests  including any that arose before fiscal we are currently evaluating these statements and have not yet determined their effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board ratified eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
the eitf requires non refundable advance payments to acquire goods or pay for services that will be consumed or performed in a future period in conducting r d activities to be recorded as an asset and recognized as an expense when the r d activities are performed 
the eitf will be applied prospectively to new contractual arrangements entered into beginning in our fiscal we currently recognize these non refundable advanced payments as an expense upon payment 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook although overall sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal  sales of our new analog products increased  particularly in the wireless handset and personal mobile device markets where we have experienced growth opportunities over the past year due to positive market trends combined with our successful penetration into feature rich devices in those markets 
in the last quarter of fiscal  net sales also improved as new orders increased sequentially by percent over page of the third quarter of fiscal  reflecting activity from both our oem customers as well as our distributors 
a portion of the increase was attributable to a higher level of turns orders which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter compared to the preceding third quarter 
as we entered the first quarter of fiscal  our opening week backlog was higher than it was when we began the fourth quarter of fiscal distributor resales in our distribution channel were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal  driven by positive seasonal trends  while the number of weeks of inventory that distributors were carrying was down slightly 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we anticipate that distributor resales will be relatively comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal and overall oem activity is expected to remain stable with some amount of seasonality in certain regions due to summer holidays 
considering all factors  including those described above  we provided guidance for net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
however  if backlog orders are cancelled or if the currently anticipated level of turns orders is less than expected  we may not be able to achieve this projected level of sales 
we expect our gross margin percentage in the first quarter of fiscal to range from percent to percent 
our estimate includes approximately million of share based compensation expense included in cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal wafer fabrication utilization is expected to stay relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was percent 
however  if there are further declines in factory utilization or changes in the expected sales level or product mix  our gross margin percentage could be negatively impacted
