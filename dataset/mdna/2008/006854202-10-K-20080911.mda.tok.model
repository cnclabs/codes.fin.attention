item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the core of which are our motion controls systems  integrated vision guidance technology and application software  that are sold in combination with our own proprietary or our third parties robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
in addition  we provide a full complement of robotics services and support for our customers 
through sales to system integrators  original equipment manufacturer oem partners and end user companies  we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
our growth strategy focuses on four global vertical markets packaging  solar  medical and disk drive electronics  as well as on traditional industrial markets in europe  including automotive electronics and machine tool automation 
we believe these markets represent significant opportunity over the next several years for growth and product differentiation 
overview over the past several years we have experienced a significant shift in the composition and focus of our business as demand in the us automotive and industrial markets declined sharply due to deterioration in those industries  and demand in the global disk drive market decreased due to consolidation and ongoing deferment of capital investment 
to counter these trends and the related decline in our revenues  we adopted a strategy focusing on a few vertical markets where the use of automation is growing or is expected to grow 
the markets we have selected are packaging  solar  medical and disk drive electronics 
currently  we are focusing the majority of our investments on opportunities in the global packaging market and on the emerging solar market  as we believe these industries offer significant opportunity in both the near and long term 
in addition  we have continued to focus on the automotive and industrial markets in germany  which have remained robust 
over the longer term  we believe that demand in the disk drive electronics market will also grow 
because much of the demand for our products in recent periods has come from europe  over the past several quarters we have also intensified our efforts to strengthen our operational and sales capabilities in this region 
we believe europe will continue to be an important market for our products both in traditional sectors such as automotive electronics and in our target vertical markets 
to further diversify our revenue base and expand sales of our products for packaging and solar applications into additional geographies  during fiscal we added distribution capabilities in brazil and argentina through agreements with new channel partners  and in february  we added a distribution partner in korea 
in early fiscal  we signed our first distribution partner in india 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also launched new marketing programs to expand sales of our quattro robot  currently sold primarily in germany and france  into additional countries in europe as well as into asia 
to better address the needs of the packaging and emerging solar markets  in fiscal we introduced an important new robot to our portfolio  quattro  which offers industry leading speed and performance for high speed automation applications 
sales of quattro have helped drive adept s revenue growth in fiscal  and we believe the product will continue to be an important revenue driver 
the quattro robot is a unique kinematic licensed exclusively to adept and covered under patent protection in adept s key geographic markets 
additionally  in may  we introduced a new inverted scara robot  the adept cobra s  to address applications in the packaging market such as mechanical assembly  material handling and packaging of packaged goods 
as a result of our recent strategies  we experienced sales growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the composition of our sales has shifted to include a higher proportion of revenues from our target vertical markets of packaging  solar and medical  as well as a higher proportion of revenues from europe than from the united states and asia 

table of contents to augment our technical and sales capabilities in the medical and packaging markets  in the third quarter of fiscal we acquired cerebellum automation sas  a leader in specialized oem robotics and motion control solutions for medical and packaging applications 
our results for the third quarter and year ended june  include the operations of cerebellum 
to lower our expense base and more efficiently utilize our sales resources  at the end of fiscal we implemented a restructuring program  under which we reduced facility and headcount costs  consolidated development activities to fewer locations and realigned our us sales resources around our target vertical markets 
as a result  we reduced our quarterly expense rate by a significant amount  which we believe will help us to maintain profitability in the future and provide cash flows to invest into our target vertical markets 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the two year period ended june   each year therein referred to as fiscal and  reflecting requirements applicable to adept as a smaller reporting company 
unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of adept s financial condition and results of operations are based upon adept s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring expenses  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to present the financial statements on a consistent basis with current year presentation 
such reclassifications have not changed previously reported net income loss or stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  
table of contents inventories  warranties  capitalization of software development costs  deferred tax valuation allowance  foreign currency accounting  long lived assets and goodwill  valuation of stock based awards  and commitments and contingencies revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from adept facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on its historical warranty experience and managements best estimate of adept s warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectibility of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed  generally upon receipt of payment 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
adept s robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of software enabling tools and other software elements  which are embedded within our robot and controller products 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
we also sell optional software used to enhance capability of our products 
adept believes that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  and software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is probable and v the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
license revenue is recognized on shipment of the product provided that no significant vendor or post contract support obligations remain and that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by management 
insignificant vendor and post contract support obligations are accrued upon shipment of the licensed product 
for software that is installed and integrated by the customer  revenue is recognized upon shipment assuming functionality has already been proven in prior sales and there are no customizations that would cause a substantial acceptance risk 

table of contents service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on the revenue recognition policy for adept s component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned remanufactured robots and components 
adept receives parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or adept purchases surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with gaap as reflected in the sab  restructuring charges  impairments  and related issues  pronouncement requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned remanufactured or repaired robots is zero since adept does not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities materials and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within the services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
adept performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not generally request collateral from our customers 
however  adept may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on the greater of of consolidated accounts receivable or of consolidated accounts receivable more than days past due 
specific allowances are netted out of the respective receivable balances for purposes of calculating this additional allowance 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
the inventory valuation provisions are based on an excess and obsolete systems report  which captures all obsolete parts and products and all other inventory  which have quantities on hand in excess of one year s projected demand 
individual line item 
table of contents exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials control group and cost accounting function monitor the line item exceptions and make periodic adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at adept s discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with adept s approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 
deferred tax valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we have a net deferred tax asset and determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period that such determination was made 
foreign currency accounting 
adept applies sfas  foreign currency translation  with respect to our international operations  which include manufacturing  sales and service entities 
each of our non us operations uses its respective local currency as the functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
gains and losses realized from transactions  including intercompany balances not considered to be a permanent investment  denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
long lived assets and goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment with respect 
table of contents to future sales and production volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  foreign exchange rates and selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the intangibles and goodwill were acquired and valued in the third quarter of fiscal we test our intangible assets annually unless there are indications during an interim period that such assets may have become impaired 
we use our judgment in assessing whether intangible assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities may signal that an intangible asset has become impaired 
on january   adept acquired all outstanding common shares of cerebellum automation sas 
of the  of acquired intangible assets  all was assigned to cerebellum s approflex system software system  which has an approximate useful life of years 
the  of goodwill was assigned to the adept s robotics segment 
during the year  currency translation will affect the amounts recorded on the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the purchase price allocation for goodwill has been increased and includes the impact of recording a deferred tax liability of  related to the non tax deductible amortization of the acquired intangibles 
at the end of fiscal the remaining amount of intangible assets and goodwill related to cerebellum was  and  respectively 
in fiscal  adept concluded that the carrying value of goodwill related to its acquisitions of hexavision and meta was not supportable because the estimate of future cash flows related to these intangible assets was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such intangibles 
accordingly  adept wrote down the entire value of goodwill related to these acquisitions and took a charge of million under sfas for intangible asset impairment 
valuation of stock based awards 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
commitments and contingencies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate potential commitments and contingencies based on their anticipated outcome 
if we determine  after consideration of all known facts and consultation with legal counsel  that a loss related to the potential matter is neither probable or cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of issuance of our fiscal period end reports  we do not accrue for the potential liability 
if a loss is reasonably possible related to the matter  we will disclose the relevant facts of the matter along with an estimated loss amount or range if such amount or range can be reasonably estimated 
acquisitions from time to time  we may make acquisitions of products  technologies or other businesses 
on january   the company acquired all outstanding common shares of cerebellum automation sas 
the results of cerebellum s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
cerebellum  based in france  is a provider of custom robotics and motion control products and components 

table of contents the initial purchase price paid at closing  excluding all items tied to contingent employee retention compensation  amounted to  this included an initial cash payment of  accrued liabilities of  due within one year and paid direct costs of  additional contingent deferred cash consideration of  in cash and  payable in shares of adept common stock payable upon the first anniversary of the acquisition provided that certain employees remain employed by cerebellum  will be amortized monthly during the first year following the acquisition 
additional contingent consideration of  in cash and  payable in shares of adept common stock  which may be paid on the second anniversary provided that certain employees remain employed by cerebellum  will be amortized monthly during the second year following the acquisition months to post acquisition 
additionally  there are contingent amounts payable up to a maximum aggregate amount of  in adept common stock based on cerebellum s meeting certain revenue milestones in each of the first and second years after the date of the acquisition 
the amounts achieved will be added to goodwill upon realization of the associated revenue milestones 
in no event will adept issue common stock in an amount greater than of its outstanding stock at the time of the acquisition  and any amount which would exceed this maximum will instead be paid in cash 
in fiscal  we acquired a ownership interest in meta control technologies  inc meta  a provider of automation solutions  with the remaining ownership interest in meta being held in escrow for the benefit of one stockholder 
the acquisition agreement provided that adept would acquire all of these remaining shares in return for the provision of discounts and royalty payments to the stockholder and its affiliates of up to million through august but would  in any event and regardless of whether discounts were incurred or royalties paid  acquire of the stock of meta no later than august for no additional consideration 
no discounts and royalties were paid to the stockholder  and adept acquired the remaining equity of meta in august management decided to discontinue selling meta products in fiscal  other than a last time buy opportunity for the remaining customer for those products 
as a result of this decision to discontinue sales of all meta products  management has determined the entire amount of goodwill related to the acquisition of meta is fully impaired 
results of operations revenues the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by business segment for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by segment robotics revenues percentage of total revenues services and support revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues revenues 
revenues were million in fiscal  up million  or  from million in fiscal the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in sales in our robotics segment  offset by a decrease in sales in our service and support segment 

table of contents robotics segment revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal higher robotics revenues in fiscal were primarily the result of increased sales in europe of our viper and cobra products for applications in the automotive electronics and packaging markets  as well as sales of our new quattro robot in the packaging and emerging solar markets 
demand from the disk drive electronics market continued to be weak in fiscal sales to the medical market  comprised primarily of medical device manufacturing  were modestly higher in fiscal compared with the previous year 
services and support segment revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of remanufactured robotics to disk drive electronics manufacturers in the us and asia 
we expect service and support revenues will continue to comprise a similar percentage of sales as they have in fiscal the following table sets forth our annual revenues and year to year change in revenues by geographic region for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenue by geography united states revenues percentage of total revenues europe revenues percentage of total revenues asia revenues percentage of total revenues other countries revenues percentage of total revenues total international revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues our domestic revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced sales of both new robotic systems and refurbished robots to the disk drive electronics industry  offset by new sales of our quattro robots and increased sales of our viper and cobra robots for applications in our target packaging and solar markets 
us sales to the medical market were modestly higher in fiscal compared with the previous year  although still a small portion of our overall revenues 
our international revenues were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal higher international revenues primarily resulted from increased sales in europe  as well as increased sales in canada and new sales in south america shown collectively in the table above under other countries 
european sales were million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal  driven by continued strong demand from the automotive electronics and machine tool automation markets and increasing demand from the emerging solar market in germany  as well as increased demand in france for our products for packaging applications 
sales to other countries rose to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase was driven primarily by increased sales in canada for packaging applications 
sales also increased in south america as a result of new channel distribution agreements during fiscal asian sales increased 
table of contents in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal due to sales of quattro by our new korean distributor into the packaging industry 
gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin by business segment for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal was the result of several factors  including favorable product mix  primarily as a result of higher sales volumes of higher margin products in europe  where we have focused more of our sales efforts in the last several quarters  lower product costs as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce manufacturing overhead  reduce component costs and improve inventory management  and the recognition of software license revenue in the first half of which is not expected to continue at the same magnitude in the future and accounted for an incremental two percentage points of gross margin for the full fiscal year 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  changes in sales mix of products and or changes in operating costs operating expenses research  development and engineering fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenues  a decrease of from million  or of revenues  in fiscal included in r d expenses in fiscal was approximately  of incremental expenses from cerebellum  which adept acquired during the third quarter of the decrease in r d expense in fiscal was due primarily to restructuring actions taken by adept at the end of fiscal  including the consolidation of development activities into fewer locations  as well as lower expenses associated with the productization of the quattro robot  for which the majority of development was completed at the end of fiscal adept s capitalization of software costs was  in fiscal and  in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal change to fiscal s in thousands expenses percentage of revenue selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  professional fees arising from legal  auditing and other consulting services  as well as tradeshow participation and other marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses in compared with the prior year was primarily due to higher consulting and legal fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to various corporate activities including sarbanes oxley compliance  merger and acquisition related activities and our lease dispute  and also the accrual of certain corporate employee bonuses earned in fiscal  and higher marketing expenses related to programs to promote adept s solutions for the solar market in additional geographic regions 
additionally  included in sg a expenses in fiscal were approximately  of ongoing expenses to operate the newly acquired cerebellum  and approximately  of costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  discussed below 
offsetting higher sg a expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal were lower expenses in the first nine months of fiscal that resulted from reductions in headcount and facility space utilized as a result of our restructuring actions initiated at the end of fiscal during fiscal  we undertook and have now completed the actions necessary to become compliant with sarbanes oxley section with respect to our internal controls 
we recognized the majority of the related expense for these actions in our sg a expenses during fiscal we do expect continued expenses for our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts in fiscal amortization 
amortization of intangible assets was  in fiscal  compared with  in higher levels of amortization in fiscal resulted from the amortization of additional intangible assets acquired with the purchase of cerebellum in the third quarter of fiscal impairment of goodwill and intangibles 
as required under sfas  adept evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet at least annually and we record a charge for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
on january   adept acquired all outstanding common shares of cerebellum 
of the  of acquired intangible assets  all was assigned to cerebellum s approflex software system  which has an approximate useful life of years 
at the end of fiscal the remaining amount of intangible assets and goodwill related to cerebellum was  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill related to the acquisitions of hexavision and meta was not supportable because the estimate of future cash flows related to these intangible assets was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such intangibles 
accordingly  we wrote down the entire value of goodwill related to the acquisitions and recorded a charge of million for asset impairment 
stock compensation expense 
under the provisions of sfas r  we recorded stock based compensation expense of  in fiscal and million in fiscal for our stock option plans and espp 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the stock compensation expense in any of these years because of the extent of our net operating loss carry forwards 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock compensation expense 

table of contents crosslink settlement costs 
during fiscal  we recorded a million non cash expense paid in common shares associated with the settlement of our dispute with crosslink 
this was a one time expense and did not impact subsequent fiscal periods 
restructuring charges 
we recorded  in restructuring charges in primarily related to lease terminations 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in fiscal  primarily related to facility closure  lease termination and employee severance as part of our business restructuring at the end of june operating income loss 
operating income was million in fiscal compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal operating income in fiscal was the result of higher revenues and gross margin and lower operating expenses than in the previous year 
our operating loss in fiscal was the result of lower revenues and gross margin  combined with higher operating expenses  as well as a one time settlement expense related to crosslink  restructuring charges related to the restructuring implemented at the end of fiscal and impairment of goodwill 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  was  in fiscal  compared with interest income of  in fiscal the decrease in interest income  net in fiscal compared with the prior year was primarily due to lower interest rates on investment cash and securities in the fiscal period 
foreign currency transaction gain loss 
foreign currency transaction gains were  in fiscal and  in fiscal the foreign currency gains recorded resulted primarily from the settlement of previously considered permanent usd denominated inter company balances 
in  all the intercompany balances were considered permanent 
in  a portion of the debt was considered non permanent and was primarily settled  so the transactional gains and losses flowed through to other earnings 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal was  as compared with a benefit of  in fiscal the fiscal provision represents federal and state alternative minimum tax requirements as well as foreign tax expense primarily related to our german and france operations 
the fiscal benefit is net of various state and foreign minimum tax expenses and arose primarily from the reversal of liabilities which adept believes are no longer probable  and as such have been adjusted 
adept adjusts its tax liabilities and assets based on consideration of a variety of factors  including interpretations of statutes and regulations as well as estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes 
adept has previously had net operating losses available to offset most of its domestic and foreign tax obligations except when yearly net operating loss limitations exist for domestic and foreign jurisdictions that result in some tax expense 
backlog 
our product backlog related to continuing operations at june  was approximately million  compared with million at june  backlog is calculated based on orders that are expected to ship during the twelve months following each fiscal year end 
customers who have placed orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal period are not included in backlog  and thus we expect a substantial amount of the backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual net revenues for any period in the future 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of fixed assets of million and million net of depreciation at june  and  respectively 
financial information regarding the geographic breakdown of our long lived assets is included in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents litigation adept is currently involved in litigation with its landlord of its livermore  california facilities  referred to as landlord see item legal proceedings 
the landlord has delivered lease termination notices to adept  most recently indicating that the livermore lease would terminate on august   and demanding payment of a million termination fee no later than june  based on the landlord s interpretation of a lease termination agreement dated december  between adept and the landlord 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the landlord filed an unlawful detainer action seeking to recover immediate possession of the livermore facilities  claiming the failure to pay the termination payment constituted a breach of the lease agreement for such facilities in addition to a breach of the lease termination agreement and seeking payment of million as a termination fee  the forfeiture of the lease  and attorneys fees and costs 
this action is currently scheduled to go to trial on september  on july   the landlord initiated additional litigation seeking a declaration that the terms of the lease termination agreement required adept to pay million to the landlord and to vacate the premises no later than august   and pay damages  punitive damages  attorneys fees  and costs 
among other things  the landlord alleges that the landlord was required to deliver possession of the livermore facilities to its new tenant  no later than september   and is seeking damages and punitive damages  including but not limited to the value of the year lease with the new tenant 
adept disputes the landlord s interpretation of the lease termination agreement  including its alleged obligations and the effect of adept s choosing not to pay million in combination with relinquishing the leased property  and is vigorously defending these litigation matters with its landlord 
the outcome of these litigation matters cannot be determined at this time and significant legal costs are expected to be incurred in the future to defend these actions even if no damages are ultimately paid by adept 
from time to time  the company is party to various legal proceedings or claims  either asserted or unasserted  which arise in the ordinary course of its business 
the company has reviewed pending legal matters and believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
adept has in the past received communications from third parties asserting that it has infringed certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others  or seeking indemnification against alleged infringement 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the likelihood or outcome of any actual or potential actions from such assertions against the company  we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources we had an aggregate cash and short term investments balance of million and million for fiscal years end june  and  respectively 
we also had a credit facility of up to million  with no outstanding balance at year end or borrowings during both fiscal years 
we depend on funds generated from operations and collections of accounts receivable to meet our operating requirements
