item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  entertainment  military  medical and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two segments the manufacture and distribution of displays and display components display segment and the wholesale distribution of consumer electronic parts from foreign and domestic manufacturers wholesale distribution segment 
the display segment is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
monitor offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical and industrial applications 
data display crts offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crts offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to improve the profitability of operations while seeking acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
in addition  the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averages over days  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors due to the fact that it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by fairly rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 

table of contents interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million as of february  which is subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
variable interest rates on the company s loans and the potential for rate hikes could negatively impact the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 
operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages which selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions

data display crts sales in fiscal benefited from the addition of the clinton division which offset declines in the data and uk divisions 
entertainment crt net sales declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with recent prior fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
future sales trends in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for larger  more expensive sets 
because the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce exposure to obsolescence 
components parts sales increased million from fiscal to fiscal component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
component parts sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
wholesale distribution segment net sales growth is attributed to an expansion of the call center in fiscal  which acts as a consumer and dealer support center for in warranty and out of warranty household products  appliances  parts and accessories for black decker  delonghi  norelco  coby and various other manufacturers 
this call center also acts as a technical support center for these same manufacturers 
gross margins consolidated gross margins decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal display segment margins increased from for fiscal to for fiscal gross margins within the monitor operation decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to delays and increased costs on several contracts in fiscal at the aydin division

in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  borrowings from its ceo and long term debt 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors

the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the timing of sales near the end of the fiscal year 
the overall aging of accounts receivable improved slightly at february  compared to the prior fiscal year end 
the reduction in inventory is primarily due to a reduction in bulk purchases of last time buys of crts as the company anticipates a trend of reduced demand for these products in the replacement market

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and interchangeability of crt types along with repair contracts currently maintained by its customers  as well as numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 

table of contents during fiscal and fiscal  the company deducted inventory against the reserve for obsolescence in the amount of million and million respectively 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collectibility can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture crts to a buyer s specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the wholesale distribution segment has several distribution agreements that it accounts for using the gross revenue basis as prescribed by eitf issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company uses the gross method because the company has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk and credit risk 
the call center service revenue is recognized based on written pricing agreements with each manufacturer  on a per call  per email or per standard mail basis 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  
table of contents requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation

this statement replaces sfas  business combinations 
this statement retains the fundamental requirements in statement that the acquisition method of accounting which statement called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement also establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in it s financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and c determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination

table of contents impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments 
the company has a subsidiary in the uk  which is not material  but uses the british pound as its functional currency 
due to its limited operations outside of the us  the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies or to weakening economic conditions in foreign markets is not expected to significantly affect the company s financial position
