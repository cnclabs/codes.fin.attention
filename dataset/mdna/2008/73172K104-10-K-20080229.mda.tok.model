overview we are a leading global provider of high quality  easy to use communications solutions that enable enterprise and public sector customers to more effectively collaborate over distance  time zones and organizational boundaries 
our solutions are built on architectures that enable unified voice  video and content communications 
our offerings are organized in three segments video solutions  voice communications and services 
the shift from circuit switched telephony networks to internet protocol ip based networks continues to be a significant driver for polycom s collaborative communications markets and for our business 
high definition hd voice  video and content is another key driver for polycom 
this significant improvement in quality is enabling telepresence and other communications models that approximate in person communications 
strategically  polycom is investing most of its research  development  sales and marketing efforts into delivering a superior ip based  hd collaborative communications solution  using polycom proprietary technology in the evolving  standards based ip communications environment 
our goal is to deliver best of breed hd collaborative communications solutions that integrate into any enterprise call management system or instant message environment 
on january   we completed our acquisition of destiny conferencing corporation  or destiny 
destiny designed and manufactured immersive telepresence solutions 
polycom incorporated destiny s products 
table of contents into its rpx telepresence offering prior to the acquisition under the terms of an oem distribution agreement between the companies 
in addition  these products became the foundation for our recently announced tpx telepresence offering 
as a result of the acquisition  we now own several patents core to telepresence  a rapidly emerging market driven by the need for dispersed people to communicate as if they are all in the same room 
destiny s results of operations are included in our results of operations as part of our video solutions and services segments from january   the date of acquisition 
on march   we completed our acquisition of spectralink corporation 
spectralink designs  manufactures and sells on premises wireless telephone products to customers worldwide that complement existing telephone systems by providing mobile communications in a building or campus environment 
spectralink wireless telephone products increase the efficiency of employees by enabling them to remain in telephone contact while moving throughout the workplace 
we believe that the spectralink acquisition will position us as the only independent provider of both fixed and mobile solutions that seamlessly encompass voice  video and data collaboration solutions from the desktop  to the meeting room  to the mobile individual 
spectralink s results of operations are included in our results of operations as part of our voice communications and services segments from march   the date of acquisition 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our acquisitions and related costs and charges 
revenues were million in as compared to million in revenues from wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for approximately million of the year over year increase 
the remaining increase in revenues primarily reflects increased sales volumes of our video and voice communications products and  to a lesser extent  increases in service revenues 
network systems product revenues were essentially flat in compared to gross margins and operating margins decreased in over primarily as a result of acquisition related charges related to the spectralink and destiny acquisitions  such as amortization of purchased intangibles  increased stock based compensation and decreased margins on our voice communications products due to a shift in product mix towards lower margin voip and wireless products 
these effects were partially offset by increased margins on our services revenues 
during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities  which after the impact of other investing and financing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net decrease in our total cash and cash equivalents 
our video solutions  voice communications and services segments accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenues in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments  including a summary of our segment revenues  segment contribution margin  segment inventory and revenue by geography

network systems product revenues were essentially flat 

table of contents video solutions segment revenues include revenues from sales of our video communications and network systems product lines 
revenue from video communications products increased to million for from million in  a increase  primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and average selling prices of our group video products  which consisted primarily of our vsx and hdx product families 
revenues from our network systems products for were million  essentially flat compared to revenues of million  due primarily to increases in revenues from our video network systems and software product sales being substantially offset by decreases in our voice network system revenues 
network system product revenues were impacted by a decrease in video network system average selling prices  due in part to increased competition 
voice communications product revenues increased primarily as a result of revenues from our wireless voice products acquired in the spectralink acquisition  as well as increases in sales volumes of our voice over ip and circuit switched products 
services revenues increased primarily due to increases in voice related services as a result of the acquired spectralink product lines  as well as increased video related services and video network system services 
total revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase was due to increased sales volumes of our voice and video communications products  and to a lesser extent  increases in service revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in network systems revenues

table of contents in  no one customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues or of our video solutions  voice communications or services segment revenues 
in  one channel partner accounted for of our total net revenues and of our video solutions segment revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our voice communications or services segment revenues in in  no one customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues or our video solutions or services segment revenues  however  one channel partner accounted for of our voice communications segment revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
we also sell our voice network systems directly to end users and the revenues in the video solutions segment from end users are subject to more variability than our revenues from our reseller customers 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and  therefore  backlog has not been a good indicator of future revenues 
as of december   we had million of order backlog as compared to million at december  we include in backlog open product orders which we expect to ship or services which we expect to bill and record revenue for in the following quarter 
once billed  unrecorded service revenue is included in deferred revenue 
we believe that the current level of backlog will continue to fluctuate primarily as a result of the level and timing of orders received and customer delivery dates requested outside of the quarter 
the level of backlog at any given time is also dependent in part on our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly and ongoing service deferrals as service revenues increase as a percent of total revenue 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based in part on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders  which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline from current levels 
cost of revenues and gross margins year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands product cost of revenues of product revenues pts pt product gross margins pts pt service cost of revenues of service revenues pts pts service gross margins pts pts total cost of revenues of total revenues pts total gross margin pts cost of product revenues and product gross margins cost of product revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments  amortization and impairment of certain intangible assets  stock based compensation costs and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
cost of product revenues and product gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the comparable period does not include any charges for stock based compensation 
generally  video solutions segment products have a higher gross margin than products in our voice communications segment 

table of contents overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage points in as compared to which is due in part to the amortization of core and existing technology purchased intangibles as a result of our recent acquisitions and increased stock based compensation costs 
in addition  cost of product revenues increased as a result of the write up of inventory to its fair value at the time of the acquisitions 
these increased costs  which are not allocated to our segments  accounted for approximately percentage points of the decrease in gross margin in excluding these unallocated costs  gross margins decreased in both our video solutions and voice communications segments in versus the comparable period 
the fluctuation in these segments gross margin was primarily due to changes in product mix 
our voice over ip handset products and the wireless products we acquired from spectralink have a lower gross margin than the consolidated gross margin of our other voice communications products which resulted in lower gross margins during  and depending upon the product mix could result in lower voice communications gross margins in the future 
our gross margins on our wireless products were also negatively impacted by changes in our distribution model whereby we transitioned certain direct customers and resellers to purchase from our distributors and this may continue 
the decrease in gross margins in our video solutions segment was primarily due to decreased margins on our video network systems as a result of decreased average selling prices  substantially offset by higher gross margins on our group video systems 
overall  product gross margins decreased by percentage point in as compared to as a result of decreased margins in voice communications segment  partially offset by increased margins in video solutions 
the decrease in voice communications was due to a shift in product mix toward lower margin voice over ip desktop products  as well as increased expenses related to stock based compensation and additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
the increase in video solutions gross margins was due to increased average selling prices due to product mix and the fact that the first year of service is no longer bundled in the product price  which was partially offset by increased expenses related to stock based compensation and additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
effective july   we began to separately charge for the initial year of service for our video conferencing products rather than charging one combined price for the product and service 
as a result  we are no longer required to defer a portion of the product revenues to cover the first year of service 
this increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in both video network systems and network systems software as a result of decreased average selling prices and higher expenses related to stock based compensation 
this was partially offset by increased margins in voice network systems due to the higher software content of these products  which results in higher gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  services have a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the comparable period does not include any charges for stock based compensation 
overall  service gross margins increased in over as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs  as well as a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin video maintenance revenues 
this was offset partially by increased expenses related to stock based compensation 
overall  service gross margins increased in over as a result of revenues increasing at a faster pace than related service costs  as well as a shift in mix of services revenues toward higher margin video maintenance revenues 
service gross margins were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx products that was included in the product price through june  and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
these factors were offset partially by increased expenses related to stock based compensation 

table of contents general comments forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain our current gross margin levels 
uncertainties surrounding revenue levels and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  and the potential of resulting royalties to third parties  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty and recall costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of revenues percentage to vary significantly 
in addition  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products  such as the cost increases for memory devices used in many of our products and cost increases in components that are required to be in compliance with the restrictions on hazardous substances rohs rules in europe 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays or the lack of market acceptance of our new products could occur  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 
further  new products typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction and we ve recently launched a number of new products and new products are becoming an increasing percentage of our revenues 
for example  our hd video products  which generate higher gross profit dollars than our other non hd video products due to higher average selling prices  may result in a lower overall gross margin percentage for an extended period of time after their introduction depending upon the mix of products sold during the period 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase due to a change in our mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
cost of revenues will also increase in over the levels as a result of increased compensation charges due to additional headcount and annual merit increases and incentive accruals 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  stock based compensation costs  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing expenses  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
sales and marketing expenses  except for direct marketing expenses  are not allocated to our segments 
sales and marketing expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the comparable period does not include any charges for stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage point in as compared to the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in over was due primarily to an increase in sales commissions and co op marketing charges as a result of increased revenues  increases in our sales and marketing headcount due to our acquisition of spectralink and the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  as well as increased compensation charges due to incentive compensation costs and stock based compensation expense 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was flat in as compared to the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to an increase in sales commissions and co op marketing charges as a result of increased revenues  increases in our sales and marketing headcount due to the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts  as well as increased compensation charges due to annual merit increases  incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense 

table of contents we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to increase our sales coverage across all our markets  including emerging markets and key vertical markets  through the hiring of additional sales personnel and additional marketing programs in order to capitalize on the demand for high definition products  to sell and market the additional product offerings we anticipate as a result of our strategic partnerships and to increase revenues of our wlan products we acquired in the spectralink acquisition 
marketing expenses will also fluctuate depending upon the timing and extent of marketing programs as we market new products and also depending upon the timing of trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses may also fluctuate due to increased international expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses will increase in over the levels as a result of increased compensation charges due to annual merit increases and incentive accruals  and to a lesser extent  increases in stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pts pt research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
research and development expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the comparable period does not include any charges for stock based compensation 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased for as compared to  primarily due to spending increasing by in over as compared to revenues increasing in over the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was due to planned increases in program development expenses to support increased investment in new product initiatives  such as our high definition video and voice products and enhancements to our network systems products  as well as increased compensation charges related to increased headcount due to our acquisition of spectralink  incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased in as compared to in both our video solutions and voice communications segments 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased for as compared to  primarily due to spending increasing by in over as compared to revenues increasing in over the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was due to planned headcount increases and program development expenses to support increased investment in new product initiatives  such as our high definition video and voice products and next generation network systems products  as well as increased compensation charges related to annual merit increases  incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses increased in as compared to in both our video solutions and voice communications segments 
we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade the products that comprise our unified collaboration communications solutions  which encompass products and services in all three segments  including enhancements to our existing network systems products  products that address the high definition video conferencing market and additional voice over ip products 
we also plan to make incremental investments in research and development in wlan to broaden the enterprise wide application for the spectralink products 
in addition  we are investing research and development resources across all segments to support our strategic partnerships 
with the recent formation of our video solutions division  we anticipate committing a greater proportion of our research and development expenses toward enhancing the integration and interoperability of our entire video solutions product suite 

table of contents we believe that technological leadership is critical to our future success  and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in over but will decrease as a percentage of revenues 
in addition  research and development expenses will increase in over the levels as a result of increased compensation charges due to annual merit increases and incentive accruals  and to a lesser extent  increases in stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  litigation costs and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses are not allocated to our segments 
general and administrative expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the comparable period does not include any charges for stock based compensation 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses remained flat in  as compared to the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative in over was primarily due to increased compensation charges related to increased headcount from our spectralink acquisition  increased incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense  as well as increased legal and project related outside services costs 
in  the increase in compensation charges  including stock compensation costs  accounted for million of the increase  legal and outside services accounted for million of the increase and increases in infrastructure costs accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased by percentage point in  as compared to  due to the increase in stock based compensation versus the year ago period 
the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative in over was primarily due to increased compensation charges related to annual merit increases  increased incentive accruals and stock based compensation expense  as well as legal and project related outside services costs 
this was partially offset by decreased infrastructure costs 
in  the increase in compensation charges  including stock compensation costs  accounted for million of the increase  and legal and outside services accounted for million of the increase  which was partially offset by decreases in infrastructure costs of million 
the remaining changes are related to numerous smaller items 
significant future charges due to costs associated with litigation  or uncollectibility of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of litigation and bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
general and administrative expenses will increase in the first quarter of as a result of the fee arrangement we have with outside legal counsel that represented us in our litigation against codian  pursuant to which we owe additional legal fees based upon the favorable outcome that was achieved in the first quarter of we believe that our general and administrative expenses will also likely continue to 
table of contents increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff  investments in enhancements to our financial and operating systems and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and our continued investments in international regions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses will increase in over the levels as a result of increased compensation charges due to annual merit increases and incentive accruals  and to a lesser extent  increases in stock based compensation expense 
acquisition related integration costs we recorded charges to operations of million in  million in and million in for acquisition related integration costs 
these charges primarily include outside financial advisory  accounting  legal and consulting fees and other costs directly related to integrating acquired companies 
the charges primarily related to professional services costs to integrate spectralink  which we acquired in march  and to a lesser extent destiny  which we acquired in january the charges in and primarily related to professional services costs to integrate dstmedia  which we acquired in august we expect to continue to incur additional costs related to the integration of spectralink in if we acquire additional businesses in the future  we may incur material acquisition expenses related to these transactions 
purchased in process research and development in and  we recorded charges totaling million and million for in process research and development acquired as part of our acquisitions of spectralink and dstmedia  respectively 
there were no such charges in the research and development acquired as part of the spectralink acquisition related primarily to projects associated with enhancements and upgrades to the functionality and performance of the link  netlink and dect products 
the amount allocated to purchased in process research and development was determined by management after considering  among other factors  established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry and was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects as of the acquisition date 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and in process research and development for spectralink and dstmedia 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the in process research and development projects were discounted at rates ranging from to for spectralink and for dstmedia in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technology feasibility 
the key assumptions used in valuing the spectralink in process research and development primarily consisted of an expected completion date for the in process projects  which ranged in stages of completion from to and were expected to be completed over the next to months  estimated costs to complete the projects of approximately million  revenue and expense projections and discount rates based on the risks associated with the development lifecycle of the in process technology acquired 
at december   all significant in process research and development projects had been completed 
amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  for amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition to the amounts recorded as operating expenses in  we recorded amortization totaling million related to certain technology intangibles in cost of product revenues 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to eight years 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of the total operating expense related to the impairment of certain intangibles that we acquired in the voyant acquisition 

table of contents the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to the purchased intangibles from the spectralink and destiny acquisitions in early  partially offset by decreases related to certain purchased intangibles related to the voyant acquisition becoming fully amortized as of december  the decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to the purchased intangibles related to the meetu acquisition becoming fully amortized in  and the impairment of certain intangibles from the voyant acquisition at the end of which reduced the amortization 
these decreases were only partially offset by the addition of purchased intangibles related to the dstmedia acquisition in august of we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on the results of the  and impairment assessments  we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of the respective year end periods  and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in and  these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from future products that will utilize the technology acquired in the acquisition 
in  these assets were written down as a result of a decline in the projected future cash flows from the oci product line due to its announced discontinuance in the fourth quarter of at december   the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million 
restructure costs in  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  related to restructuring actions which resulted from the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management 
these actions are generally intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in  these actions primarily related to the reorganization of our video and network systems divisions into one combined business unit  the video solutions group  and the elimination of certain executive positions 
in  these actions included the relocation of our asia pacific headquarters from hong kong to singapore  as well as elimination of certain other sales and administrative functions 
these actions affected less than three percent of our global workforce 
in  these actions included reductions or relocation of certain positions throughout the company  primarily in sales and administrative functions  and affected less than one percent of our global workforce 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructure costs 
subsequent to december   severance packages for the executives impacted in the restructuring actions were renegotiated  and their employment terminated on january  the revised total charges expected to be incurred related to these actions is million  all of which will be paid prior to march  of these total charges  the remaining million will be expensed in the quarter ending march  in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 

table of contents interest income  net interest income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts 
interest income  net of interest expense  was million in  million in and million in interest income decreased in over primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of the net cash paid for our acquisitions of spectralink and destiny in the first quarter of  as well as due to our stock repurchase activity in this was partially offset by higher average investment returns 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income increased in over primarily due to higher average investment returns  partially offset by lower average cash and investment balances due to our stock repurchase activity in average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in  compared to in interest income  net will likely fluctuate in due to movement in our cash balances and changes in market interest rates 
the cash balance could decrease depending upon the cash used in future acquisitions  our stock repurchase activity and other factors 
gain loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons  we have made various investments in private companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost and written down to fair market value when indications exist that these investments have other than temporarily declined in value 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
we evaluate a number of factors  including price per share of any recent financing  expected timing of additional financing  liquidation preferences  historical and forecast earnings and cash flows  cash burn rate  and technological feasibility of the investee company s products to assess whether or not the investment is impaired 
at december  and  these investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in and  we made additional investments in two private companies totaling million and million  respectively 
in and  our investments were permanently written down by million and million  respectively  from original cost  which is reflected in gain loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the write down of million in the second quarter of was based upon our evaluation of the investee s financial position  including cash usage  the status of the investee s business prospects as of june   and the rights and privileges associated with the investment 
based on this evaluation and our intent as of june  not to participate in the round of additional funding of the investee that was in process at the time  it was determined that based upon the preferences  including liquidation preferences  that would be held by more senior securities  the write down of the carrying value to zero was necessary 
in  a privately held company in which we held an investment with a carrying value of million was sold  resulting in a gain of million in and a gain of million in when the final escrow was settled 
these amounts are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in gain loss on strategic investments 
provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes  including taxes related to discontinued operations  of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in versus was due to a relative increase in foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates  combined with the settlement of certain audits with foreign tax authorities  substantially offset by the non deductibility of the in process research and development acquired in the spectralink acquisition 
the decrease in the effective rate 
table of contents in versus was due primarily to the one time tax impact of million for the distribution we made in under the american jobs creation act  combined with the resolution of certain tax uncertainties in foreign tax jurisdictions that allowed us to release previously accrued taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million in tax net operating loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryovers  as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on income tax expense must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
as a result  we decreased our reserves for uncertain tax positions by million 
a million decrease in relation to interest and penalties and various tax reserves was accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
a million decrease related to pre acquisition tax reserves was accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill 
at the adoption date of january   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which would affect our income tax expense if recognized 
the remaining balance of the unrecognized tax benefits of million would be an adjustment to goodwill or stockholders equity 
in addition  we recognized certain net operating loss carryovers of picturetel that had not been recognized previously 
this resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 
segment information a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december   and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales  direct marketing and direct engineering expenses 
management allocates corporate manufacturing costs and some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include sales costs  marketing costs other than direct marketing  stock based compensation costs  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related integration costs  amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets  purchase accounting adjustments made to inventory  purchased in process research and development costs  restructuring costs  interest income  net  and other expense  net

in  one channel partner accounted for of our total net revenues of our video solutions segment 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any one channel partner would have a long term material adverse effect on consolidated revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our network systems products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
the contribution margin as a percentage of video solutions segment revenues was in as compared to in contribution margins increased primarily as a result of engineering expenses decreasing as a percent of revenues  although increasing in absolute dollars 
this was offset by slightly lower gross margins in as compared to in both our video and network systems product lines 
this was due in part to new products which typically have lower gross margins for a period of time after their introduction and we ve recently launched a number of new products and new products are becoming an increasing percentage of our revenues 
for example  our hd video products  which generate higher gross profit dollars than our other non hd video products due to higher average selling prices  may result in a lower overall gross margin percentage for an extended period of time after their introduction depending upon the mix of products sold during the period 
direct marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars and slightly as a percent of revenues

table of contents services year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of service revenue pts pts revenues from our services segment for increased over to million  due primarily to increased revenues from our spectralink acquisition in the first quarter of as well as increases in video solutions related services  including both video endpoints and video network systems 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in voice network systems maintenance services 
revenues from services related to products acquired in the spectralink acquisition accounted for million of the increase over the year ago period 
revenues from our services segment for increased over to million  due primarily to an increase in video maintenance services as a result of amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx product line and increased video network systems services 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in ipower related video services and  to a lesser extent  decreases in voice network systems maintenance services 
international revenues  defined as revenues outside of canada and the us  accounted for  and of total service revenues for  and  respectively

service gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of revenue increasing at a faster pace than related service costs 
service gross margins in were also favorably impacted by the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the first year of service on our vsx and v products that was included in the product price and amortized over the twelve month period following shipment 
this impact was due to increased volumes of these products in as compared to effective july   we began to separately charge for the initial year of service for our video conferencing products rather than charging one combined price for the product and service 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government securities  state and local government securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million that are in place to satisfy certain of our facility lease requirements 

table of contents we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  and larger increases in accounts payable and taxes payable 
offsetting these positive effects were a larger increase in accounts receivable  larger increase in inventories  smaller decrease in deferred taxes  smaller increase in other accrued liabilities and a larger increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased net income and non cash expenses  larger increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities and a smaller increase in inventories 
offsetting these positive effects were a larger increase in accounts receivable  smaller decrease in deferred taxes and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was a decrease of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  million for the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and million in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments  net of purchases 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for net cash paid in acquisitions  million for purchases of our common stock and million for purchases of property and equipment 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses and other items such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs for excess and obsolescence  non cash stock based compensation  excess tax benefit from stock based compensation  gain from sale of discontinued operations  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  gain on strategic investments  the purchase of in process research and development and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  reductions in deferred taxes and net increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting the positive effect of these items were net increases in trade receivables  inventories and prepaid expenses and other assets 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  compared to days at december  this increase in dso was due primarily to fluctuations in revenue linearity 
we expect that dso will remain in the to day range but could vary as a result of a number of factors such as fluctuations in revenue linearity  an increase in international receivables which typically have longer payment terms and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities that have longer payment terms of and days  respectively  compared to day terms for other customers 
inventory turns decreased slightly from turns at december  to turns at december  we believe inventory turns will fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix and a greater mix of ocean freight versus air freight to reduce freight costs 
additionally  payments we make for income taxes may increase during as our available net operating losses are depleted 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded as other income expense  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  we also have a hedging program that uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the forward exchange contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any ineffective portion of a hedging instrument would be recorded as other income expense

from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit totaling approximately million to secure the leases on some of our offices 
the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments due under our current lease obligations 
total estimated sublease income in is less than million and is netted in the amounts 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands net minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted the provisions of fin as of january  at december   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the related interest totaling million  none of which is expected to be due within the next months 

table of contents we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
additionally  we recognize extended service revenue on our hardware and software products ratably over the service period  generally one to five years 
our video solutions products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through our maintenance contracts 
accordingly  we account for revenue for these products in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the arrangement  we defer revenue based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we defer all revenue until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 

table of contents we accrue for sales returns and other allowances as a reduction to revenues upon shipment based upon our contractual obligations and historical experience 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
co op marketing funds are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation expense we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values in accordance with sfas r  which requires us to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these underlying factors and assumptions may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for employee equity awards and employee stock purchases using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  other than as related to acquisitions  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
in order to fully utilize these deferred tax assets we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
we believe based upon our financial projections that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets and therefore  as of december   we have not established a valuation allowance against these assets 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation requires us to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained 
upon adoption  we decreased our reserves for uncertain tax positions by million 
a million decrease in relation to interest and penalties and various tax reserves was accounted for as a cumulative adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
a million decrease related to pre acquisition tax reserves was accounted for as an adjustment to goodwill 
in addition  we recognized certain net operating loss carryovers of picturetel that had not been recognized previously 
this resulted in the establishment of a deferred tax asset of million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill 
we continue to follow the practice of recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a part of provision for income taxes 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the spectralink acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intend to sublease or for which we intend to negotiate a lease termination settlement 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair value would be required 
changes occurring in our estimates after the allocation period  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles at least annually unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
we assess the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
table of contents indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of december  we assess our purchased intangibles for impairment on an ongoing basis 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on events in the fourth quarters of  and  we performed an assessment of our purchased intangibles and we determined that certain purchased intangible assets acquired as part of the voyant acquisition had been impaired as of december   and and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
for example  to date  due to these and other factors  we have recorded cumulative charges against earnings totaling million associated with the impairment of these investments  including million in the second quarter of at december  and december   our strategic investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively 

table of contents derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  that the implementation of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas r changes the requirements for an acquirer s recognition and measurement of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination 
sfas no

in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires i that noncontrolling minority interests be reported as a component of shareholders equity  ii that net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations  iii that changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions  iv that any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value  and v that sufficient disclosures are provided that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas no 
is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
however  the presentation and disclosure requirements of the statement shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
is not anticipated to materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
the investment portfolio includes highly liquid  high quality instruments 
some investments in the portfolio may contain an embedded derivative  and interest rate hedges may be placed if they are tied to a specific investment or group of investments in accordance with our investment policy  however  they are generally not significant 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us  state and municipal government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities

while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we purchase forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound and israeli shekel 
we mitigate bank counterparty risk related to our foreign currency hedging program through our policy that requires the company to purchase hedge contracts from banks that are among the world s largest banks  as ranked by total assets in us dollars 
as of december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  sell million british pounds at  and buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically mature in days or less

these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
as a result of our acquisition of spectralink  we now have operations in horsens  denmark 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign denominated inventory purchases made by the denmark operation 
for the year ended december   the gains from these foreign currency exchange contracts were not significant 
changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in other income loss  net at the end of each period and were not material for the periods presented 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
