overview we are a medical technology company focused on the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our broad product portfolio and pipeline includes a variety of spinal disorder products and systems focused on solutions addressing the cervical  thoracolumbar  intervertebral  minimally invasive  motion preservation  vertebral compression fracture  and osteoporotic bone markets 
our principal product offerings are focused on the global market for orthopedic spinal disorder implants  which is estimated to be more than billion in revenue in and is expected to grow at approximately annually over the next three years 
our surgeons culture emphasizes collaboration with spinal surgeons to conceptualize  design and co develop a broad range of products 
we have a state of the art in house manufacturing facility that provides us with a unique competitive advantage  and enables us to rapidly deliver solutions to meet surgeons and patients critical needs 
our products and systems are made of titanium  titanium alloy  stainless steel and a strong  heat resistant  radiolucent  biocompatible plastic called polyetheretherketone  or peek 
we also sell products made of allograft  a precision milled and processed human bone that surgeons can use in place of metal and synthetic materials 
we also sell bone grafting products that are comprised of both tissue based and synthetic materials 
we believe that our products and systems have enhanced features and benefits that make them attractive to surgeons and that our broad portfolio of products and systems provide a comprehensive solution for the safe and successful surgical treatment of spine disorders 
all of our currently marketed implants have been cleared by the us food and drug administration  or the fda  and these products have been used in over  and  spine disorder surgeries in and  respectively 
in addition to our us operations  we also market a range of spine and orthopedic products in japan through our subsidiary  alphatec pacific  inc  or alphatec pacific  and in we plan to begin selling our products in europe 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of alphatec spine  inc  or alphatec spine  formerly alphatec manufacturing  inc  a company that was engaged in the development  manufacturing and sale of medical devices for use in spinal surgeries 
although our products generally are purchased by hospitals and surgical centers  orders are typically placed at the request of surgeons who then use our products in a surgical procedure 
during the twelve months ended december  and december   no single surgeon  hospital or surgical center represented greater than of our consolidated revenues 
additionally  we sell a broad array of products  which diminishes our reliance on any single product 
in may  alphatec pacific acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of blues medica japan  or the jom predecessor  a medical device distributor 
in the third quarter of  jom predecessor changed its name to japan ortho medical 
in  as part of our product development strategy  we began entering into license agreements with third parties that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and commercialize unique products for the treatment of spinal disorders 
through december   we licensed approximately patent and patent applications from third parties 
a discussion of our license agreements may be found in item business intellectual property included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
to assist us in evaluating our product development strategy  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the spinal implant industry 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with 
table of contents the surgeon community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the spinal implant industry and the capacity requirements of our manufacturing facility 
our management also considers several variables associated with the ongoing operations of our business  including surgeon and market demand  product life cycle  scheduled manufacturing  purchasing activity  inventory levels  head count  and expenses related to research and development 
we are currently focused on increasing the size and effectiveness of our sales force  marketing activities  research and development efforts  inventory management  management team and corporate infrastructure

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have included the issuance of equity and bank borrowings 
principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations  acquisitions  acquisition of intellectual property rights  capital expenditures and working capital 
we expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  and potential acquisitions 
we expect that  as our revenues grow  our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve profitability

debt and credit facilities and repurchase obligations in october  we entered into a three year credit agreement with merrill lynch  or the merrill lynch credit agreement  to support our working capital needs 
the merrill lynch credit agreement consists of a revolving note in the amount of million  or the loan 
the loan bears interest at the rate of libor plus per annum 
the amount available to be drawn under the loan is limited to of the net collectible value of eligible accounts receivable of alphatec spine plus of the eligible inventory of the alphatec spine 
the loan is secured by a pledge of substantially all currently existing and after acquired property of alphatec spine and us  including all proceeds and products therefrom 
the merrill lynch credit agreement excludes from the collateral i any intellectual property rights  including copyrights  patents  trademarks and inbound licenses relating to any of the copyrights  patents or trademarks  and ii any claims for damages relating to infringement of the intellectual property 
while these items are excluded from collateral  the merrill lynch credit agreement contains a covenant in which both alphatec spine and we have agreed not to place any lien on such assets without merrill lynch s consent 
on december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this loan 
we have entered into various capital lease arrangements through december  the leases bear interest at rates ranging from to  are generally due in monthly principal and interest installments  are collateralized by the related equipment  and have maturity dates ranging from october to march we did not enter into any capital leases in the fiscal year ended during the second quarter of  alphatec spine entered into term loans with general electric capital corporation  or gecc  for approximately million in order to finance certain previously purchased machinery and office equipment

under the terms of these loans  alphatec spine is required to make equal monthly principal and interest payments of million and is subject to certain covenants that are defined in the credit agreement by and between alphatec spine and merrill lynch 
if alphatec spine fails to satisfy these covenants and fails to cure any breach of these covenants within a specified number of days after receipt of notice  or fails to pay interest or principal under the loan when due  gecc could accelerate the entire amount borrowed  which would also trigger a default under alphatec spine s credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of  alphatec spine entered into an additional term loan with gecc for approximately million in order to finance certain previously purchased machinery and office equipment

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  bad debts and intangibles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 

table of contents determination of criteria iii and iv are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
specifically  our revenue from sales of medical devices is recognized upon receipt of written acknowledgement that the product has been used in a surgical procedure or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title and the related risks and rewards that go with it 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
production costs are applied to inventory based on our estimated average cost 
we maintain valuation reserves for the differences between our actual and estimated costs 
we are continually striving to improve our production processes and reduce costs 
we will monitor the adequacy of the valuation reserves  however  depending on our success in controlling and reducing costs  a significant change in our reserves may be required 
we review the components of inventory on a quarterly basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory  and record a reserve for the identified items 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our allograft implants have up to a four year shelf life and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative implant products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are subject to uncertainty 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding expense to cost of revenues 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to periodically assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets can not be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the assets 
due to the numerous variables 
table of contents associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in october  alphatec spine and we entered into a credit agreement with merrill lynch to support our working capital needs 
the merrill lynch credit agreement consists of a revolving note in the amount of million 
the note bears interest at the rate of libor plus per annum 
the amount available to be drawn under the note is limited to of the net collectible value of eligible accounts receivable of alphatec spine plus of the eligible inventory of the alphatec spine 
as of december   alphatec spine has no borrowings under this credit facility 
alphatec spine s borrowings under its credit facility  which bear interest at 
table of contents libor plus  expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
if applicable interest rates were to increase by basis points  then for every million outstanding on our line of credit  our income before taxes would be reduced by approximately  per year 
we are not party to any material derivative financial instruments 
other outstanding debt consisted of fixed rate instruments  primarily in the form of capital leases and notes payable 
foreign currency exchange risk while a majority of our business is denominated in us dollars  we maintain operations in foreign countries  primarily japan  that require payments in the local currency 
for the twelve months ended december   our revenues denominated in foreign currencies were million 
substantially all of such revenues were denominated in japanese yen 
payments received from customers for goods sold in these countries are typically in the local currency 
consequently  fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period to period comparisons of our operating results 
for example  if the value of the us dollar were to increase relative to the japanese yen  the principal foreign currency in which most of our revenues outside the us are currently denominated  then our reported revenues would decrease when we convert the lower valued foreign currency into us dollars 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
the operational expenses of our foreign subsidiaries reduce the currency exposure we have because our foreign currency revenues are offset in part by expenses payable in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time 
commodity price risk we purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium and stainless steel 
these purchases expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact our product costs 
however  because our raw material prices comprise a small portion of our cost of revenues  we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity prices 
a change in commodity prices would have an immaterial impact on our results of operations for the twelve months ended december
