executive summary cephalon  inc is an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and marketing of innovative products to treat human diseases 
we currently focus our efforts in four core therapeutic areas central nervous system cns disorders  pain  oncology and addiction 
in addition to conducting an active research and development program  we market seven proprietary products in the united states and numerous products in various countries throughout europe 
consistent with our core therapeutic areas  we have aligned our approximately person us field sales and sales management teams by area 
in europe  we have a sales and marketing organization numbering approximately persons that supports our presence in nearly european countries  including france  the united kingdom  germany  italy and spain 
our most significant product is provigil  which comprised of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   of which was in the us market 
for the year ended december   consolidated net sales of provigil increased over the year ended december  provigil is indicated for the treatment of excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy  obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome osa hs and shift work sleep disorder swsd 
we co promote provigil in the united states with our partner  takeda pharmaceuticals north america  inc together with our cns field sales team  we now have approximately persons focused on detailing provigil in the united states 
in june  we secured final fda approval of nuvigil for the same indications as provigil 
nuvigil is a single isomer formulation of modafinil  the active ingredient in provigil 
the product is protected by a composition of matter patent that will expire on december  and covers a novel polymorphic form of armodafinil  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in nuvigil 
we currently intend to launch nuvigil around our two next most significant products are fentora fentanyl buccal tablet 
c ii 
and actiq oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate 
c ii 
including our generic version of actiq generic otfc 
together  these products comprise of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   of which was in the us market 
in october  we launched in the united states fentora  our next generation proprietary pain product 
fentora is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
we have focused our clinical strategy for fentora on studying the product in opioid tolerant patients with breakthrough pain associated with chronic pain conditions  such as neuropathic pain and back pain 
in november  we submitted a supplemental new drug application snda to the fda seeking approval to market fentora for the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients with chronic pain conditions 
the fda has set september  as the action date for its review of this snda and has indicated that it will hold an advisory committee meeting in may to discuss this snda 
with respect to actiq  its sales have been meaningfully eroded by generic otfc products sold since september by barr and by us through our sales agent  watson  and we expect this erosion will continue into in august  we acquired the north american rights to amrix for million from e 
claiborne robins company  inc  a privately held company d b a ecr pharmaceuticals ecr 
under the acquisition agreement  ecr also could receive up to an additional million in milestone payments that are contingent on attainment of certain agreed upon sales levels of amrix 
two dosage strengths of amrix mg and mg were approved in february by the fda for short term use as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute  painful musculoskeletal conditions 
we made the product available in the united states in october and commenced a full us launch in november in february  we entered into an agreement with a contract sales provider to add sales representatives to our field sales team detailing amrix 
in september and december  we submitted new drug applications nda to the fda requesting approval of treanda bendamustine hydrochloride for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and patients with indolent b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl who have progressed during or following treatment with rituximab or a rituximab containing regimen  respectively 
the fda has accepted both ndas and has granted priority review and an orphan drug designation to treanda for the cll indication 
as a biopharmaceutical company  our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products and technology 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of our patents 
the loss of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity on any of our existing products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation  circumvention  license or expiration  could materially impact our results of operations 
in late and early  we entered into settlement agreements with each of teva  mylan  ranbaxy and barr 
as part of these separate settlements  we agreed to grant to each of these parties a non exclusive royalty bearing license to market and sell a generic version of provigil in the united states  effective in april in february  the us federal trade commission ftc filed suit against us in us district court for the district of columbia challenging the validity of the settlement and related agreements 
for more information concerning these settlements  see central nervous system disorders modafinil products intellectual property position below 
our activities and operations are subject to significant government regulations and oversight 
in early november  we announced that we had reached an agreement in principle with the us attorney s office usao in philadelphia and the us department of justice the doj with respect to the usao investigation that began in september the investigation was focused on our sales and promotional practices with respect to actiq  gabitril tiagabine hydrochloride and provigil 
under this agreement  we expect to pay million as part of a comprehensive settlement of all federal and related state medicaid claims 
in addition  we will agree to a single federal misdemeanor violation of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services 
the terms described above are subject to negotiation and the execution of the final settlement and corporate integrity agreements 
there can be no assurance that the settlement will be finalized on the terms outlined above 
in addition  in september  we announced that we had received a voluntary request for information from the office of the connecticut attorney general that also appears to be focused on our sales and promotional practices with respect to actiq  gabitril and provigil 
we are cooperating with this office  are providing documents and other information in response to these and additional requests and are engaged in ongoing discussions with them 
in late october  we also received a civil demand for information from the office of the massachusetts attorney general that is focused on sales and promotional practices with respect to actiq  fentora and certain of our other products 
we intend to cooperate with this request as well 
both of these matters may involve civil penalties and or fines 
the payment of any settlement or judgment amount and or fines could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
furthermore  it is reasonably likely that we will face future additional requests for information from other state attorneys general focused on historical sales and promotional practices for our us products 
if civil penalties and or fines were to result from such investigations  it could materially and adversely effect our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
we have significant levels of indebtedness outstanding  nearly all of which consists of convertible notes 
under the terms of the indentures governing nearly all of our notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
for a more complete description of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash  and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
as of december   the fair value of both the convertible senior subordinated notes due june  the notes and zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  and june  collectively  the zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes 
as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion under the current terms 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
while we seek to increase profitability and cash flow from operations  we will need to continue to achieve growth of product sales and other revenues sufficient for us to attain these objectives 
the rate of our future growth will depend  in part  upon our ability to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection for our currently marketed products  and to successfully develop or acquire and commercialize new product candidates

as of december   we have incurred million related to the construction of these two manufacturing lines 
we expect to incur up to an additional million to complete these two manufacturing lines 
salmedix  inc acquisition on june   we completed our acquisition of salmedix  inc as a result of the acquisition  we obtained us and canadian rights to treanda 
the results of operations for salmedix have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date

decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health incorporated 
we have distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
at december   we believe that inventory held at wholesalers and retailers of our generic otfc product  launched in october  is approximately three months supply 
for the year ended december   sales were impacted by changes in the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales as described further below and by changes in the relative levels of the number of units of inventory held at wholesalers and retailers 
for the year ended december   total sales remained consistent over the prior year 
the other key factors that contributed to the changes in sales are summarized by product as follows in cns  sales of provigil increased percent 
demand for provigil increased as evidenced by an increase in us prescriptions for provigil of  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   sales of provigil also were impacted by domestic price increases of from period to period 
european sales increased due to the favorable effect of exchange rate changes  stronger sales in substantially all territories and higher prices for gabitril 
in pain  sales decreased percent 
sales of actiq were impacted by an increase in domestic prices of from period to period  offset by an decrease in us prescriptions  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue related to sales of our own generic otfc and shipments of our generic otfc to barr  as compared to million in following our launch of generic otfc in late september we recognized million of revenue related to sales of fentora for the year ended december   as compared to million in following the launch of the product in october we also recognized million of revenue related to sales of amrix 
european sales of actiq were favorably impacted by the efforts of our co promotion partner in france that started during and the favorable effect of exchange rate changes 
in  we expect overall sales of our pain products to remain relatively consistent as compared to based on a continued shift in market share from actiq to generic otfc and the potential for further generic entrants into the market  partially offset by the increase in sales of fentora and amrix 
other sales  which consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products  increased percent 
the increase is attributable to an increase of million in sales of our european products  primarily driven by sales in france and sales of oncology products in europe and the favorable effect of exchange rate changes 
in addition  other sales in the us increased million  primarily driven by increases in sales of vivitrol and trisenox 
other revenues the increase of from period to period is primarily due to an increase in revenues from our collaborators including royalties  milestone payments and fees 
analysis of gross sales to net sales the following table presents the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales to arrive at a net sales figure year ended december  change change gross sales    product sales allowances prompt payment discounts   wholesaler discounts    returns    coupons    medicaid discounts    managed care and governmental contracts   net sales    product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales prompt payment discounts  generally granted at of sales  decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to a decrease in us sales that are eligible for the discount 
wholesaler discounts increased million period over period because cumulative price increases as of december  produced wholesaler credits that significantly offset the wholesaler discounts that would have been recorded for returns decreased as a result of our historical returns experience  particularly related to our cns products  that is used in the calculation of our returns reserve requirements and due to an overall decrease in us sales 
coupons decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of the elimination and expiration of actiq coupons on september   offset by the distribution of coupons for fentora  which was launched in october medicaid discounts decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the lower sales and medicaid utilization of our pain products  particularly branded actiq  offset by an increase in the reimbursement rate for actiq and generic otfc as a result of the application of the provisions of the deficit reduction act of effective october  managed care and governmental contracts increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to additional rebates for certain managed care and governmental programs  particularly with respect to sales of provigil and our generic otfc product 
in addition  we recognized a reduction in the managed care and governmental contracts allowance of million in the third quarter of  representing amounts paid to the us department of defense dod under the tricare program from october through june  in october  the dod announced that it would reimburse all companies that had voluntarily made such payments under the tricare program due to the us court of appeals september ruling 
in the future  we expect product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales to trend upward due to the impact of potential future price increases on medicaid discounts and potential increases related to medicaid  managed care and governmental contracts sales 
year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales    research and development    selling  general and administrative    settlement reserve   impairment charge   acquired in process research and development   cost of sales the cost of sales was of net sales for the year ended december  and of net sales for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million of amortization expense included in cost of sales  respectively 
the remainder of this fluctuation is primarily due to the following factors lower royalty expenses for actiq resulting from the decline in the royalty rate upon the expiration of the actiq patents in september  the favorable mix of product margins for certain of our product sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   offset by a decrease in product margin for our pain products resulting from the shift in market share from actiq to generic otfc  the net effect of price increases in on us products  an million inventory reserve related to sparlon modafinil tablets

research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in up front payments related to rights acquired to certain development stage products 
we also recognized a million milestone payment related to our nda filing for treanda in the third quarter of this decrease is also attributable to lower expenses associated with reduced levels of clinical activity in as compared to for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million of depreciation expense included in research and development expenses  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the cessation of the reimbursement of expenses from alkermes related to the promotion of vivitrol of million  increased sales and marketing spending on oncology products  expenses incurred under our agreements with takeda and watson and million for severance costs primarily related to the reorganization of our sales force 
these increases were offset by reduced spending on marketing expenses and continuing medical education grants for our existing products and million of one time payments made for the year ended december  in connection with provigil settlement agreements 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million of depreciation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively

during the fourth quarter of  we shipped launch quantities of our generic otfc 
at december   we believe that generic otfc inventory held at wholesalers and retailers is approximately two to three months 
sales of our generic otfc product to wholesalers and retailers include both the right of return of expired product and retroactive price reductions under certain conditions  while sales of fentora also include the right of return of expired product 
based on the sales levels and the prescription data during the fourth quarter of  and based on the number of units on hand in the pipeline at december  relative to the overall demand for the products  we have estimated and recorded all applicable product sales allowances related to generic otfc and fentora as of december  we have therefore recognized revenues for generic otfc and fentora based on a fixed and determinable sales price in for the year ended december   sales were impacted by changes in the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales as described further below and by changes in the relative levels of the number of units of inventory held at wholesalers and retailers

other sales  which consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products  increased percent 
this increase is attributable to sales of products acquired in the trisenox and zeneus acquisitions in july and december  respectively 
other revenues the decrease of from period to period is primarily due to a decrease in partner reimbursements on our cep program  which was halted in  and a decrease in revenues from clinical studies performed for collaborators

wholesaler discounts decreased due to the fact that fewer incremental wholesaler discounts were required for the year ended december  as a result of price increases 
decreases in product sales allowances were also caused by lower medicaid discounts resulting from a significant number of participants transferring to part d of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of program effective january  managed care and governmental contracts increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to additional rebates for certain managed care and governmental programs  offset by a reduction of million recognized in the third quarter of  representing amounts paid to the dod under the tricare program from october through june  in october  the dod announced that it would reimburse all companies that had voluntarily made such payments under the tricare program due to the us court of appeals september ruling

research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to million of payments for four research and development collaborations and the recognition of million of stock based compensation expense representing one half of the total stock based compensation expense recorded during the year ended december  based on the employees compensation allocation as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no

the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used for investing activities   net cash provided by used for financing activities  effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by income from sales of our products offset by the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 
the net loss for the year ended december  was offset by changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the agreement in principle with the us attorney s office for which million has been accrued but not yet paid 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by growth in income from sales of our products offset by the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 
while income from sales of provigil and actiq accounted for a significant portion of the growth in sales in  sales of generic otfc  fentora  trisenox and the portfolio of products obtained from the acquisition of zeneus  all of which were new sources of sales income in  also contributed to our growth in operating income over the prior year 
for the year ended december   growth in sales of provigil and actiq provided the most significant source of income from operations 
in conjunction with our acquisition of certain businesses in  we recorded acquired in process research and development expense of million 
these amounts are shown in the statements of cash flows for those years as adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash provided by operating activities since they are reflected in investing activities as acquisition of businesses 
conversely  aggregate cash payments of million made in were recorded directly to acquired in process research and development expense and are reflected within the net loss from operations 
net cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities primarily relates to acquisitions of business  technologies  products and product rights and funds invested in our administrative and manufacturing facilities to accommodate our growth 
these uses of cash are offset by sales  maturities or purchases of investments associated with our portfolio of available for sale investments 
net cash used for investing activities was million in as compared to million in the million decrease in cash flow in is primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash flow mainly stemming from the sale of marketable securities in  a million increase in cash flow from lower capital expenditures in as compared to  a million increase in cash flow for proceeds from the sale of an investment in  and a million increase in cash flow from lower expenditures on intangible assets in as compared to net cash used for investing activities was million in as compared to million in the million increase in cash flow in is primarily attributable to a million increase in cash flow mainly stemming from the purchase of salmedix  zeneus and trisenox in  a million increase in cash flow mainly from the net sale of marketable securities in as compared to the net purchase of marketable securities in  a million decrease in cash flow from higher expenditures on intangible assets in as compared to  and a million decrease in cash flow from higher capital expenditures in as compared to net cash provided by used for financing activities cash provided by used for financing activities primarily relates to proceeds and payments on long term debt and employee stock option activity 
for the years ended december   and  proceeds from stock option exercises were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the corresponding incremental windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation was million 
the cumulative pool of windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation was million as of december  in  we paid million in connection with our exchange of million of our outstanding convertible notes for cash and common stock and retired the remaining obligation of million of our notes due december in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of notes 
concurrent with the sale of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge for million and also sold warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds from the combined issuance of the notes  sale of warrants and purchase of convertible note hedge was partially offset by our tender offer whereby we purchased a significant portion of our notes for million in cash 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings for a complete description of legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter debt obligations    convertible notes   purchase obligations     capital lease obligations    interest payments on debt     operating leases     pension obligations    total contractual obligations    as of december   all of our notes are convertible because the closing price of our common stock on that date was higher than the restricted conversion prices of these notes 
as a result  such notes have been classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and are therefore included under the column in the table above 
in addition  our zero coupon notes first putable june  are considered to be current liabilities based on maturity 
for a discussion of our obligations under our convertible notes  see outlook indebtedness below 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs primarily in the area of research and development agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the potential milestone and other contingency payments due under current contractual agreements are million 
the table above excludes our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million as of december   since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities 
outlook we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the expected payment during of the million settlement with the us attorney s office  acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies  the settlement of outstanding litigation or the resolution  if any  of the ongoing investigation by the office of the connecticut attorney general described above  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes and regulatory or sales milestones that may become due  and or the purchase  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes  including the likely repayment in june of million of our zero coupon convertible notes 
however  we expect that sales of our currently marketed products  together with sales of our near term product candidates  assuming approval in the anticipated time frames  should allow us to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance  patent protection and exclusivity of our products  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates 
based on our current level of operations  projected sales of our existing products and estimated sales from our product candidates  if approved  combined with other revenues and interest income  we also believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the near term 
however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for future significant strategic transactions  to repay our outstanding indebtedness  particularly if such indebtedness is presented for conversion by holders see indebtedness below  or for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
marketed products and product candidates continued sales growth of provigil depends  in part  on the continued effectiveness of the various settlement agreements we entered into in late and early  as well as our maintenance of protection in the united states and abroad of the modafinil particle size patent through its expiration beginning in see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
during  we experienced a moderation in prescription growth of provigil 
we have undertaken a number of initiatives  including changes to our sales force and the initiation of direct to consumer print and web based advertising that we believe will stimulate prescription growth 
finally  growth of our modafinil based product sales in the future may depend in part on our ability to successfully launch nuvigil around the growth of our pain franchise depends in large part on our ability to successfully market fentora within its current indication and to secure fda approval of a broader labeled indication for the product outside of breakthrough cancer pain 
sales of our other pain product  actiq  have been meaningfully eroded by generic competition since september and we expect this erosion will continue into in addition  sales of our own generic otfc could be significantly impacted by the entrance into the market of additional generic otfc products  which could occur at any time 
our future growth also depends  in part  on our ability to achieve commercial success with amrix  which we launched in october  and to secure fda approval in of treanda for the treatment of patients with cll and patients with indolent b cell nhl who have progressed during or following treatment with rituximab or a rituximab containing regimen 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
in  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
we also expect to continue or begin a number of significant clinical programs including  among others possible studies of treanda for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and mantle cell lymphoma  a phase program evaluating cep for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia and other possible studies in patients with myeloproliferative disorder  and clinical programs with nuvigil focused on excessive sleepiness associated with jet lag disorder  traumatic brain injury  restless legs syndrome and remitted major depressive disorder  negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia  and bi polar depression 
we may seek to mitigate the risk in  and expense of  our research and development programs by entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties 
however  we intend to retain a portion of the commercial rights to these programs and  as a result  we still expect to spend significant funds on our share of the cost of these programs  including the costs of research  preclinical development  clinical research and manufacturing 
manufacturing  selling and marketing efforts in  we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
we expect to continue in process capital expenditure projects at our research and development facilities in france and west chester  pennsylvania 
the aggregate amount of our sales and marketing expenses in is expected to be higher than that incurred in  primarily as a result of higher expenses associated with our promotional efforts related to provigil and amrix and launch expenses associated with treanda  assuming fda approval 
indebtedness we have significant indebtedness outstanding  consisting principally of indebtedness on convertible subordinated notes 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our most significant convertible subordinated notes outstanding as of december  security outstanding conversion price redemption rights and obligations in millions convertible senior subordinated notes due june the notes generally not redeemable by the holder prior to december zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
stated conversion prices as per the terms of the notes 
however  each convertible note contains certain terms restricting a holder s ability to convert the notes  including that a holder may only convert if the closing price of our stock on the day prior to conversion is higher than  or with respect to the notes  the zero coupon notes or the zero coupon notes  respectively 
for a more complete description of these notes  including the associated convertible note hedge  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
all of our notes are convertible as of december  and  under the terms of the indentures governing the notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to repay any principal balance of notes presented for conversion  we will be required to raise additional funds 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
as of december   all of our notes are convertible because the closing price of our common stock on that date was higher than the restricted conversion prices of these notes 
as a result  such notes have been classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition  our zero coupon notes first putable june  are considered to be current liabilities based on maturity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for summary of our convertible debt  note hedge and call warrant 
as of february   the fair value of both the notes and the zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes and  as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or the zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion under the current terms 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
the annual interest payments on our convertible notes outstanding as of december  are million  payable semi annually on june and december in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or debt  or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
our notes and and zero coupon notes each are considered instrument c securities as defined by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion eitf  therefore  these notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the period  and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period 
at the time we sold our notes and zero coupon notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by increasing the effective conversion price for these notes  from our perspective  to and  respectively 
however  from an accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap perspective  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas considers only the impact of the convertible notes and the warrant agreements  since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is always anti dilutive  sfas requires that we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 
under the treasury stock method  changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price will require the inclusion of additional shares in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation total treasury stock method incremental shares 
the table also reflects the impact on the number of shares we could expect to issue upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes  the warrant and the convertible note hedge incremental shares issued by cephalon upon conversion share price convertible notes shares warrant shares total treasury stock method incremental shares shares due to cephalon under note hedge incremental shares issued by cephalon upon conversion represents the number of incremental shares that must be included in the calculation of fully diluted shares under us gaap 
represents the number of incremental shares to be issued by us upon conversion of the convertible notes  assuming concurrent settlement of the convertible note hedges and warrants 
acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue stock or raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and product launches  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates in thousands management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we develop and periodically change these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition in the united states  we sell our proprietary products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which account for of our total consolidated gross sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us may have materially affected the level of our sales in any particular period and thus our sales may not correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health 
we have distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
in the united states  we sell all commercial products fob destination 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product pass to the customer at the point that the product is received by the customer 
in europe  product sales are recognized predominantly upon customer receipt of the product  except in certain contractual arrangements where different terms may be specified 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses is recognized as an offset to those expenses in our results of operations 
we recognize revenue on new product launches when sales returns can be reasonably estimated and all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
when determining if returns can be estimated  we consider actual returns of similar products as well as sales returns with similar customers 
in cases in which a new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where we have no history of experience with products in a similar therapeutic category such that we can not estimate expected returns of the new product  we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns 
in developing estimates for sales returns  we consider inventory levels in the distribution channel  shelf life of the product and expected demand based on market data and prescriptions 
as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two to three weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
at december   we believe that inventory held at wholesalers and retailers of our generic otfc product  launched in october  is approximately three months supply 
in october  we launched amrix 
sales of amrix to wholesalers and retailers include the right of return of expired product 
based on the sales levels and the prescription data during the fourth quarter of  and based on the number of units on hand in the pipeline at december  relative to the overall demand for the products  we have estimated and recorded all applicable product sales allowances related to amrix as of december  we have therefore recognized revenues for amrix based on a fixed and determinable sales price in in september  we launched generic otfc  utilizing watson pharmaceuticals  inc as our sales agent in this effort 
we pay our sales agent a commission for these services and record this commission as selling  general and administrative expense 
in october  we launched fentora fentanyl buccal table 
c ii 
sales of our generic otfc product to wholesalers and retailers include both the right of return of expired product and retroactive price reductions under certain conditions  while sales of fentora also include the right of return of expired product 
based on the sales levels and the prescription data during the fourth quarter of  and based on the number of units on hand in the pipeline at december  relative to the overall demand for the products  we have estimated and recorded all applicable product sales allowances related to generic otfc and fentora as of december  we have therefore recognized revenues for generic otfc and fentora based on a fixed and determinable sales price in and sales of our generic otfc product could be subject to retroactive price reductions for units that remain in the pipeline if the price of generic otfc is reduced  including as a result of another generic entrant into the market  and as a result any estimated impact of such adjustments is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
this estimate of both the potential timing of a generic entrant and the amount of the price reduction is highly subjective 
at december   we are not aware of any expected additional entrants into the generic otfc market that would result in a price reduction to customers for inventory already purchased from us  and do not believe that any revenue recognized as of december  would be effected by a retroactive shelf stock adjustment 
if an additional generic entrant had occurred at the beginning of the first quarter on january   and generic otfc prices were reduced by  then a reduction of our reported revenues of million would result 
we utilize watson as our sales agent for the sales and distribution of our generic otfc 
we pay our sales agent a commission for these services and record this commission as selling  general and administrative expense 
product sales allowances we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  wholesaler discounts  returns  coupons  medicaid discounts and managed care and governmental contracts 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
in certain of the product sales allowance categories  we have calculated the impact of changes in our estimates  which we believe represent reasonably likely changes to these estimates based on historical data adjusted for certain unusual items such as changes in government contract rules 
prompt payment discounts we offer our us wholesaler customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty five days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on all us sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from our accrual amount 
wholesaler discounts we have distribution service agreements with a number of our wholesaler customers that provide our wholesalers with the opportunity to earn up to in additional discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services 
we have therefore recorded a provision equal to of us gross sales for the twelve months ended december   less inventory appreciation adjustments for price increases 
in addition  at our discretion  we may provide additional discounts to wholesalers such as the additional discount offered to wholesalers on initial stocking orders of fentora and amrix 
actual discounts provided could therefore exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected discounts 
if these discounts were to increase by of gross sales from our seven proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for provigil is three years  gabitril is two to three years  depending on product strength  and actiq and fentora are each two years 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
wholesaler customers can return short dated product with six months or less shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
retail pharmacies are not permitted to return short dated product but can return full or partial quantities of expired product only within twelve months following the expiration date 
we base our estimates of product returns for each of our products on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically 
notwithstanding this  we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could meaningfully impact our expected return percentages 
these factors could include  among others  our estimates of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  known sales trends and existing or anticipated competitive market forces such as product entrants and or pricing changes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for returns at a weighted average rate of of gross sales  which is consistent with our actual historical return percentages 
the other factors described above did not have a significant impact for the year ended december  on our estimate of product returns 
actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns activity because of several factors  including  among other things  wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and or competition 
if the returns provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our seven proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
based on fourth quarter sales  we believe a reasonable estimate of our maximum exposure for potential returns related to product in our total supply pipeline as of december  is million 
coupons we offer patients the opportunity to obtain free samples of our products through a program whereby physicians provide coupons to qualified patients for redemption at retail pharmacies 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we recognize the estimated cost of this reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons based on inventory in the distribution channel and historical coupon usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such coupon usage rates occur 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for coupons at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual coupon usage could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future coupon activity 
if the coupons provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our seven proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for medicaid discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future medicaid patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the medicaid discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our seven proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
managed care and governmental contracts we have entered into agreements with certain managed care customers whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on market share 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount rates and expected levels of market share of these managed care customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we have entered into agreements with certain governmental customers other than medicaid whereby we provide legislatively mandated discounts and rebates to such entities 
we record accruals for these discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount amounts and expected levels of performance of these governmental customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical sales amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
generally  discounts are granted to governmental customers by our wholesalers at time of purchase 
in other cases  rebates are paid directly to governmental customers based on reported levels of patient usage 
wholesalers charge these discounts and rebates back to us generally within one to three months 
we record accruals for our estimate of unprocessed chargebacks related to sales made during the period based on an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s sales  plus an accrual based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel 
we recognized a reduction in the managed care and governmental contracts allowance of million in the third quarter of  representing amounts paid to the dod under the tricare program from october through june  in october  the dod announced that it would reimburse all companies that had voluntarily made such payments under the tricare program due to the us court of appeals september ruling and we received this reimbursement in december for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for managed care and governmental contracts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual chargebacks and rebates could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
if the chargebacks and rebates provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our seven proprietary products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
the following table summarizes activity in each of the above categories for the years ended december  and prompt payment discounts wholesaler discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts managed care governmental contracts total balance at january      provision current period     prior periods   total      actual current period     prior periods      total       balance at december     provision current period     prior periods   total      actual current period     prior periods     total       balance at december     given our return goods policy  we assume that all returns in a current year relate to prior period sales

inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
cost is computed on domestic inventories and certain of our foreign inventories using the last in  first out method 
for the majority of our foreign inventories  the first in  first out method is utilized 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand and the expiration dates of inventories 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
we expense pre approval inventory unless we believe it is probable that the inventory will be saleable 
we have capitalized inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
with respect to capitalization of unapproved product candidates  we seek to produce inventory in preparation for the launch of the product and in amounts sufficient to support forecasted initial market demand 
typically  capitalization of this inventory does not begin until the product candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval 
this may occur when either the product candidate is in phase clinical trials or when it is a new formulation or dosage strength of a presently approved product for which we believe there is a high probability of receiving fda approval 
if we are aware of any specific risks or contingencies that are likely to impact the expected regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety  efficacy  manufacturing  marketing or labeling of the product candidate  we would not capitalize the related inventory 
when manufacturing and capitalizing inventory costs of product candidates and at each subsequent balance sheet date  we consider both the expiration dates of the inventory and anticipated future sales once approved 
since expiration dates are impacted by the stage of completion  we seek to avoid product expiration issues by managing the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory relative to anticipated market demand following launch 
once we have determined to capitalize inventory for a product candidate that is not yet approved  we will monitor  on a quarterly basis  the status of this candidate within the regulatory approval process 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in our judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in the timeline for commercialization or other potential factors 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate all inventory  including inventory capitalized for which regulatory approval has not yet been obtained  to determine if any lower of cost or market adjustment is required 
as it relates to pre approval inventory  we consider several factors including expected timing of fda approval  projected sales volume and estimated selling price 
projected sales volume is based on several factors including market research  sales of similar products and competition in the market 
estimated sales price is based on the price of existing products sold for the same indications and expected market demand 
at december   we had million of capitalized inventory costs related to treanda included in inventory 
in june  we secured final fda approval of nuvigil 
however  as we do not presently intend to launch nuvigil commercially until around  we have included net nuvigil inventory balances of million and million at december  and  respectively  in other assets  rather than inventory 
based on the expiration dates and our current estimates of sales demand for nuvigil  no additional reserve related to nuvigil is required at this time 
at december   we had an million inventory reserve related to the fda s determination that the sparlon snda was not approvable see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we have committed to make future minimum payments to third parties for certain raw material inventories 
the minimum purchase commitments total million as of december   the majority of which relate to modafinil and armodafinil 
we expect to fully utilize these contracts 
valuation of property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and investments our property and equipment have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
we regularly assess our property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets to determine whether any impairment in these assets may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
to do this  in the case of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
in the case of intangibles and other long lived assets  we assess whether triggering events have occurred and if so  we compare the estimated cash flows of the related asset group and compare it to the book value of the asset group 
calculating fair value as well as future cash flows requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable and reflective of common practice 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
for example  with respect to vivitrol  we currently have million of intangible assets and million of construction in progress assets as of december  the carrying value of these assets is based on our projections for future revenue growth of vivitrol 
if actual future revenue growth of the product is materially less than our projections  we may conclude that the vivitrol intangible assets and the construction in progress assets were impaired 
with respect to our durasolv intangible assets  in the third quarter of  the us patent and trademark office pto notified us that  on re examination  it has rejected the claims in the two us patents for our durasolv odt technology 
we filed notices of appeal of the pto s decisions in the fourth quarter of while we intend to vigorously defend these patents  these efforts  ultimately  may not be successful 
the invalidity of the durasolv patents could have a material adverse impact on the million carrying value of the durasolv intangible assets

income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated annual combined federal  state and foreign statutory effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets or other changes in circumstances or estimates could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period  as it has for the current year ended december  at december   we have a valuation allowance of million  against a total deferred tax asset balance of million 
this valuation allowance is composed entirely of state and foreign net operating losses  and state tax credits where we have concluded at this time that it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
we will continue to review and analyze the likelihood of realizing tax benefits related to deferred tax assets as there is more certainty surrounding our future levels of profitability related to specific company operations and the related taxing jurisdictions 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  a company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of fin on january  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgments by management and inherently includes subjectivity 
changes in estimates may create volatility in our effective tax rate in future periods due to settlements with various tax authorities either favorable or unfavorable  the expiration of the statute of limitations on some tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of sfas r for a all share based payments granted after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
sfas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model when assessing the fair value of stock options granted 
the black scholes option pricing model requires several inputs  one of which is volatility 
the fair value of stock options is most sensitive to the volatility input 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded stock options on our stock 
to the extent volatility of our stock price or the option market on our stock increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of stock options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
for instance  an increase in estimated volatility of ten percentage points would have resulted in additional annual pre tax stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future or actual experience differs from this estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
an estimated forfeiture rate of one percentage point lower would have resulted in an insignificant increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  beginning with our december stock option grant  our expected term of stock options granted was derived from our historical data as we have assumed that our historical stock option exercise experience is a relevant indicator of future exercise patterns 
prior to the december stock option grant  our expected term of stock options granted was derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in sec s staff accounting bulletin no

r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs  in process research and development and restructuring costs 
in addition  under sfas r  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early application is not permitted 
the effect of sfas r on our consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the nature and terms of any business combinations that occur after its effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin no 
to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements unless a future transaction results in a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the year ended december   an average weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our european subsidiaries operate would have resulted in an increase of million in reported total revenues and a corresponding increase in reported expenses 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our european subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  since all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate 
our investments are classified as short term and as available for sale 
we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities
