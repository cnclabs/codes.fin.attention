item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets and where necessary  includes specific references to awr s individual segments and or other subsidiaries gswc  ccwc  asus and its subsidiaries 
overview registrant s revenues  operating income  and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses through approximately  miles of water distribution pipelines 
rates charged to customers of gswc and ccwc are determined by the cpuc and acc  respectively 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors recently affecting financial performance include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  the ability to recover  and the process for recovering in rates  the costs of distributing water and electricity  weather  the impact of increased water quality standards on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems and increased costs and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by registrant to protect its water supply and delays in receiving payments from the us government and the filing for redetermination and equitable adjustment of prices under contracts with the us government 
registrant plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
cash solely from operations is not expected to be sufficient to fund registrant s needs for capital expenditures  dividends  investments in registrant s contract business and other cash requirements 
registrant expects to fund a portion of these needs through a combination of debt and common stock offerings in the ensuing years 
awr expects to issue equity in  which will be included in the rate setting process 
operating revenues and income from contracted services at asus and its subsidiaries are earned primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems for the us government at various military bases 
all of the operations and maintenance contracts with the us government are year firm  fixed price contracts with prospective price redeterminations 
asus also may generate revenues from the construction of infrastructure improvements at these bases pursuant to the terms of these year contracts or pursuant to supplemental contracts 
revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on these new business activities  including military base operations and the construction of new and or replacement infrastructure at these military bases 
as a result  asus is subject to risks that are different than those of registrant s regulated water and electric activities 
asus plans to continue seeking contracts for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater services at military bases 
for  net income was million compared to million in  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share for were compared to in one reason for this increase is the derivative accounting required for the purchased power contracts at gswc s bear valley electric service bves division 
unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts have been impacting gswc s earnings since when gswc entered into certain purchase power contracts 
these contracts qualified as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
due to increasing energy prices  the pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts of million increased net income by per share during in contrast to a pretax unrealized loss of million which decreased net income by per share for the same period of the net effect was an increase in net income of million  or per share  between the two periods 
the purpose of the purchased power contract  which qualifies as a derivative instrument  is to stabilize registrant s purchased power costs 
the power purchased under the contract is only used to service electric customers demand and registrant does not engage in trading of purchased power 
although the unrealized gains and losses result in significant fluctuations to the income statement  there is no effect on registrant s cash flows 
when analyzing the financial performance of awr  registrant excludes the effect of unrealized derivative gains or losses  as they are not reflective of day to day operations 
the unrealized derivative gains and losses are reflective of changes in future electricity costs that are outside of management s control 
eliminating the effects of unrealized derivative gains and losses on purchased power contracts  diluted earnings per share for would have actually decreased by per share as compared to several operating reasons which are responsible for this overall decrease are discussed below in more detail  including a favorable decision issued by the cpuc on april  regarding gswc s water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom  which generated a one time revenue increase in this cpuc decision added about million of additional revenues  or per share  in the first quarter of for amounts that had been received from the city of folsom in and there was no such one time revenue recognition amount in based on the decision  gswc has recorded the on going annual folsom lease revenues of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
summary results by segment awr has three reportable segments water  electric and contracted services 
within the segments  awr has three principal business units water and electric service utility operations conducted through gswc  a water service utility operation conducted through ccwc  and a contracted services unit conducted through asus and its subsidiaries 
the tables below set forth summaries of the results by segment in thousands for the years ended december  and operating revenues pretax operating income year year year year ended ended ended ended change change change change water electric contracted services awr parent totals from operation water for the year ended december   pretax operating income for water increased by million  or  compared to the same period in  as a result of a million increase in water margin as compared to the same period of due to increased water rates approved by the cpuc that were effective january  and a favorable change in the water supply mix 
this comparative increase was partially offset by the non recurrence in of a favorable decision issued by the cpuc on april  regarding gswc s water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom  which generated a one time revenue increase in this decision added about million of additional revenues in the first quarter of for amounts that had been received from the city of folsom in and prior to the decision  these amounts had been recorded as regulatory liabilities 
there was no such one time revenue recognition amount in based on the decision  gswc has recorded the on going annual folsom lease revenues of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in margin for compared to was also partially offset by higher operating  maintenance  administrative and general  and other expenses  which decreased pretax operating income by million  as more fully described below 
electric for the year ended december   pretax operating income for electric increased by million  due in large part to an unrealized gain on bves purchased power contracts during the year ended december  as a result of increasing energy prices versus an unrealized loss on purchased power contracts in the same period of  as previously discussed 
the unrealized gain for the year ended december  increased operating income by approximately million as compared to an unrealized loss decreasing operating income by million for the same period in the net effect was an increase in electric operating income of million between the two periods 
without the effects of the derivative  pretax electric operating income decreased by million in due to a  decrease in electric margin caused by lower consumption and the recording of a regulatory liability of approximately  with a corresponding reduction in electric revenues for probable refunds to customers related to the mw natural gas fueled generation plant 
in april  new customer rates went into effect related to this generation plant  which resulted in an increase of approximately million in annual revenue based on an estimated total capital related cost of million 
the rates are subject to refund pending the cpuc s final cost review  which is scheduled to occur in as part of the filing of bves s general rate case 
the cpuc also ordered gswc to establish a memorandum account to track the capital related costs of the generation plant 
if actual recorded costs in the memorandum account are less than the costs authorized by the cpuc of million  the revenue requirement for the difference is to be refunded to customers 
during the third quarter of  gswc received vendor credits of approximately  which reduced the actual recorded costs of the generation plant below million 
finally  increases in maintenance  depreciation  administrative and general  and other operating expenses further decreased electric s pretax operating income by million 
contracted services for the year ended december   pretax operating income for contracted services increased by million 
this was primarily due to the supplemental construction contract for improvements to the existing wastewater infrastructure located at fort bliss associated with a wastewater expansion project 
as a result of this construction project  pretax operating income increased by million during the project was completed in august and there will be no further construction revenues associated with this project 
the year over year increase to pretax income due to this project was partially offset by other non recurring construction projects that were completed in earnings and cash flows from amendments or supplements to the original year contracts with the us government are sporadic and may or may not continue in future periods 
revenues from contracted services are comprised of management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems o m at the military bases  construction revenues for contractual renewal and replacements r r and initial capital upgrades icus of the existing infrastructure facilities  and construction revenues under firm fixed and cost plus arrangements for projects requested by the us government beyond those identified in the year privatization contract 
while the on going r r  icu s and supplemental construction activities have produced positive operating income results from the cost plus and firm fixed construction contracts  the o m aspect of the business has resulted in shrinking margins  and in some cases losses  due primarily to delays in filing timely price redeterminations and equitable adjustments 
registrant s contract pricing on each of the contracts was based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  the condition of the systems and the actual amount of assets being operated and maintained 
the contract price for each of these military contracts is subject to price redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
however  asus has experienced delays in the redetermination of prices at fort bliss following completion of the first two years of operation in october and expects delays in redetermination of prices at bases in virginia and maryland following the completion of the first two years of operations in february delays may also occur at additional bases in virginia following completion of the first two years of operations in april at fort bliss  management fees for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems  which were based on cost levels prevailing in when the contract was first being negotiated  have not been adjusted as yet to adequately cover increased operating costs 
further  the contract pricing was also based on assumptions about the size and age of the infrastructure being operated and maintained over the year contract 
an adjustment is necessary to adequately reflect the amount of assets included in the infrastructure at fort bliss  which is substantially more than originally estimated by the us government as part of its solicitation for this contract 
price redeterminations are expected to occur in at fort bliss  the four bases in virginia and andrews air force base 
these price redeterminations  which should include adjustments to reflect changes in operating conditions and infrastructure levels from that assumed at the time of the execution of the contracts as well as inflation in costs  are expected to provide added revenues prospectively to help offset increased costs and provide registrant the opportunity to generate positive operating income from o m activities 
also partially offsetting the increase in pretax operating income due to construction activities  was the non recurrence of recovery and reimbursement in of transition period operating expenses of about  as a result of operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at military bases in virginia and maryland pursuant to the contracts with the us government commencing during asus took over the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at andrews air force base in maryland on february  and commenced operation of these systems on that date 
in addition  asus assumed the operation and maintenance of the wastewater systems at fort lee in virginia on february  and the water and wastewater systems at fort eustis  fort monroe and fort story in virginia on april  and commenced operation and maintenance of these systems on those dates 
therefore  asus operated these bases partially during and entirely during as well  final decisions on the general rate case for gswc s region ii and the application to recover general office expenses at the corporate headquarters allocated to regions ii and iii were approved on november  the decisions also imposed an increased allocation of corporate headquarters expenses to the military utility privatization subsidiaries  which decreased contracted services pretax operating income by an additional  this higher allocation of expenses was not contemplated at the time the contracts for fbws  odus and tus were negotiated 
consolidated results of operations years ended december  and dollars in thousands year year ended ended change change operating revenues water electric contracted services total operating revenues operating expenses water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment power purchased for resale unrealized gain loss on purchased power contracts supply cost balancing accounts other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization maintenance property and other taxes construction expenses net gain on disposal of property total operating expenses operating income other income and expenses interest expense interest income other income from operations before income tax expense income tax expense net income net income for the year ended december  increased by to million  equivalent to and per common share on a basic and fully diluted basis  respectively  compared to million or and per basic and diluted common shares  respectively  for the year ended december  impacting the comparability in the results of the two periods are the following significant items there was an unrealized gain on purchased power contracts in due to increasing energy prices versus an unrealized loss on purchased power contracts in the cumulative unrealized gain on purchased power contracts increased pretax income by approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared to a cumulative unrealized loss on purchased power contracts that decreased pretax income by million  or per share in a decision issued by the cpuc on april  regarding the accounting treatment of gswc s water rights lease revenues  increased pretax operating income by about million in march  or approximately per share  when compared to the same period in pursuant to a march cpuc order  the apportionment of any folsom lease revenues that gswc may collect commencing in january was to be determined by a later decision 
pending that later decision and beginning in the first quarter of  all amounts billed to the city of folsom had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were recognized as revenue until uncertainties about this matter were resolved with the cpuc 
on april   the cpuc authorized gswc to reinvest all lease revenues since january  inclusive of the balances in the regulatory liability accounts established by gswc for this matter  in water system infrastructure 
these investments will be included in the rate base upon which gswc earns a rate of return 
in accordance with california law  gswc has eight years in which to reinvest the proceeds  after which any amount remaining would inure to the customer s benefit 
as a result  in the first quarter of  gswc transferred about million of water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom in and from the regulatory liability account  into water revenues 
an increase  excluding the million of water right lease revenues as discussed above  in the margin for the water segment of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of due to increased water rates approved by the cpuc that were effective january   an increase in water consumption over that in the prior period  and a favorable supply mix change 
an increase in pretax operating income from contracted services at asus of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of for operating  maintaining and improving the water and wastewater systems at military bases for the us government 
the increases include revenue recognized for certain special projects under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
an increase in gswc s other operating and maintenance expenses of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of  resulting from higher chemical and water treatment costs along with an increase in required and emergency maintenance on gswc s wells and water supply sources 
higher other expenses primarily consisting of administrative and general expenses  a change in the effective income tax rate  as well as other items described below  contributed to an overall decrease of per basic share to the results of operations 
operating revenues water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  contributing to this increase were rate increases approved by the cpuc effective january   which added approximately million in to water revenues 
included in the rate increases for were million for region ii and million to recover general office expenses allocated to region iii 
these increases were approved by the cpuc on november  and were retroactive to january  in addition  an increase of about in the volume of billed water consumption resulting from much warmer and drier weather conditions increased revenues by approximately million 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
partially offsetting these increases was the fact that operating revenues for were positively impacted by a cpuc decision issued on april  enabling gswc to record million of water rights lease revenues from the city of folsom for the period from january to december prior to this decision  the apportionment of any lease revenues that gswc collected in and had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were recognized as revenues until regulatory uncertainties about this matter were resolved 
there was no such adjustment in in addition  the increases in revenues are partially offset by the expiration in october of the surcharge that was in rates to recover region iii s under collection in supply costs 
this decrease in revenues is offset by a corresponding amount in the supply cost balancing accounts discussed below  resulting in no impact to pretax operating income 
electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to lower electric usage and the recording of a regulatory liability of approximately  with a corresponding decrease in revenues  for probable refunds to customers related to the mw natural gas fueled generation plant  previously discussed in the segment results 
contracted services revenues from contracted services are comprised of construction revenues and management fees for operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems at military bases 
for the year ended december   revenues from contracted services increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase of approximately million related to construction revenues earned from the us government and recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the revenues earned were for the construction of certain improvements  renewals and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructure at fort bliss and at the military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to new contracts entered into in early certain of the construction projects are fixed price contracts and are supplements to asus year contracts with the us government 
in particular  asus entered into a million project for the construction of certain improvements to the existing wastewater infrastructure located at fort bliss in el paso  texas 
the project was a firm fixed price contract and was an amendment and supplement to the year contract with the us government to manage the entire water and wastewater systems at fort bliss 
revenues from this agreement have been recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
as a result of this new project  which began in early  revenues for contracted services increased by million during the project was completed in august and there will be no further construction revenues associated with this project 
the year over year revenue increase resulting from this project was partially offset by the non recurrence of revenues for other one time construction projects that were completed in earnings and cash flows from amendments and modifications to the original year contracts with the us government are sporadic and may or may not continue in the future periods 
there were also additional management fee revenues totaling  during generated from operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under the new contracts in virginia and maryland 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in management fees totaling  related to contracts with various municipalities to provide billing and meter reading services 
effective january   asus assigned these service contracts with the various municipalities to gswc 
these management fees are now earned by gswc so there was no impact on registrant s consolidated earnings as a result of this assignment 
registrant relies upon rate approvals by state regulatory agencies in california and arizona and price redeterminations and equitable adjustments by the us government in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without such adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  operating revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
operating expenses supply costs supply costs for the water segment consist of purchased water  purchased power for pumping  groundwater production assessments and water supply cost balancing accounts 
supply costs for the electric segment consist of purchased power for resale and the electric supply cost balancing account 
water and electric margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the utility business performance within its water and electric segments 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to our operating budget as approved 
however  this measure  which is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  which is determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
total supply costs comprise the largest segment of total operating expenses 
supply costs accounted for approximately and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below provides the amount of increases decreases  percent changes in supply costs  and margins during the years ended december  and amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water operating revenues water supply costs water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment water supply cost balancing accounts total water supply costs water margin percent margin water electric operating revenues electric supply costs power purchased for resale electric supply cost balancing accounts total electric supply costs electric margin percent margin electric as reported on awr s consolidated statements of income  except for supply cost balancing accounts 
the sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on awr s consolidated statements of income and totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
water and electric margins do not include any depreciation and amortization  maintenance expense  unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts  or other operating expenses 
two of the principal factors affecting water supply costs and gross margin are the amount of water produced and the source of the water 
generally  the variable cost of producing water from wells is less than the cost of water purchased from wholesale suppliers 
in addition  gswc is authorized to establish water and electric supply cost balancing accounts for increases and or decreases in costs due to changes in rates charged by its suppliers which provide our purchased water and purchased power  and by agencies assessing groundwater related pump taxes for our water service areas in california 
higher or lower actual costs as compared to costs authorized by the cpuc will either be recovered from or refunded to customers in the future 
however  changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to the mix approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
gswc has the opportunity to change the supply related costs recovered through rates  by application to the cpuc through a general rate case proceeding 
gswc believes that its applications for recovery of supply related costs accurately reflect the water supply situation as it is known at the time 
without a full cost balancing account authorized by the cpuc  earnings may fluctuate from adverse changes in supply costs related to unforeseen contamination or other loss of water supply 
for the year ended december   of the company s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  this change in mix resulted in improved margins in compared to the same period in water gross margin for the year ended december  included the million water rights lease revenues from the city of folsom 
without the million water rights lease revenues in  water gross margin for the year ended december  would have been purchased water costs for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to higher water rates charged by wholesale suppliers and higher customer consumption 
in general  the supply cost balancing account as discussed above allows gswc to track incremental rate changes from suppliers  for future recovery in water rates 
these increases in purchased water costs were offset by a favorable change in the supply mix discussed above 
the favorable change in supply mix allowed gswc to serve a portion of the increased customer demand from groundwater production rather than wholesale purchases  primarily because of the return to service or replacement of wells which had been removed from service in as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems 
for the year ended december   the increases in power purchased for pumping and groundwater production assessments were due to higher customer demand and an increase in pumping volume resulting from the favorable supply mix change as discussed 
there were also increases in assessment rates pump tax rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in region ii and iii by approximately and  respectively 
again  the supply cost balancing account tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
the supply cost balancing account tracks differences between the current cost for supply items water  power  and pump taxes charged by gswc s suppliers and the cost for those items incorporated into gswc s rates 
overcollections occur when the current cost of these items is less than the amount in rates which has the effect of increasing the supply cost balancing account in the statements of income 
undercollections occur when the current cost exceeds the amount in rates for these items and  conversely  will have the effect of decreasing the supply cost balancing account in the statements of income 
typically  overcollections or undercollections  when they occur  are tracked in the supply cost balancing accounts for future refund or recovery through a surcredit in the event of an overcollection or surcharge in the event of an undercollection on customers bills 
once in rates  the amortization of surcharges that are in place to recover under collections from customers have the effect of increasing the supply cost balancing account and increasing revenues in the statements of income  resulting in no earnings impact 
conversely  the amortization of surcredits that are in rates to refund over collections to customers have the effect of decreasing the supply cost balancing account and decreasing revenues  also resulting in no earnings impact 
a decrease of  during in the water supply cost balancing account provision as compared to was primarily caused by a million decrease due to the expiration in october of the surcharge that was in rates to recover previously incurred supply costs in gswc s region iii service areas 
this decrease was partially offset by an overall increase of million in the provision as compared to the same period of on november   the cpuc approved general rate case increases  retroactive to january   for gswc s region ii service area 
the decision reflects the revenue requirement for supply costs that included recent rate increases from gswc s suppliers 
as a result  there was less undercollection in supply costs to record as compared to  resulting in an increase to the supply cost balancing account as discussed 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division decreased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting primarily lower customer demand and kilowatt hour usage 
unrealized gain loss on purchased power contracts unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represent gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with pinnacle west marketing trading company  llc pwmt formerly pinnacle west capital corporation  which qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
in june  pwmt sold many of its wholesale power contracts to morgan stanley capital group  inc mscg 
the sale included the contract between pwmt and gswc 
gswc was notified by pwmt about the sale of its contracts  and in september an assignment agreement was executed by gswc  pwmt and mscg that became effective november  the assignment agreement retained the identical terms and conditions of the original contract 
the million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to an increase in the current forward market prices since december  there was a million pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  unrealized gains and losses at bves will continue to impact earnings positively or negatively during the life of the contract  which terminates at the end of as of december   there is an accumulated unrealized loss of million which will be recognized in income by december  other operating expenses the components of other operating expenses include primarily payroll  materials and supplies  chemicals and water treatment  and contract service costs of operating the regulated water systems  including the costs associated with water transmission and distribution  pumping  water quality  meter reading  billing  and operations of district offices 
for the years ended december  and  other operating expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total other operating expenses for the year ended december   other operating expenses for water services increased by million due primarily to higher chemicals and water treatment costs  including supplies and materials  of million in particular at gswc s region ii and iii services areas 
region ii incurred additional costs primarily for the removal of arsenic and volatile organic compounds at six of its wells  while region iii incurred additional costs primarily for two of its treatment plants 
there was also an increase in labor costs of  due to higher wages and related benefits  and an increase of  in conservation costs at gswc s region ii service area 
in  gswc began expensing conservation costs in region ii pursuant to an agreement reached with the cpuc during its recent general rate case 
some of the region ii conservation expenses were recovered in rates 
previously  conservation costs in region ii were capitalized and recovered in rate base 
these expense increases in were offset  in part  by a decrease of  in bad debt expense 
there was also an increase in other operating expenses of million for contracted services primarily due to the commencement of the operation of water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia 
asus operated these bases during the full year ended december   whereas  with service commencement dates in the first four months of  they were only operated by asus during part of other operating expenses increased by approximately  at these bases 
there was also an increase of  in bad debt expense primarily related to aged accounts receivable balances from the us government 
as of december   approximately million of amounts due from the us government is significantly past due 
asus has been working and continues to work with us government personnel to effect payment of these amounts 
should these efforts be unsuccessful in whole or in part  asus  pursuant to federal regulations  is permitted to file and anticipates filing claims with the respective contracting officer for payment of these amounts 
if these claims are rejected by the contracting officer  asus may appeal the denial to either the armed services board of contract appeals or the united states court of federal claims 
asus will continue to make every effort to collect any and all amounts legitimately due from the us government 
administrative and general expenses administrative and general expenses include payroll related to administrative and general functions  all employee benefits charged to expense accounts  insurance expenses  outside legal and consulting fees  regulatory utility commission expenses  expenses associated with being a public company  and general corporate expenses 
for the years ended december  and  administrative and general expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total administrative and general expenses for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by million in water and electric services compared to the year ended december  due primarily to i an increase of  in outside services relating primarily to additional tax  accounting and legal services  ii an approximate million increase in labor costs due to higher wages largely related to registrant s annual performance based salary review program  iii an agreement with the city of folsom to dismiss all opposition to gswc s providing service to the proposed westborough development  the agreement requires gswc to pay the city of folsom  with aerojet reimbursing gswc for  or  of the settlement payment  as of and for the year ended december   gswc has recorded an obligation to the city of folsom for  an additional receivable of  from aerojet for the amount to be reimbursed and a net charge to administrative and general expenses in the amount of  for its share of the settlement payment  iv an increase in insurance premiums of approximately  v a  increase in rent expense for office space and the telephone system  vi an increase in regulatory commission expenses of approximately  and vii a  net increase in other miscellaneous expenses primarily related to bank fees  postage  supplies and other general corporate expenses 
these increases were offset by a decrease of  in pension costs as a result of favorable changes to actuarial assumptions 
there was also an increase of million in contracted services administrative and general expenses due primarily to i the recovery in of transition period operating expenses of about  at the various military bases pursuant to the contracts with the us government  there was no such recovery in  ii an increase of approximately  in outside services including legal and consulting costs  iii an approximate  increase in labor and employee benefit costs  and iv an increase of  in allocation from the corporate headquarters to the military utility privatization subsidiaries 
a final decision on the general rate case for gswc s region ii and the application to cover general office expenses allocated to regions ii and iii were approved on november  and imposed an increased allocation of corporate headquarters expenses to contracted services 
this adjustment was retroactive to january  and was made in the fourth quarter of  thus negatively impacting contracted services pretax income and positively impacting water and electric services pretax income by the same amount 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of closing approximately million of additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
maintenance for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to an increase in planned and emergency maintenance on gswc s water supply and distribution facilities 
a significantly higher than anticipated number of water main repairs were completed during  many of which were attributed to much colder than average temperatures reacting with the cast iron pipe materials in older sections of gswc s distribution system 
in january  gswc s largest distribution system in los angeles county experienced over leaks due to the colder than normal temperatures 
in addition to the increase in repairs to the distribution systems owned by gswc  an increased effort in was focused on planned maintenance of fire hydrants  gate valves and flushing dead end water lines compared to gswc also experienced an increase in planned and unplanned maintenance of its water supply sources  namely company owned wells 
many planned well treatment and rehabilitation projects were deferred in due to unanticipated water quality and mechanical problems in many wells discussed above 
in  a number of new wells and treatment facilities were placed into service allowing gswc to continue with the well maintenance projects originally scheduled for without experiencing a decline in groundwater production 
in general  well and pump maintenance expenses continue to increase due to rising labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
these maintenance increases are included in each general rate case and are generally recovered in rates 
however  amounts included in each general rate case are estimated for future years and overages from those estimates may not be covered in rates 
property and other taxes for the year ended december   property and other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
construction expenses for the year ended december   asus construction expenses increased to million compared to million for the same period in reflecting the costs incurred for the construction of various improvements  renewals and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructures at fort bliss and at the military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to new contracts entered into in early the increase in construction activity resulted from amendments to the original year contracts with the us government which required the construction of additional improvements at the various military bases 
as previously mentioned  asus entered into a million project for the construction of certain improvements to the existing wastewater infrastructure located at fort bliss in el paso  texas 
as a result of this new project  construction expenses increased by million during the project was completed in august the increase in construction expenses because of this project was partially offset by other non recurring construction projects that were completed in net gain on disposal of property for the year ended december   registrant recorded a net pretax gain of  on the disposal of property 
this gain includes a settlement of  reached with the los angeles unified school district in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land for the purpose of constructing a high school 
this parcel of land had not been used for a number of years in gswc s public utility operations 
in addition  there was a gain of  related to the sale of property in the city of claremont 
earnings and cash flows from these transactions are sporadic and may or may not continue in future periods 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  primarily reflecting higher interest rates 
there was also an increase in short term borrowings 
average bank loan balances outstanding under an awr credit facility for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to an average of million during the same period of interest income interest income decreased by  for the year ended december  due primarily to the initial recording in the first quarter of of interest accrued on the uncollected balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account authorized by the cpuc 
as a result  the interest income accrued on the memorandum account decreased by  between the two periods 
in addition  interest income decreased reflecting the receipt of interest amounting to  related to a million internal revenue service refund received in may these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest earned on short term cash surplus 
other for the years ended december  and  registrant recorded other income of  and  respectively  as a result of its ownership interest in a non operating equity investment 
income tax expense for the year ended december   income tax expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due  in part  to an increase in pretax income of 
in addition  the effective tax rate etr for the year ended december  was as compared to a etr applicable to the year ended december  the variance between the etr and the statutory tax rate primarily results from differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the increase in the etr in is principally due to a net increase in compensatory related flow through adjustments 
flow through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period  with an offsetting increase or decrease occurring in another period 
in addition  during the third quarter of  awr filed an amended tax return for with the irs which was subject to irs and congressional joint committee of taxation jct review 
during the second quarter of  the irs and jct reviews were completed and awr received a refund in the amount of its original claim of million  with interest 
consequently  in the second quarter of  awr recorded a tax benefit of  of which  was attributable to gswc

gswc was authorized to collect the balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account of approximately million  through a rate surcharge  which will continue for no longer than years 
as a result of this decision  in july gswc recorded an increase of approximately million to the aerojet regulatory asset to include previously expensed carrying and other costs  and recorded a corresponding pre tax gain 
in addition  gswc was ordered to restore to the appropriate plant accounts  those amounts that have been reimbursed by aerojet pursuant to the settlement 
this resulted in gswc recording an approximate million decrease to depreciation expense during the third quarter of there were no similar entries during the year ended december  the following is a summary of the impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  resulting from this decision in thousands amount operating expenses increase decrease power purchased for resale other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization total pre tax impact to operating expenses interest interest expense interest income total net interest charges total pre tax impact to results of operations impact to taxes on income total impact to net income impact to basic earnings per share impact to diluted earnings per share there was an unrealized loss on purchased power contracts in due to decreasing energy prices versus an unrealized gain on purchased power contracts in the cumulative unrealized loss on purchased power contracts decreased pretax income by approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared to a cumulative unrealized gain on purchased power contracts that increased pretax income by million  or per share increase to income  for the same period in eliminating the effects of the two items discussed above  basic and diluted earnings per share for would have increased by per share as compared to  resulting primarily from the following a decision issued by the cpuc on april  regarding the treatment of gswc s water rights lease revenues added about million to pretax income for the year ended december  or approximately per share 
in this decision  the cpuc authorized gswc to reinvest all lease revenues since january  inclusive of the balances in the regulatory liability accounts established by gswc for this matter  in water system infrastructure 
these investments will be included in the rate base upon which gswc earns a rate of return 
in accordance with california law  gswc will have years in which to reinvest the proceeds 
as a result  gswc transferred about million of water rights lease revenues received from the city of folsom in and from the regulatory liability account into other operating revenues 
gswc also recorded pretax income of million reflecting water rights lease revenues for the year ended december  water rate increases contributed approximately million to revenues  or per share for the year ended december  this was partially offset by higher expenses as described below 
an increase in pretax operating income from contracted services at asus of million  or per share  as compared to the same period of by operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems for the us government 
the increases included revenue recognized for certain special projects and reimbursement of various operating costs incurred during the period of transition of the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia formerly owned and operated by the us government 
a million increase in interest income  excluding the impact of the aerojet decision in july mentioned above  or per share  resulting from interest accrued on the uncollected balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account authorized by the cpuc and interest income related to a million internal revenue service refund received in may a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by per share resulting primarily from i a  tax benefit relating to a million irs refund received in may  and ii differences between book and taxable income  which are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
higher operating expenses as described below 
operating revenues water for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  higher water revenues reflect rate increases since covering almost all water customers  which contributed million in increased revenues 
in addition  an increase of about in billed water consumption resulting from changes in weather conditions between the two periods  also increased revenues by approximately million 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
furthermore  there was an increase of million in gswc s water revenues due to a decision issued by the cpuc on april  enabling gswc to record million  or  of water rights lease revenues from the city of folsom from january to december prior to this decision  the apportionment of any lease revenues that gswc collected in and  totaling million  had been included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts were recognized as revenues until regulatory uncertainties about this matter were resolved 
registrant also recorded additional revenue of million  reflecting the annual water rights lease revenues 
electric for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects primarily a increase in kilowatt hour kwh usage  due to changes in weather conditions which caused the usage of snow making machines to increase in the cooler winter weather as compared to the same period in the prior year allowed the ski resorts industrial customers to remain open well into may  operating their lifts and some snow making in the evening hours 
new rates authorized by the cpuc for the investment in an megawatt mw natural gas fueled generation facility also contributed to the increase 
the new rates went into effect on april  and have generated approximately million in additional annual revenues  subject to refund pending the cpuc s final cost review 
registrant relies upon rate approvals by state regulatory agencies in california and arizona in order to recover operating expenses and provide for a fair return on invested and borrowed capital used to fund utility plant 
without adequate rate relief granted in a timely manner  revenues and earnings can be negatively impacted 
contracted services for the year ended december   revenues from contract services increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to an increase of million related to construction revenues with the us government based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for the construction of certain improvements  renewal and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructures at fort bliss and at the new military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to new military contracts entered into in early some of the construction projects in were firm fixed price contracts and supplemental to asus year contracts with the us government 
there were also additional revenues totaling million generated from operating and maintaining the water and wastewater systems under the new military contracts in virginia and maryland 
operating expenses supply costs for general discussion on supply costs  see discussion in the versus results 
supply costs accounted for approximately and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below provides the amount of increases decreases  percent changes in supply costs  and margins during the years ended december  and amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water operating revenues water supply costs water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment water supply cost balancing accounts total water supply costs water margin percent margin water electric operating revenues electric supply costs power purchased for resale electric supply cost balancing accounts total electric supply costs electric margin percent margin electric as reported on awr s consolidated statements of income  except for supply cost balancing accounts 
the sum of water and electric supply cost balancing accounts in the table above are shown on awr s consolidated statements of income and totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
water and electric margins do not include any depreciation and amortization  maintenance expense  unrealized gains and losses on purchased power contracts  or other operating expenses 
for the year ended december   of the company s water supply mix was purchased as compared to purchased for the year ended december  this change in mix resulted in improved percent margins in compared to the same period in in addition  water gross margin for the year ended december  included the million water rights lease revenues from the city of folsom 
without the million of water rights lease revenues in  water gross margin for the year ended december  would have been 
furthermore  water gross margin for the year ended december  included million under collections approved by the cpuc in related to region iii s supply cost memorandum accounts  which reduced the expense 
without the million in  water gross margin for the year ended december  would have been for the year ended december   purchased water costs decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to a change in the supply mix caused by less purchased water needed to replace groundwater supply lost in due to wells being removed from service 
the wells were removed from service in as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in gswc s foothill district 
the cost of purchased water in this district decreased by approximately million as a result of the wells being returned to operation in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in customer demand resulting from higher consumption and increased water rates by imported water suppliers 
for the year ended december   the increases in power purchased for pumping and groundwater production assessments were due to higher water supply demand and an increase in pumping volume resulting from the favorable supply mix change as previously discussed 
there were also increases in assessment rates pump tax rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in regions ii and iii in july by approximately and  respectively  and and in july  respectively 
again  the supply cost balancing account tracks the increases in pump tax rates for future recovery in water rates 
for a general discussion on increases and decreases to the supply cost balancing accounts in the statements of income  see versus results 
for the year ended december   the provision for water supply cost balancing accounts increased by million as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the approval by the cpuc and recording in june and october of million under collections related to region iii s supply cost memorandum accounts  which reduced the expense 
gswc began recording under and over collections on a monthly basis for pursuant to a cpuc decision issued in this increase as compared to was partially offset by a million net decrease in the provision for water supply cost balancing accounts due to an increase in under collections in for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bves division increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting higher customer demand during the year ended december  in addition  in november of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ordered mirant americas energy marketing mirant marketing to reimburse  of the amount gswc had refunded to mirant marketing in previous years 
gswc received and recorded the reimbursement of  plus interest  from mirant marketing in may of gswc recorded the mirant marketing reimbursement in its supply cost balancing account which also resulted in no net impact on earnings in there was also a net decrease of  in the electric supply cost balancing account due to an increase in net under collections of  for  and the refund payment of  received in from mirant marketing for purchased energy cost 
unrealized loss gain on purchased power contracts the million pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  was due to a decrease in the then current forward market prices since december  there was a million pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  unrealized gains and losses at bves will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwmt assigned to morgan stanley capital group  inc in which terminates in as a result  gswc has recognized these contracts at fair market value on its balance sheets resulting in a cumulative unrealized loss of million as of december  gains or losses on these contracts will be recognized in earnings through the expiration of the contracts on december  other operating expenses for the years ended december  and  other operating expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total other operating expenses for the year ended december   other operating expenses for water services increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i a  downward adjustment in july of reflecting the approval from the cpuc of previously incurred operating expenses in the aerojet matter  previously discussed  ii higher chemicals and water treatment costs of  iii an increase of  in bad debt expense relating to miscellaneous accounts receivable balances  and iv approximately  of higher other operating material and service expenses 
there was also an increase in other operating expenses of million for contracted services primarily due to higher operating expenses of million at odus and tus due to the commencement of operation of the water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia in early these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other operating expenses at fbws of  due primarily to an increase in reimbursements from the us government and contractors  for operating expenses incurred at fort bliss 
administrative and general expenses for the years ended december  and  administrative and general expenses by segment consisted of the following amounts in thousands year year ended ended change change water services electric services contracted services total administrative and general expenses for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses for water and electric services increased by million primarily due to increases in i pensions and benefits of  caused by actuarial assumption changes in the mortality tables  ii stock based compensation expense of  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   iii labor cost increases of  due to higher wages  and iv various other benefits  office  supplies and rent expenses of  administrative and general expenses decreased by  for contracted services due to i an increase of  in reimbursements by the us government of indirect costs incurred by fbws  and ii lower outside services and other expenses at asus totaling  these decreases were offset by higher administrative and general expenses of approximately  at odus and tus due to the commencement of operation of the water and wastewater systems at military bases in maryland and virginia in early this increase at odus and tus is net of the recovery of transition period operating expenses of about  at these military bases 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of closing approximately million of additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january in addition  there was a decrease in depreciation expense in resulting from the favorable cpuc decision on the aerojet matter  discussed previously  which ordered gswc to restore approximately million to the appropriate plant accounts and decrease depreciation expense in july of there was no such adjustment in finally  there was an increase in ccwc s depreciation expense of  as a result of new rates approved by the acc that went into effect october  registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
maintenance for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to an increase in required maintenance on gswc s wells and water supply sources in all regions 
there were also increases in well treatment and emergency repair costs 
furthermore  there was an increase in maintenance expense of i  at gswc s electric division due to the new mw natural gas fueled generation facility  and ii  at odus and tus due to the commencement of the operations of the water and wastewater systems pursuant to new military contracts in maryland and virginia 
property and other taxes for the year ended december   property and other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
construction expenses for the year ended december   asus construction expenses increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting the costs incurred for the construction of various improvements  renewals and replacements to the existing water and wastewater infrastructures at fort bliss and at the military bases located in virginia and maryland pursuant to new military contracts entered into in early the increase resulted from amendments to the original year contracts with the us government which required the construction of additional improvements at the various military bases 
net gain on disposal of property for the year ended december   registrant recorded a net pretax gain of  on the sale of non utility property 
there was no similar gain in the same period of gain on settlement for removal of wells for the year ended december   registrant also recorded a net pre tax gain of  on a settlement reached with the fountain hills sanitary district fhsd in february for the capping of two ccwc wells in order to facilitate fhsd s ability to secure certain permits 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  ccwc agreed to permanently remove from service and cap one of its wells  and cap another well which had never been used as a potable source of supply 
there was no similar gain in the same period of interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased million as compared to the same period in reflecting primarily the approval from the cpuc in for the recovery of previously incurred and expensed interest costs totaling million in the aerojet memorandum account  discussed previously 
in addition  the increase also reflects increases in long term debt interest expense of million primarily due to the placement of million of notes in october coupled with increases in short term bank loan interest rates 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in short term cash borrowings 
average bank loan balances outstanding under an awr credit facility for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to an average of million during the same period of interest income for the year ended december   interest income increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i interest of million accrued on the uncollected balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account authorized by the cpuc  ii interest income of  related to a million irs refund received in may  and iii interest earned on short term cash surplus 
these increases were partially offset by the recognition in july of approximately  in interest income earned on the million aerojet long term note receivable 
the recording of the interest income had been deferred pending the final cpuc decision on the aerojet matter 
registrant has since been recording the interest income on the million aerojet long term note receivable on a monthly basis 
other for the year ended december   registrant recorded other income of  as a result of its ownership interest in a non operating equity investment 
income tax expense for the year ended december   income tax expense decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due  in part  to a decrease in pretax income of 
in addition  the decrease was as a result of flow through adjustments and a refund claim  as discussed further  below 
the etr for the year ended december  decreased by approximately percentage points to as compared to a etr applicable to the year ended december  the variance between the etr and the statutory tax rate is primarily the result of differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
flow through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period  with an offsetting increase or decrease occurring in another period 
during the second quarter of  the recognition of the federal effect of state taxes was adjusted to conform to the flow through method reflected in the tax calculation for ratemaking purposes  which partially defers the recognition of the effect to the subsequent tax year 
this reduced income tax expense by  for the year ended december  during the third quarter of  awr filed an amended tax return for with the irs which was subject to irs and jct review 
during the second quarter of  the irs and jct reviews were completed and awr received a refund in the amount of its original claim of million  with interest 
consequently  in the second quarter of  awr recorded a tax benefit of  of which  was attributable to gswc 
the effect of the difference between the cash received and this tax benefit is reflected between the current and deferred tax provisions  which did not impact net tax expense 
the refund claim benefit contributed to of the percentage point etr reduction referred to  above 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are important to the portrayal of awr s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments of awr s management
