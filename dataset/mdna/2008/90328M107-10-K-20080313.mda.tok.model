item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
readers are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations that are expressed in forward looking statements within this report 
part i item business general usana health sciences  inc we  usana or the company is a utah corporation  founded in by myron w 
wentz  phd  that develops and manufactures high quality  science based nutritional and personal care products  with a commitment to continuous product innovation and sound scientific research 
we distribute and sell our products internationally through a network marketing system  which is a form of direct selling 
our international markets include canada  mexico  australia  new zealand  singapore  malaysia  hong kong  taiwan  japan  and south korea  and direct sales from the united states to the united kingdom and the netherlands 
our customer base comprises two types of customers  associates and preferred customers 
associates are independent distributors of our products  who also purchase our products for personal use 
preferred customers purchase our products strictly for their personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products 
as of december   we had  active associates and  active preferred customers worldwide 
for purposes of this report  we only count as active those associates and preferred customers who have purchased product from usana at any time during the most recent three month period 
our net sales in fiscal year were million  of which was generated by associates  and by preferred customers 
associates are encouraged to build and manage their own sales force by recruiting  managing  and training others to sell our products  and they are compensated on sales generated by their business group 
associates can also receive compensation by purchasing products at wholesale prices and selling them at retail prices 
we believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person to person product education  which is not readily available through traditional distribution channels 
this personal touch may enhance consumers awareness of the health benefits of our products  as well as motivate them to live and support a healthier lifestyle 
additionally  we feel that network marketing appeals to a broad cross section of people  particularly those seeking to supplement their income  start a home based business  or pursue entrepreneurial opportunities other than conventional full time employment 
we consider our high quality products  compact product lines  the rewarding usana associate compensation plan the compensation plan  distributor support and recognition  and weekly associate incentive payments to be attractive components of the usana network marketing system 
we sell products from two primary product lines usana nutritionals  which includes high quality supplements and functional foods  and sens beautiful science sens  a unique line of skin and personal care products 
we also offer sales and marketing tools that are designed to assist our associates in building their businesses and in selling our products  as well as combination packs  which include a variety of products from each product line 
in  the usana nutritionals and sens product lines represented approximately and  respectively  of our total product sales 
sales from other items  the majority of which include marketing and sales tools  accounted for the remaining of total product sales 
we limit our product lines to include only science based products that we believe can provide health benefits to a significant percentage of our customers 
additionally  while not required  our products are designed  manufactured  packaged  and labeled at levels that we believe are consistent with the more rigorous pharmaceutical standards 
from july through august  we also operated a third party contract manufacturing business at a facility located in draper  utah  which we historically disclosed as a separate reportable business segment 
we acquired the contract manufacturing business as part of a vertical integration strategy to manufacture and package our sens line of skin and beauty care products 
on august   we sold our third party contract manufacturing business in order to focus on our direct selling business 
we retained the assets that are associated with manufacturing and packaging our sens products 
we currently lease space from the draper facility  where we continue to manufacture and package our sens products 
as a result of the sale of the third party contract manufacturing business  we now consider our operations to be a single reportable segment direct selling 
products our primary product lines consist of usana nutritionals and sens 
the usana nutritionals product line is further categorized into three separate classifications essentials  optimizers  and macro optimizers 
usana nutritionals the essentials include core vitamin and mineral supplements that provide a foundation of advanced nutrition for every age group

usana essentials for adults consists of two products mega antioxidant  a balanced  high potency blend of vitamins  antioxidants  and other important nutrients to support cellular metabolism and to counteract free radical damage  and chelated mineral  a complete spectrum of essential minerals  in balanced  highly absorbable forms 
the usana essentials are also a part of the healthpak  a convenient pillow pack that also includes some key optimizers 
during the third quarter of  we introduced a new product concept for our customers called myhealthpak 
this concept offers a fully customizable packaging system for our supplement products that allows customers to create their own personalized selection of our full line of nutritional supplements in a pillow pack that is similar to our healthpak product 
optimizers are more targeted supplements that are designed to meet individual health and nutritional needs 
products in this category include proflavanol  poly c  procosa ii  coquinone  biomega  e prime  bodyrox active calcium chewable  active calcium  phytoestrin  palmetto plus  ginkgo ps  garlic ec  visionex  optomega  hepasil dtx  and tenx antioxidant blast 
the macro optimizers include healthy  low glycemic functional foods and other related products nutrimeal  fibergy  and soyamax drink mixes  as well as nutrition and fibergy bars 
our reset weight management program and the accompanying reset kit are also part of the macro optimizers 
the reset kit is conveniently packaged in a self contained box with all of the usana products that are needed to complete a five day regimen  which is designed to assist adults in losing weight and in beginning a positive  long term change in their diet 
sens beautiful science the sens product line includes premium  science based  personal care products that support healthy skin and hair by providing advanced topical nourishment  moisturization  and protection 
these products are manufactured with our patented self preserving technology  which uses a unique blend of botanicals  antioxidants  and active ingredients to keep products fresh  without adding traditional chemical preservatives 
products in this line include perfecting essence  gentle daily cleanser  hydrating toner  daytime protective emulsion  eye nourisher  night renewal  serum intensive  rice bran polisher  cr me masque  revitalizing shampoo  nourishing conditioner  firming body nourisher  energizing shower gel  and intensive hand therapy 
all other in addition to these principal product lines  we develop and sell materials and online tools that are designed to assist our associates in building their businesses and in marketing our products 
these resource materials and sales tools include product brochures and business forms that are designed by us and are printed by outside publishers 
in addition  we occasionally provide reprints of other commercial publications that feature usana and may be used as a sales tool 
we also periodically contract with authors and publishers to produce or provide books  tapes  and other items that deal with health topics and personal motivation  which we then sell to our associates 
new associates are required to purchase a starter kit  which contains usana training materials that help them to build their businesses 
associates do not earn commissions on the sale of starter kits or sales tools 
the following table summarizes the approximate percentages of total product sales that were contributed by our major product lines for the last three fiscal years year ended usana nutritionals essentials optimizers macro optimizers sens beautiful science all other the essentials category under the usana nutritionals includes usana essentials  healthpak  body rox  and usanimals 
key products the following table highlights sales data for our top selling products as a percentage of total product sales for the last three fiscal years 
year ended usana essentials healthpak proflavanol geographic presence our products are distributed and sold in countries throughout the world 
we have historically presented information for these countries in two geographic regions north america and asia pacific 
north america included the united states  canada  mexico  and direct sales to the united kingdom and the netherlands  and asia pacific included australia new zealand  hong kong  japan  taiwan  south korea  singapore  and malaysia 
as our international presence has continued to grow  we now present this information in four geographic regions north america united states  canada  mexico  and direct sales from the united states to the united kingdom and the netherlands southeast asia pacific australia new zealand  singapore  and malaysia we commenced operations in malaysia in january east asia hong kong and taiwan north asia japan and south korea currently  a significant portion of our net sales are concentrated in the north america region  which represented of net sales in the united states continues to be our largest market  representing of net sales during as we continue to expand internationally  our operating results will likely become more sensitive to economic and political conditions in foreign markets  as well as to foreign currency fluctuations 
net sales reported for each geographic region are determined by the location from which the product shipment originates and are reported for the last three fiscal years below 
additional financial information relating to our geographic regions can be found in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended region north america    southeast asia pacific    east asia    north asia    research and development we focus our research and development efforts on developing and providing the highest quality  science based products that reduce the risk of chronic degenerative disease and promote long term health 
our research and development activities include developing products that are new to usana and new to the industry  updating existing formulas to keep them current with the latest science  and adapting existing formulas to meet ever changing regulations in new and existing international markets 
our scientists are continually reviewing the latest published research on nutrition  attending scientific conferences  and working in collaboration with a number of outside research institutions and researchers to identify possible new products and opportunities to reformulate existing products 
in  we expanded our existing relationship with the linus pauling institute lpi at oregon state university in an effort to better determine the function and role of micronutrients such as vitamins  minerals  and antioxidants in promoting optimal health and preventing disease 
as part of this relationship  our in house research team will collaborate with lpi on nutritional and clinical research 
additionally  we plan to contribute  annually to lpi to help fund research on the role of nutrition in preventing oxidative stress  glycemic stress  and chronic inflammation  as well as the development of physiological markers of these conditions 
our goal is to maintain a sharp focus on nutrition both inside and outside the body in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases  and on healthy weight management 
because we believe in focusing on key health issues within our society rather than on fads  we do not introduce a new product unless we believe that it can provide health benefits to a significant percentage of our customers 
as a result  we maintain a focused and compact line of products  which we believe simplifies the selling and buying process for associates and preferred customers 
we follow pharmaceutical standards established by the us pharmacopeia in the development and reformulation of our products 
our ingredients are selected to meet a number of criteria  including  but not limited to safety  potency  purity  stability  bio availability  natural versus synthetic  and whether the ingredients are readily available 
we control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage  and we maintain our quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients  manufacturing  packaging  and labeling 
in fiscal years   and  we expended million  million  and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
we intend to continue dedicating resources at similar levels for the research and development of new products and the reformulation of existing products 
manufacturing and quality assurance tablet manufacturing tablet manufacturing is conducted at our salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility 
our tablet production process uses automatic and semi automatic equipment and includes the following identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials  acquiring raw materials  analyzing raw material quality  weighing or otherwise measuring raw materials  mixing raw materials into batches  forming mixtures into tablets  coating and sorting the tablets  analyzing tablet quality  packaging finished products  and analyzing finished product quality 
we conduct sample testing of raw materials  in process materials  and finished products for purity  potency  and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications  and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests 
our salt lake city manufacturing facility is registered with the us food and drug administration fda  health canada  the australian therapeutic goods administration tga  and other governmental agencies  as required 
this facility is audited regularly by various organizations and government agencies to assess  among other things  compliance with good manufacturing practice regulations gmps and with labeling claims 
based on these audits  our salt lake city manufacturing facility has received and maintains certifications from the islamic foods and nutrition counsel of america in compliance with halal  nsf international in compliance with product testing and gmp  and the tga in compliance with the therapeutic goods act of for the last several years  the manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the united states has required compliance with food model gmps 
on june   however  the fda published gmps for dietary supplements  which will become effective june  the dietary supplement gmps are based on the food model gmps  with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements 
we believe that our processes comply with the fda s more demanding drug model gmps and  therefore  do not anticipate making any significant changes to our current processes to comply with these stricter requirements 
personal care manufacturing in addition to tablet manufacturing  we manufacture our personal care products at the draper  utah manufacturing facility 
the production process for personal care products includes identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials  acquiring raw materials  analyzing raw material quality  weighing or otherwise measuring the raw materials  mixing raw materials into batches  analyzing liquid batch quality  packaging finished products  and analyzing finished product quality 
we conduct sample testing of raw materials  in process materials  and finished products for purity  potency  and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications  and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests 
at the draper facility  we have standard technology for producing batches of personal care items  and we have semi automatic packaging equipment for packaging the end product 
we employ qualified staff to develop  implement  and maintain a quality system 
although the fda has not promulgated gmp requirements for manufacturing personal care products  we voluntarily maintain compliance with the product development and gmp guidance of the cosmetic  toiletry and fragrance association 
third party suppliers and manufacturers we contract with third party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of some of our products 
these third party suppliers and manufacturers produce and  in most cases  package these products according to formulations that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in house product development team 
these products include gelatin capsuled supplements  garlic ec  optomega  certain powdered drink mixes  and nutrition bars 
quality control we conduct quality control processes in two in house laboratories that are located in salt lake city  utah 
in our microbiology laboratory  scientists test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods 
in our analytical chemistry laboratory  scientists test for chemical contamination and accurate levels of active ingredients in both raw materials and finished products 
both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine the shelf life of our products 
our laboratory staff also performs chemical assays on vitamin and mineral constituents  using united states pharmacopoeia methods and other internally validated methods 
in addition to our quality control and clinical laboratories  our headquarters facility also houses a laboratory designated for research and development 
most of the raw ingredients that are used in the manufacture of our products are available from a number of suppliers 
we have not generally experienced difficulty in obtaining necessary quantities of raw ingredients 
when supplies of certain raw materials have tightened  we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials  as needed  and believe we will be able to do so in the future  if the need arises 
our raw material suppliers must demonstrate stringent process and product quality control before we use their products in our manufacturing process 
distribution and marketing general we distribute our products internationally through a network marketing system  which is a form of person to person direct selling through a network of vertically organized independent distributors 
these distributors purchase products at wholesale prices from the manufacturer and then make retail sales to consumers 
the concept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends  neighbors  relatives  and close acquaintances 
we believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person to person product education  which is not as readily available through other distribution channels 
structure of network marketing program a person who wishes to sell usana products must join our independent sales force as an associate 
a person becomes an associate by completing an application under the sponsorship of an existing associate 
the new associate then becomes part of the sponsoring associate s downline sales organization 
new associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to the usana policies and procedures 
new associates are also required to purchase a starter kit that includes a detailed manual  including our policies and procedures 
we sell starter kits at our cost for a price of approximately us we also offer starter kits in an electronic format at a lower price  which we also sell at our cost 
subject to payment of a minimal annual renewal fee  associates may continue to distribute products until they voluntarily withdraw or are terminated for failing to adhere to our policies and procedures 
we also sell directly to customers who purchase products only for personal consumption 
this program is our preferred customer program 
preferred customers may not resell or distribute our products 
we believe this program gives us access to a market that would otherwise be missed  by targeting customers who enjoy usana products  but who prefer not to maintain a selling  distribution  or other business relationship with us 
although our policies prohibit preferred customers from engaging in retail sales of products  they may enroll as associates at any time  if they desire 
preferred customers are not eligible to earn commissions  nor to participate in our compensation plan 
associate training and motivation initial training of associates about the products  the compensation plan  network marketing  and about usana is provided primarily by an associate s sponsor and others in their sales organization 
we develop and sell training materials and sales tools to assist associates in building their businesses  as well as provide reprints from other commercial publications that feature usana and may be used as sales tools 
we also sponsor and conduct regional  national  and international associate events  as well as intensive leadership training seminars 
attendance at these sessions is voluntary  and we undertake no generalized effort to provide individualized training to associates  although experience shows that the most effective and successful associates participate in training activities 
associate compensation the compensation plan provides several opportunities for associates to earn compensation  provided they are willing to consistently work at building  training  and retaining their downline organizations to sell usana products to consumers 
we believe this compensation plan is distinctive for its weekly payouts  which are designed to create appropriate incentives for the sale of usana products 
associates cannot simply recruit others for the purpose of developing a downline and earn income passively  depending solely on the efforts of their downline 
the primary way in which an associate can earn compensation is by generating sales volume points through our base compensation plan 
sales volume points are assigned to each of our products and are generally targeted to represent a certain percent of the price in us dollars 
each associate is required to purchase a certain amount of product each month qualifying purchases  which they must either resell to consumers or use personally in order to qualifiy to earn commissions or bonuses under usana s compensation plan 
associates do not earn commissions on these qualifying purchases 
the purpose of our compensation plan is to reward associates for actively selling our products and for recruiting and retaining others to sell our products 
associates can earn compensation in four ways generating sales volume points  which are based on product sales of their downline sales organization  participating in a leadership bonus pool  which is based on certain performance requirements  purchasing products at wholesale prices from usana and selling them to consumers at higher retail prices  and earning prizes or bonuses through company sponsored promotions and contests 
most associates sell our products on a part time basis and consume them personally 
the sponsoring of new associates results in the creation of multiple levels within our network marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as the downline of the sponsoring associate 
downline associates may also sponsor new associates  creating additional levels in their network  but also forming a part of the same downline as the original sponsoring associate 
associates who are interested in earning additional income and who successfully expand their business network or downline can qualify for higher levels of compensation  as well as leadership bonuses  by attaining certain sales volume levels and by demonstrating leadership abilities 
we do not pay commissions based on recruiting or sponsorship activity 
associates may not sell competitive products to other usana associates or solicit usana associates to participate in other network marketing opportunities 
our policies and procedures also restrict associates advertising and representations or claims concerning usana products or our compensation plan 
we endeavor to seamlessly integrate this compensation plan across all markets in which usana products are sold  allowing associates to receive commissions for global not merely local product sales 
this seamless downline structure is designed to allow an associate to build a global network by establishing downlines in any of the markets where we operate 
associates may expand their downline organizations into new markets without establishing new downlines or requalifying for higher levels of compensation in the newly opened markets 
we believe this seamless compensation plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally  and we intend  where permitted  to continue to integrate new markets into our compensation plan 
industry overview as both a manufacturer and a direct seller of nutritional and personal care products  we compete within two industries nutrition and direct selling 
the nutrition industry includes many small and medium sized companies that manufacture and distribute products that are generally intended to maintain the body s health and general well being  including the following nutritional supplements products such as vitamins and minerals  specialty supplements  herbs and botanicals  meal replacements  dietary supplements  and derivative compounds  natural and organic foods products such as cereals  milk  non dairy beverages  and frozen entrees  functional foods products with added ingredients or fortification that are designed specifically for health or performance purposes  and natural personal care products combining nutrition with skin care 
we believe that the following factors drive growth in the nutrition industry the general public s heightened awareness and understanding of the connection between diet and health  the aging population in most of our markets  particularly the baby boomer generation in the us  who tend to use more nutritional supplementation as they age  rising health care costs and the worldwide trend toward preventative health care  and product introductions in response to new scientific findings 
nutritional products are distributed through six major sales channels 
each channel has changed in recent years  primarily due to advances in technology and communications that have resulted in improved product distribution and faster dissemination of information 
the major sales channels are as follows mass market retailers  including mass merchandisers  drug stores  supermarkets  and discount stores  natural health food retailers  network marketing  mail order  healthcare professionals and practitioners  and the internet 
we distribute our products through a network marketing system  which is a common form of direct selling 
according to the world federation of direct selling associations wfdsa  the direct selling industry currently generates approximately billion annually in worldwide retail sales  through approximately million independent distributors 
according to statistics compiled by the direct selling association the us member of the wfdsa  the united states remains the largest market for direct selling  with billion in annual retail sales and million independent distributors in according to the direct selling association  wellness products  which include nutritional supplements and functional foods  accounted for of the us direct retail sales in  and personal care products accounted for of such sales 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on growth trends in direct sales  as both a developer and manufacturer of nutritional supplements and personal care products 
operating strengths our principal objective is to be a leading developer and manufacturer of science based nutritional and personal care products and to create a rewarding opportunity through network marketing for our associates to distribute our products 
our strategy is to capitalize on our operating strengths  which include a strong research and development program  in house manufacturing capability  science based products  an attractive associate compensation plan with strong support  a scalable business model  and an experienced management team 
emphasis on research and development 
we have a technical team of approximately individuals who contribute to our research and development activities 
this team includes experienced scientists  including several scientists holding phd degrees  quality engineers  and regulatory specialists 
in our research and development laboratories  our scientists and researchers investigate in vitro and in vivo activity of new natural extracts and formulated products  identify and research combinations of nutrients that may be candidates for new products  develop new nutritional ingredients for use in supplements  study the metabolic activity of existing and newly identified nutritional ingredients  enhance existing products  as new discoveries in nutrition and skin care are made  and formulate products to meet the regulatory requirements in all of our markets 
our scientists and researchers also perform double blind  placebo controlled  clinical studies which are intended to further evaluate the efficacy of our products 
we also collaborate with outside research organizations to further support various aspects of our research and development efforts 
for example  in we expanded our existing relationship with lpi at oregon state university 
additionally  we fund clinical research programs at boston university and the university of colorado 
it is through our research and development efforts and our partnerships with outside research organizations that we can provide what we believe to be some of the highest quality health products in the industry 
in house manufacturing 
we manufacture products that account for approximately of product sales 
we believe that our ability to manufacture our own products is a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons we can better control the quality of raw materials and the purity and potency of finished products  we can more reliably monitor the manufacturing process to reduce the risk of product contamination  we can better control production schedules to increase the likelihood of maintaining an uninterrupted supply of products for our customers  we are able to produce most of our own prototypes in the research phase of product development  and we believe we can better manage the underlying costs associated with manufacturing our products 
science based products 
as a result of our emphasis on research and development and our in house manufacturing capabilities we have developed a focused and compact line of high quality health products that we believe provide health benefits to a significant percentage of our customers 
our products have been developed based on a combination of published research  in vitro and in vivo testing  in house and third party clinical studies  and sponsored research 
additionally  we design  manufacture  package  and label our products in a manner that we believe is consistent with pharmaceutical standards 
attractive associate compensation plan and support 
we are committed to providing a highly competitive compensation plan to attract and retain associates who constitute our sales force 
we believe that our compensation plan is one of the most financially rewarding in the network marketing industry 
associate incentives totaled million  or of net sales in we pay associate incentives weekly and our compensation plan is a global seamless plan  meaning that associates can be compensated each week for their business success in any market in which we conduct business 
to support our associates  we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year  which offer information about our products and our network marketing system 
these meetings are designed to assist associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with successful associates and with the usana management team 
we also provide low cost sales tools  which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home based business for our associates 
in addition to company sponsored meetings and sales tools  we maintain a website exclusively for our associates  where they can keep up on the latest usana news  obtain training material  manage their personal information  enroll new customers  shop for products  and register for company sponsored events 
additionally  through this website  associates can access other online services 
for example  we offer an online business management service  which includes a tool that helps associates track and manage their business activity  a personal webpage to which prospects or retail customers can be directed  e cards for advertising  and a tax management tool 
business model 
we believe our business model provides  among others  the following advantages our business model does not require a company employed sales force to sell our products  and we experience a minimal incremental cost to add a new associate  commissions paid to our associates are tied to sales performance  because payment is required at the time an associate or preferred customer purchases product  we have virtually no accounts receivable  we have a monthly product subscription program known as autoship  which provides a stream of recurring revenue  for the year ended december   this program represented of our net sales  and we can readily expand into new international markets with only moderate investment  because we generally maintain only one administrative and customer support office and one or two warehouses in each of these markets 
experienced management team 
our management team includes individuals with expertise in various scientific and managerial disciplines  including nutrition  product research and development  international development  marketing  customer network development  information technology  finance  and operations 
the current executive management team has been in place for several years and is responsible for supporting growth  research and development  international expansion  strengthening our financial condition  and improving our internal controls 
growth strategy we seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies attract and retain associates and preferred customers 
we recognize the need to continue to attract and retain associates 
we maintain emphasis on the partnership between the usana management team and our associate leaders 
through this partnership  our associate leaders continue to host health freedom meetings and online presentations  both aimed at presenting the business opportunity to potential associates and providing additional training and resources for existing associates 
in addition to our annual international convention and our asia pacific convention  we hold several regional events in key growth areas to provide support and training to new associates in these areas 
we intend to continue growing our business by maintaining a focus on our two core values  true health and true wealth 
we plan to accomplish this by increasing the number of active associates and teaching them how to build a strong customer base 
by leveraging the growth we have in our associate field  we believe we can continue to attract individuals that are interested in joining a winning team and starting a home based business with usana 
we will continue to make it easier for our customers to order product from usana and to learn about the many products that we offer 
this will be accomplished with an improved online shopping cart and website  a product catalog dedicated to preferred customers  product sampling  and target marketing 
we are also working on a preferred customer referral system  which will include awards and incentives for bringing in new customers 
we believe we offer the finest web based business tools in the industry 
we will continue to make improvements and enhancements to these tools  which offer a convenient and simple way for our associates to manage their business and be more productive 
enter new markets 
we believe that significant growth opportunities continue to exist in markets where we currently conduct business and in new international markets 
new markets are selected following an assessment of several factors  including market size  anticipated demand for usana products  receptiveness to network marketing  and the market entry process  which includes consideration of possible regulatory restrictions on our products or our network marketing system 
we have begun to register certain products with regulatory and government agencies in preparation for further international expansion 
wherever possible  we expect to seamlessly integrate the compensation plan in each market to allow associates to receive commissions for global not merely local product sales 
the seamless downline structure is designed to allow an associate to build a global network by creating downlines across national borders 
associates are not required to establish new downlines or to re qualify for higher levels of compensation in newly opened markets 
we believe this seamless compensation plan can significantly enhance our ability to expand internationally  and we intend  where permitted  to integrate future markets into this plan 
introduce new and re formulate existing products 
our research and development team is continually researching the latest scientific findings related to nutrition  looking at new technology and attending scientific conferences 
if  in the process  we see potential for a new product that provides a true health benefit addressing a particular health issue  and if we believe its benefits can be realized by a significant percentage of our customers  we will generally pursue development of that product 
at our international convention in august   we introduced a new product and technology  called myhealthpak 
this technology allows customers to create their own personalized selection of our line of nutritional supplements in daily am and pm pillow packs 
if in the process of our research activities mentioned above  our research and development team identifies a new or existing ingredient that could possibly be used to enhance one of our existing products  we will generally pursue a product upgrade 
our intention is to ensure that all of our products  new and existing  incorporate the latest science in nutrition 
we typically upgrade at least one of our products each year 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities may arise in the future 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that would grow our customer base  expand our product lines  enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise  allow vertical integration  or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals 
capital investment 
during and continuing in  we have significantly added to our capital and human resources in order to support the growth of our business 
in salt lake city  we have largely completed an expansion and upgrade of our corporate campus 
in addition to the expansion of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities  in we purchased a facility in sydney  australia and are working on the remodel and fit out of this facility  to where our australian operations will be moved 
we also added to our human resources during  increasing bench strength in key functions at our corporate and regional offices 
another significant investment during was the addition of a new automated packaging system  which should be fully functioning by the second quarter of product returns product returns have not been a material factor in our business  totaling approximately of net sales during each of the fiscal years and  and of net sales during fiscal year because our emphasis on satisfaction is a hallmark of our business model  we permit associates to return any unused product from their first purchase within the first days following their purchase for a refund of the sales price 
thereafter  any returned product that is unused and resalable is refunded up to one year from the date of purchase at of the sales price less a restocking fee 
according to the terms of the associate agreement  return of product that was not damaged at the time of receipt by the associate  where the purchase amount exceeds  may result in cancellation of the associate s distributorship 
depending upon the conditions under which product was returned  associates and preferred customers may receive their refunded amount either based on their original form of payment or with product or credit on account 
major customers sales are made to independent associates and preferred customers 
no single customer accounted for or more of net sales in any of the last three fiscal years 
associates may sell products only in countries where we have approved the sale of our products 
compliance by associates from time to time some associates will fail to adhere to the usana policies and procedures  including those governing the marketing of our products or the permissible representations regarding the compensation plan 
we systematically review reports of alleged associate misbehavior 
infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to a compliance committee that determines what disciplinary action may be warranted in each case 
if we determine that an associate has violated any of the usana policies and procedures  we may take a number of disciplinary actions 
for example  we may impose sanctions  such as warnings  fines or probation 
we also may withdraw or deny awards  suspend privileges  withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied  or take other appropriate actions in our discretion 
more serious infractions may result in termination of the associate s purchase and distribution rights completely 
information technology we believe that the ability to efficiently manage distribution  compensation  manufacturing  inventory control  and communications functions through the use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success 
our information technology resources are maintained primarily by our in house staff to optimally support our customer base and core business processes 
this staff manages an array of systems and processes which support our global operations hours a day and days a year 
three of our critical applications include the following a web based application that provides online services to associates  such as training sessions and presentations  online shopping  enrollment  company and product information  and other tools to help associates effectively manage their downline organizations 
our web applications are supported by a clustered environment and a redundant system outside of our home office  which serves as a disaster recovery site 
a web enabled order entry system that handles order entry  customer information  compensation  the hierarchy of associates  returns  invoices  and other transactional based processes 
a fully integrated worldwide enterprise resource planning erp system that handles accounting  inventory management  production processes  quality assurance  and reporting requirements in a multinational environment 
this erp system supports global data integrity and multinational corporate governance and compliance 
regulatory matters product regulation 
numerous governmental agencies in the united states and other countries regulate the manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  promoting  distributing  and the selling of nutrition  health  beauty  and weight management products 
in the united states  advertisement of our products is regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the ftc act and  where such advertising is considered to be product labeling by the fda  under the food  drug  and cosmetic act fd c and the regulations thereunder 
usana products are also subject to regulation by  among others  the consumer product safety commission  the us department of agriculture  and the environmental protection agency 
the manufacturing  labeling  and advertising of products are also regulated by various governmental agencies in each foreign country in which they are distributed 
for example  in australia  we are subject to the therapeutic goods administration and  in japan  to the ministry of health  labor and welfare 
our largest selling product group includes products that are regulated as dietary supplements under the fd c 
dietary supplements are also regulated in the united states under the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea 
we believe that the dshea provides a favorable regulatory climate to the dietary supplement industry 
some of our powdered drink  food bar  and other nutrition products are regulated as foods under the nutrition labeling and education act of nlea 
the nlea establishes requirements for ingredient and nutritional labeling including labeling claims 
although we believe our product claims comply with the law  we may need to revise some product labeling at a future date  if these labeling requirements change 
under these regulations  a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient defined as an ingredient not on the market before october  must have a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe 
the manufacturer must notify the fda at least days before marketing products containing new dietary ingredients and must provide the fda with the information upon which the manufacturer has based its conclusion that the product has a reasonable expectation of safety 
for the last several years  the manufacture of dietary supplements and related products in the united states has required compliance with food model gmps 
however  on june   the fda published gmps for dietary supplements  which will be effective june  the dietary supplement gmps are based on the food model gmps  with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements 
we believe that our processes comply with the fda s more demanding drug model gmps and  therefore  do not anticipate making any significant changes to our current processes to comply with these more strict requirements 
in general  our personal care products  which are regulated as cosmetic products by the fda  are not subject to pre market approval by that agency 
cosmetics  however  are subject to regulation by the fda under the fd c adulteration and misbranding provisions 
cosmetics also are subject to specific labeling regulations  including warning statements  if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately substantiated or if the product may be hazardous  as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under the fair packaging and labeling act 
cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug ie  that are intended to treat or prevent disease or affect the structure or function of the body  such as sunscreens  are regulated as drugs 
otc drug products may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of the otc monograph that is applicable to that drug 
drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved new drug application nda before marketing may begin 
under these provisions  if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our otc drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our otc drug products  we will have to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved nda or until the time  if ever  that the monograph is amended to include such product 
if such an agency ruling were to become final  we would be required to stop marketing the product as currently formulated 
whether or not an otc drug product conforms to a monograph or is subject to an approved nda  the drug must comply with other requirements under the fdca  including gmp s  labeling  and the fdca s regulations regarding misbranding and adulteration 
advertising of products is subject to regulation by the ftc under the ftc act 
section of the ftc act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce 
section of the ftc act provides that disseminating any false advertisement pertaining to drugs or foods  which includes dietary supplements  is an unfair or deceptive act or practice 
under the ftc s substantiation doctrine  an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made 
failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices 
pursuant to this ftc requirement  we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products 
in recent years  the ftc has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplement  weight management  and cosmetic products 
the ftc has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement 
we believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products  and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines 
the ftc may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways  both administratively and judicially  using compulsory process  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement can result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  corrective advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
we have not been notified that we were the subject of any action by the ftc  but any action in the future by the ftc could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of bioterrorism act includes several provisions that have resulted in additional regulatory compliance issues for us 
for example  one provision in the bioterrorism act requires the secretary of health and human services to develop regulations that mandate that domestic and foreign facilities  which manufacture  process  pack  or hold food for human or animal consumption in the united states  register with the fda 
on november   we fulfilled this requirement by registering with the fda 
another provision of the bioterrorism act mandates that the fda receive prior notification of all food importation 
our tenx antioxidant blast is purchased from a manufacturer located in canada  and therefore  we are required to comply with this notification requirement upon importation of this product 
although some of our raw materials and other certain manufactured product may originate outside of the united states  we procure these items from entities in the united states 
from time to time  we may bring consumable products that we have sent from our salt lake facility to our international locations back into the united states from one or more of these locations 
when bringing these products back into the united states from any international location  we are also required to comply with this notification requirement 
on december   president bush signed the dietary supplement nonprescription drug consumer protection act into law 
the legislation requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over the counter products to notify the fda when they receive reports of serious adverse events 
usana already has an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years 
based on our understanding of the new law s requirements  we made some changes to our existing reporting system  and believe that we now comply with these new regulations 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of usana products for the market or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with local product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
foreign regulatory requirements have not placed a significant burden on our ability to operate in current foreign countries 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
network marketing regulation 
laws and regulations in each country in which we operate prevent the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling and network marketing activities 
these laws include anti pyramiding  securities  lottery  referral selling  anti fraud and business opportunity statutes  regulations  and court cases 
illegal schemes  typically referred to as pyramid  chain distribution  or endless chain schemes  compensate participants primarily or solely for the introduction or enrollment of additional participants into the scheme 
often these schemes are characterized by large up front entry or sign up fees  over priced products of low value  little or no emphasis on the sale or use of products  high pressure recruiting tactics  and claims of huge and quick financial rewards requiring little or no effort 
generally these laws are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within sales organizations is based on sales of the enterprise s products  rather than on investments in the organizations or on other criteria or activity that are not related to retail sales 
where required by law  we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing system  or  where approval is not required or available  the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance 
in addition to federal regulation in the united states  each state has enacted its own little ftc act to regulate sales and advertising 
occasionally  we receive requests to supply information regarding our network marketing plan to regulatory agencies 
although we have  from time to time  modified our network marketing system to comply with interpretations of various regulatory authorities  we believe that our network marketing program is in compliance with the laws and regulations relating to network marketing activities in our current markets 
nevertheless  we remain subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  the marketing system or the conduct of certain associates could be found not to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
failure by an associate or by us to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect the way we do business and could affect our ability to attract potential associates or enter into new markets 
in the united states  the ftc has been active in its enforcement efforts against both pyramid schemes and legitimate network marketing organizations with certain legally problematic components  having instituted several enforcement actions resulting in signed settlement agreements and the payment of large fines 
although  to our knowledge  we have not been the target of an ftc investigation  there can be no assurance that the ftc will not investigate us in the future 
on april   the ftc released a proposed new business opportunity rule 
this proposed rule would require pre sale disclosures for all business opportunities  which might include network marketing compensation plans 
the new business opportunity rule is currently only a proposed rule 
if implemented at all  the rule ultimately may not be implemented in a form that applies to network marketing compensation plans  or it may change significantly before it is implemented 
if this proposed rule were adopted as it is currently proposed  it would require us to change some of our current practices regarding pre sale disclosures 
we cannot predict the nature of any future law  regulation  interpretation  or application  nor can we predict what effect additional governmental legislation or regulations  judicial decisions  or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
it is possible that future legal requirements may require that we revise our network marketing program 
such new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
transfer pricing regulation 
we have adopted transfer prices  which are supported by a formal transfer pricing study for the sale of products to our subsidiaries in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws 
in addition  agreements between our subsidiaries and us have been entered into for services and contractual obligations  such as the payment of associate incentives that are also supported by the same formal transfer pricing study 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our standard transfer pricing practices for products  we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings may be adversely affected 
the tax treaties between the united states and most foreign countries provide for competent authority relief to avoid any double taxation 
we believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing regulations or that those laws will not be modified  which may require that we change our operating procedures 
competition we compete with other network marketing companies for distributors 
we also compete with manufacturers  distributors  and retailers of nutritional products for consumers 
on both fronts  some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial resources and better name recognition than we do 
we compete with these entities by emphasizing the underlying science  value  and superior quality of our products  simplicity in our product offerings  and the convenience and financial benefits afforded by our network marketing system and global seamless compensation plan 
our business is driven primarily by our distributors  whom we refer to as associates 
our ability to compete with other network marketing companies depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in network marketing is limited in each market and is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe that we offer an attractive opportunity for our associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
we believe that the leading network marketing company in the world  based on total sales  is amway corporation and its affiliates  and that avon products  inc is the leading direct seller of beauty and related products worldwide 
leading competitors in the nutritional network marketing and nutritional product industry include herbalife ltd  inc  market america  inc  nu skin enterprises  inc  nbty  inc  mannatech  and schiff nutrition international  inc 
based on information that is publicly available  net sales of the aforementioned companies range from million to billion 
we believe there are other manufacturers of competing product lines that may launch direct selling enterprises  which will compete with us in certain product lines and in the recruiting of associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully meet the challenges posed by this increased competition 
intellectual property trademarks 
we have developed and we use registered trademarks in our business  particularly relating to our corporate and product names 
we own trademarks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the united states  regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs 
we have filed applications and own trademark registrations  and we intend to register additional trademarks in foreign countries where usana products are or may be sold in the future 
protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection in the united states 
we also claim ownership and protection of certain product names  unregistered trademarks  and service marks under common law 
common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark 
in addition  common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used 
we believe these trademarks  whether registered or claimed under common law  constitute valuable assets  adding to recognition of usana and the effective marketing of usana products 
we therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete 
trade secrets 
we own certain intellectual property  including trade secrets  that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties  although some employees who are involved in research and development activities have not entered into these agreements 
even where these agreements exist  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets  but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws 
patents 
we have three us patents 
two of our patents relate to the method of extracting an antioxidant from olives and the byproducts of olive oil production 
these patents were issued in and will continue in force for years from the date of issue 
in  we entered into a licensing agreement with a supplier to make olive extract using our patented process 
our third patent relates to a method of self preserving our sens line of products 
this patent was issued in may and will continue in force for approximately years from the date of issue 
currently  it is very difficult to determine the exact future benefit of these patents 
we believe  however  that these patents have the potential to generate additional revenue in the future through new product development and royalties from licensing 
we intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action 
consequently  we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights 
any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel 
seasonality the third quarter is seasonally our softest quarter of each year 
in north america  which represents about two thirds of our consolidated net sales  associate activity tends to slow down as a result of the summer vacation season 
additionally  we hold our international convention during the third quarter each year  when we typically announce new products 
because our associates anticipate these new products  they tend to order fewer products in the months preceding this convention 
backlog our products are typically shipped within hours after receipt of an order 
as of march  we had no significant backlog of orders 
working capital practices we maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock in order to provide a high level of service to our associates and preferred customers 
substantial inventories are required to meet the needs of our dual role as manufacturer and distributor 
we also watch seasonal commodity markets and may buy ahead of normal demand to hedge against cost and supply risks 
environment we are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal  state  or local laws relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations 
employees as of march   we had employees worldwide  as measured by full time equivalency 
our employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have not experienced work stoppages as a result of labor disputes 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees

item a 
risk factors forward looking statements and certain risks the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the exchange act 
these statements relate to our expectations  hopes  beliefs  commitments  intentions  and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases  such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regarding our financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future  and the sufficiency of our existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward looking statements or for the reasons discussed below 
the fact that some of these risk factors may be the same or similar to those that we have filed with the securities and exchange commission in past reports means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks that are described here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and will likely be present in all periods 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
the forward looking statements in this report are made as of the date of this report  and we assume no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why our actual results could differ from those that we have projected in these forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations include the following as a network marketing company  we are dependent upon an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products 
we rely on non employee  independent associates to market and sell our products 
associates are independent contractors who purchase products directly for their own use or for resale 
associates typically work at the distribution of the products on a part time basis and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with us 
we have a large number of associates and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support to our associates 
we undertake minimal effort to provide individual training to associates 
our net sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of these non employee  independent associates 
our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new associates  retaining our existing associates  and in improving the productivity of our associates 
we can provide no assurances that the number of associates will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase 
we experienced a increase in active associates during and  and a increase during the number of active associates may not increase and could decline in the future 
associates may terminate their services at any time  and  like most direct selling companies  we experience a high turnover among new associates from year to year 
we cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of associates because we primarily rely upon existing associates to sponsor and train new associates and to motivate new and existing associates 
operating results could be adversely affected if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient economic incentive or interest to retain existing associates and to attract new associates 
the loss of a significant associate or downline sales organization could adversely affect our business 
we rely on the successful efforts of our associates that become leaders within our compensation plan 
our compensation plan is designed to permit associates to sponsor new associates  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the downline organization 
sponsored associates are referred to as downline associates within the sponsoring associate s downline network 
if these downline associates in turn sponsor new associates  additional business centers are created  with the new downline associates becoming part of the original sponsor s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  associates develop business relationships with other associates 
the loss of a key associate or group of associates  large turnovers or decreases in the size of the associate force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction  the costs associated with training new associates  and other related expenses may adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
moreover  our ability to continue to attract and retain associates can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general business and economic conditions  public perceptions about network marketing programs  high visibility investigations or legal proceeding against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care  or weight management products generally  other competing network marketing organizations entering into the marketplace that may recruit our existing associates or reduce the potential pool of new associates  and changes to the compensation plan required by law or implemented for business reasons that make attracting and retaining associates more difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain associates in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain our present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the violation of marketing or advertising laws by associates in connection with the sale of our products or the promotion of our compensation plan could adversely affect our business 
new associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to the usana policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit associates from making false  misleading and other improper claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products  associates may  from time to time  without our knowledge and in violation of our policies  create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims  or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
these violations may result in legal action against us by regulatory agencies  state attorneys general  or private parties 
legal actions against our associates or others who are associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business  including our network marketing system 
we take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor the activities of our associates to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by associates and to assure that the terms of our policies and procedures and compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
adverse publicity resulting from such activities could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain associates and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation  which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to sell some of our products in certain markets 
network marketing systems  such as ours  are frequently subject to laws and regulations that are directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition  and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than on investment in the sponsoring company 
regulatory authorities  in one or more of our present or future markets  could determine that our network marketing system does not comply with these laws and regulations or that it is prohibited 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
further  we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries  or we may be forced to alter our compensation plan 
we are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change  which could require us to change or modify the way we conduct our business in certain markets 
this could be particularly detrimental to us if we had to change or modify the way we conduct business in markets that represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
for example  the united states federal trade commission released a proposed new business opportunity rule on april  the proposed rule would require pre sale disclosures for all business opportunities  which might include network marketing compensation plans 
the new business opportunity rule is currently only a proposed rule 
if implemented at all  the rule ultimately may not be implemented in a form that applies to network marketing compensation plans  or it may change significantly before it is implemented 
if the proposed rule were adopted as it is currently proposed  it would require usana to change its current practices regarding pre sale disclosures 
we may have or incur obligations relating to the activities of our distributors 
our distributors are subject to taxation  and  in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as sales taxes or value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate records of such transactions 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security and similar taxes with respect to our distributors 
in the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent distributors as employees  or if our distributors are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors  under existing laws and interpretations  we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees  including social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
our ability to attract and retain associates and to sustain and enhance sales through our associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry  our competition  or our business generally 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations  regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies 
in  we were the victim of false statements made to the press and regulatory agencies  causing us to incur significant expense in defending and dispelling the allegations 
this adverse publicity also adversely impacted the market price of our stock and caused some insecurity among our associates 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our founder  dr 
myron wentz  is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our business  and our message is based in large part on his vision and reputation  which helps distinguish us from our competitors 
any loss or limitation on dr 
wentz as a lead spokesman for our mission  business  and products could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
in addition  our executive officers  including executive vice presidents  are primarily responsible for our day to day operations  and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers  to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels  and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team 
we cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers  nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our executive officers 
the loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives dr 
wentz effective control and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues 
gull holdings  ltd  an entity that is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owned of our outstanding common stock at december  by virtue of this stock ownership  dr 
wentz is able to exert significant influence over the election of the members of our board of directors and our business affairs 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  dr 
wentz also currently serves as chairman of our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to this directorship or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to other shareholders of the company 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation  which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution  and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries  including the us food and drug administration fda and the us federal trade commission ftc 
for example  failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by the fda could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
with respect to ftc matters  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  or such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action against us by the ftc could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
the fda published the final good manufacturing practice gmp regulations for dietary supplements in the federal register on june  the final rule goes into effect one year from the publication date  or june   for usana 
until the rule goes into effect  we must continue to adhere to current good manufacturing practices for food 
although not required to do so  we believe that we have always voluntarily manufactured and continue to manufacture our dietary supplement products in accordance with the standards of the fda s pharmaceutical model gmps  and we do not anticipate making any significant changes to our manufacturing practices to comply with these new regulations 
nevertheless  manufacturing dietary supplements is a complex process  and there is no assurance that we will be able to manufacture our existing or future products in compliance with these gmps 
on december   president bush signed the dietary supplement nonprescription drug consumer protection act into law 
this legislation came into effect in december and requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over the counter products to notify the fda when they receive reports of serious adverse events involving consumers of their products 
potential fda responses to any such report could include injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  or criminal prosecutions 
usana has an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years 
based on our current understanding of this legislation and fda guidance  we do not anticipate the need to make any significant changes to our existing reporting system 
nevertheless  any action by the fda in response to a serious adverse event report that may be filed by us could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or a comparable agency 
for example  our manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and health canada and is certified by australia s therapeutic goods administration 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies of the countries in which our products are sold 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  could have on our business 
these potential effects could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and reporting requirements  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  or additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our net sales are significantly affected by our success in growing existing markets  as well as opening new markets 
as we continue to expand into international markets  our business becomes increasingly subject to political  economic  legal and other risks 
changes in these markets could adversely affect our business 
we have a history of expanding into new international markets 
we commenced operations in australia  new zealand  and the united kingdom in and in hong kong in in  we began limited business activity in japan  where we launched more formal operations in in  we began business operations in taiwan 
we commenced operations in south korea and singapore in and opened operations in mexico in in we began business operations in malaysia 
we believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis  or that new markets will be profitable 
we must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  before marketing commences it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted will be or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
we may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country 
once we have entered a market  we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or to attract local customers 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals in new markets or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  other network marketing companies already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local associate population to a new opportunity  such as usana  or to make it more difficult for us to recruit qualified associates 
even if we are able to commence operations in foreign countries  there may not be a sufficient population of persons who are interested in our network marketing system 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our compensation plan across all markets in which our products are sold 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
on december   china announced the adoption of new regulations governing direct selling 
single level compensation models are permissible under these new regulations  but multi level compensation models  as practiced by usana and many other direct selling companies  are not 
if we were to enter the chinese market  we would be required to adjust our compensation and selling model to comply with these regulations 
these adjustments could require more time and effort to enter the chinese market than would otherwise be necessary  if multi level compensation models were permissible 
additionally  such adjustments could make it more difficult to be successful there 
an increase in the amount of incentives paid to associates would reduce profitability 
the payment of associate incentives is our most significant expense 
these incentives include commissions  leadership bonuses  and certain awards and prizes 
from time to time  we have changed our compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales 
management closely monitors the amount of associate incentives that are paid as a percentage of net sales  and they may periodically adjust our compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings 
there can be no assurance that changes to the compensation plan or product pricing will be successful in maintaining current levels of associate incentives as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  such changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated associates 
an increase in incentive payments to associates as a percentage of net sales would reduce our profitability 
associate incentives as a percent of sales in   and were   and  respectively 
we are subject to risks associated with our reliance upon information technology systems 
our success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability  and proper use of information processing systems and management information technology 
our information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain associate and preferred customer records  accurately track purchases and incentive payments  manage accounting  finance and manufacturing operations  generate reports  and provide customer service and technical support 
although off site data back up is maintained  it is possible that an interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier  and more established competitors 
we face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  and other nutritional products  as described in greater detail in business competition 
numerous manufacturers  associates  and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition and personal care products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution  including retail stores 
our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small  compared to the wide variety of products offered by many of our competitors 
we are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention  and commitment of new and existing associates 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals who may be interested in network marketing is limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
taxation and transfer pricing considerations affect our operations 
in many countries  including the united states  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations that are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported by our us and foreign entities and are taxed appropriately 
although we believe that we are in compliance with all material regulations and restrictions in this regard  we are subject to the risk that taxing authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed 
we are also subject to the risk that taxing authorities in any of our markets could change the laws in a manner that may increase our effective tax rate and or duties on our products 
under tax treaties  we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for foreign taxes actually paid abroad 
in the event any audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us  we may or may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits 
currently  we are utilizing all foreign tax credits in the year in which they arise 
because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment  we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future 
as a result  adverse outcomes in these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
exchange rate fluctuations affect our foreign operations and our net sales and earnings 
over the past several years  a significant portion of our net sales have been generated outside the united states 
such sales for the year ended december  represented of our total net sales 
we will likely continue to expand our foreign operations  exposing us to expanding risks of changes in social  political  and economic conditions in foreign countries  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment or foreign exchange 
because a significant portion of our sales is in foreign countries  exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for us to establish or to continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell similar products in the same market 
as our business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and operating costs will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that our non us financial results be converted to non us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases by our foreign subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as operations expand in countries where foreign currency transactions may be made  our operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact that these changes might have on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect our sales to customers outside the united states 
from time to time we enter into forward and option foreign exchange contracts to manage currency fluctuations on certain commitments that are denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency contract transactions will protect our operating results or cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
those adverse effects would also adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
disruptions to shipping channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets 
in  the financial press reported congestion at west coast ports caused by increasing cargo volumes  a lack of capacity on the railroads  and a shortage of manpower 
we felt the effects in our container shipments to australia  which required additional use of airfreight to meet demand 
port congestion has since been relieved 
although subsequently there has been no significant port congestion  we continue to watch for signs of upcoming congestion 
congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies  resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs 
the inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices  or at all  or the inability to obtain certain products from third party suppliers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials 
we acquire all of our raw materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased through purchase order  often invoking pre negotiated annual supply agreements 
we have very few long term agreements for the supply of these materials 
we also contract with third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products  including gelatin capsuled supplements  garlic ec  optomega  certain powdered drink mixes  and nutrition bars 
these third party suppliers and manufacturers produce and  in most cases  package these products according to formulations that have been developed by or in conjunction with our in house product development team 
there is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue manufacturing our products or selling their products to us 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages or back orders for products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
in certain situations  we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source 
we have  in the past  discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products that were manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials or manufactured products that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to pay 
because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials and products  we are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials  based on conditions not within our control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
shortages of raw materials may temporarily adversely affect our margins or our profitability related to the sale of those products 
in  the demand for coenzyme q in the nutrition industry began to increase dramatically  which subsequently caused a shortage in supply of this raw material component 
as a result  suppliers began re tooling their manufacturing facilities to increase production capacity in order to meet the growing demand 
certain of our nutritional products were affected by this raw material shortage 
although we identified multiple sources to supply quality raw ingredients  quantities of materials acquired during this shortage were purchased at higher prices  which negatively impacted our gross margins for those products 
by mid  some suppliers had re tooled their manufacturing facilities to increase production capacity of coq  and more competitors entered the market to produce it  which has caused supply to increase and purchase prices to decline to pre levels 
there is no assurance that other raw materials might not be similarly adversely affected in the future 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs  and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
we conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products  but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because we are highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety  and quality of our products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  we could be adversely affected in the event that those products prove or be asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors 
as a manufacturer  we may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  we have not been a party to any product liability litigation  although  like any dietary supplement company  we have received reports from individuals who have asserted that they suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products 
the number of reports we have received to date is nominal 
these matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance  which we believe to be adequate for our needs  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate 
our business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
most of our products are not protected by patents 
the labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products  as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and the interactions among various substances 
in this respect  we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer  and more effective formulations of our products 
we protect our investment in research  as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products  by relying on trade secret laws 
we have also entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  we endeavor to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for our products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada  and in many of the other countries in which we are either presently operating or plan to commence operations in the future 
notwithstanding our efforts  as described above  there can be no assurance that these efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of the intellectual proprietary rights 
if an infringement claim is asserted  we may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis  or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our infringing products 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or operating results 
there can be no assurance that third party claims will not in the future adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
we manufacture approximately of the products sold to our customers 
as a result  we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities in salt lake city  and draper  utah 
those operations are subject to power failures  the breakdown  failure  or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste  and other toxic and hazardous materials 
our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures by us that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations  and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities  or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the nutritional supplement industry  negative publicity  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have  in certain cases  not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
we may incur liability under our athlete guarantee program  if and to the extent participating athletes make a successful claim against usana for testing positive for certain banned substances while taking usana nutritional supplements 
usana believes that its nutritional supplement products are free from substances that have been banned by world class training and competitive athletic programs 
the company retains independent testing agencies to conduct periodic checks for banned substances 
the company further believes that  while its products promote good health  they are not otherwise considered to be performance enhancing as that term has been used in defining substances that are banned from use in international competition by the world anti doping agency wada 
for many years  usana has been a sponsor of olympic athletes and professional competitors around the world 
these athletes have been tested on many occasions and have never tested positive for banned substances as a result of taking usana nutritional products 
to back up its claim that athletes who use the company s products as part of their training regimen will not be consuming banned substances  the company has offered to enter into agreements with select athletes  some of whom have high profiles and are highly compensated  which state that  during the term of the agreement  should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in the wada  and should such positive result be the result of taking usana nutritional products  usana will compensate that athlete two times their current annual earnings up to one million dollars  based on the athlete s personal level of competition  endorsement  and other income  as well as other factors 
to mitigate potential exposure under these agreements  we designate lots identified as dedicated to the program and retain additional samples  store designated lot samples externally with a third party  and establish a chain of custody that requires signatures on behalf of usana and the third party to transfer possession of the product lots and that restricts access by usana employees after the transfer 
all applicants to this athlete guarantee program are subject to screening and acceptance by the company in its sole discretion 
contracts are tailored to fit the athlete s individual circumstances and the amount of the company s exposure is limited based on the level of sponsorship of the participating athlete 
although the company believes that the pool of current and potential participants in the program is small  there is no guarantee that an athlete who is accepted in the program will not successfully make a claim against us 
the company currently has no insurance to protect it from potential claims under this program

barry minkow and fraud discovery institute  inc on march   usana commenced this action against barry minkow and his company  the fraud discovery institute  in the united states district court  district of utah  central division  claiming that the defendants engaged in activity resulting in defamation  business disparagement  and other claims for relief 
usana amended the complaint in june to include claims under federal law and california state law that defendant s activity resulted in fraudulent stock manipulation and dropped the claim of defamation 
on august  the court approved our motion for expedited discovery as to the identity of other participants in this alleged manipulation  and we will add them as defendants to the suit  as appropriate 
on september   the defendants filed their response to our initial complaint and petitioned the court to dismiss the case or  in the alternative  transfer the venue to the state of california 
we subsequently filed our response and requested that the case remain in the state of utah 
in december  the court denied the motion to transfer venue 
in march  the court denied the defendant s motion to dismiss usana s federal stock manipulation claim  but dismissed usana s state law claims 
the court s ruling also overturned a previous decision awarding the defendants expedited discovery against usana 
we will continue to aggressively pursue this litigation 
consolidated shareholder class action lawsuit case no 
cvdak during  three shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court  district of utah  central division  against the company  myron w 
wentz  our chief executive officer  david a 
wentz  our president  and gilbert a 
fuller  our chief financial officer 
these lawsuits were prompted by the allegations against the company by barry minkow 
by order dated october   the court consolidated these three lawsuits into one action and appointed the lead plaintiff and counsel for the class 
the consolidated amended complaint claims  among other things  that we violated sections b and a and sec rule b under the exchange act by knowingly or recklessly failing to make certain statements that the plaintiffs allege should have been made  including statements regarding the multi level marketing industry and anti pyramid laws  sustainability of our marketing plan  associate sales to end user customers  and associate turnover  income  and profitability 
plaintiffs assert that because of such alleged omissions  our statements about our future business prospects were lacking in a reasonable basis and that our reported results and financial statements were misstated 
these complaints seek damages  pre judgment interest  costs  attorney s fees  and other further relief deemed appropriate by the court 
we believe these claims are distorted  ignore the documented history of public disclosures by the company on the very subjects allegedly omitted  are not actionable under established interpretations of sections b and a of the exchange act  and are without merit 
in december  we filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit 
plaintiffs filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss and the court has ordered a hearing on the motion in april we will continue to vigorously defend the company and related defendants in this action 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operation 
larson on behalf of usana health sciences  inc v 
certain officers and directors of usana on september   a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the third judicial district court of salt lake county  state of utah  against certain of our present and former directors and officers 
this lawsuit was also prompted by the allegations against the company by barry minkow 
the derivative complaint contained allegations similar to those asserted in the shareholder class action litigation described above and asserted that  as a result of such allegations  the defendant directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties of good faith and loyalty to the company and were unjustly enriched 
similar to the shareholder class action  we believed the claims in the derivative complaint were distorted  not actionable under applicable law  and without merit 
consequently  we filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit during the fourth quarter of in december  the plaintiff offered to withdraw the lawsuit rather than respond to our motion to dismiss 
on december   the court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice 
johnson vs 
usana in june  two former associates filed a class action lawsuit against usana in state court in san diego  california 
the proposed class consists of distributors who were california residents at any time since the complaint alleges a number of purported material misrepresentations to the market in violation of state pyramid  deceptive business practices  and business fraud law based on some of the same facts alleged in the shareholder class action 
this lawsuit was also prompted by the allegations against the company by barry minkow 
on september   we filed our answer to the complaint  which contained a general denial of the allegations in the complaint and set forth our affirmative defenses 
plaintiffs and usana have stipulated to an agreement  which entails usana producing a limited amount of discovery beginning in february  subject to a confidentiality agreement 
similar to the shareholder class action  we believe the claims in this complaint are distorted  not actionable under applicable law  and without merit 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that this litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operation 
informal inquiry by the united states securities and exchange commission during the first quarter of  we received notification from the sec  salt lake district office  that it had begun an informal inquiry regarding the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and manufacture high quality nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system  which is a form of direct selling 
our customer base comprises two types of customer  associates and preferred customers 
associates are independent distributors of our products who also purchase our products for their personal use 
preferred customers purchase our products strictly for their personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products 
our results of operations and financial condition are directly related to the recruitment and retention of associates and preferred customers 
we believe that our high quality products and our financially rewarding compensation plan are the key components to attracting and retaining associates 
additionally  we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year  which offer information about our products and our network marketing system 
these meetings are designed to assist associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with successful associates and members of the usana management team 
we also provide low cost sales tools  which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home based business for associates 
in addition to company sponsored meetings and sales tools  we maintain a website exclusively for our associates where they can keep up on the latest usana news  obtain training materials  manage their personal information  enroll new customers  shop  and register for company sponsored events 
additionally  through this website  associates can access other online services to which they may subscribe 
for example  we offer an online business management service  which includes a tool that helps associates track and manage their business activity  a personal webpage to which their prospects or retail customers can be directed  e cards for advertising  and a tax management tool

for purposes of this report  we only count as active those associates and preferred customers who have purchased product from usana at any time during the most recent three month period 
during the years presented  changes in net sales were not significantly affected by product price changes  rather  they were affected by increased product sales volume resulting from an increasing number of associates and preferred customers

cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance  and overhead costs that are directly associated with the production and distribution of our products and sales materials  as well as duties and taxes that are associated with the import and export of products 
as our international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales are increasingly affected by additional duties  freight  and other factors  such as changes in foreign currency 
associate incentive expenses represent our most significant expense at of net sales in associate incentives include commissions and leadership bonuses that are paid weekly  based on group sales volume points 
compensation paid to our associates for promotions and contests are also reported as a component of associate incentives 
products are assigned a sales volume point value that is independent of the product s price 
associates earn commissions based on sales volume points that are generated in their downline organization 
items such as our starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value  and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items 
although insignificant to our financial statements  an associate may earn commissions on sales volume points that are generated from personal purchases that are not considered to be part of their qualifying purchases 
qualifying purchases are the amount of product that associates must purchase each month  which they must either resell to consumers or personally use in order to qualify to earn commissions or bonuses under usana s compensation plan 
commissions paid to an associate on personal purchases are considered a sales discount and are reported as a reduction to our net sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  associate events  advertising  and professional fees  along with other marketing and administrative expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of investments in physical facilities  computer and telecommunications equipment  and systems to support international expansion 
we anticipate that additional capital investments will be required in future periods to promote and support our anticipated growth in sales and customers 
research and development expenses include costs incurred in developing new products  enhancing existing products  and in formulating products for introduction into international markets 
sales to customers outside the united states are made in the respective local currencies and are translated to us dollars at weighted average currency exchange rates for the period 
most of our raw material purchases from suppliers and our product purchases from third party manufacturers are transacted in us dollars 
consequently  our sales and net earnings may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates  with sales and earnings generally increasing with a weakening us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales  respectively  for the periods indicated fiscal year consolidated statements of earnings data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses associate incentives selling  general  and administrative research and development total operating expenses earnings from continuing operations other income  net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net earnings summary of financial results and developments fiscal marked the sixth consecutive year of net sales and earnings growth for usana  with net sales increasing nearly to million and with income from continuing operations increasing to million 
overall sales growth during the year can be attributed to an increased number of active associates who purchased our products 
additionally  in january  we began operations in malaysia  which contributed million to net sales for the year 
also  during  we benefited from changes in foreign currency  which added million to net sales for the full year 
the increase in income from continuing operations can be attributed in large part to increased net sales and to improved gross profit margin  which were offset partially by higher operating costs 
during fiscal  we held our second asia pacific convention in sydney  australia  as well as our th annual international convention in salt lake city  utah 
at our international convention  we introduced myhealthpak  a new  customizable packaging system for our supplement products that allows customers to create personalized selections of nutritional supplements in daily am and pm pillow packs 
myhealthpak is currently available only to us and canadian customers 
because myhealthpak is simply a new packaging system of the bottled products that many customers currently consume  we expect that sales of this product will increase gradually as customers begin to see the benefits of custom pillow packs and consume their existing supplies of bottled products 
also  during the year  we sold our third party contract manufacturing business  which resulted in operations for the contract manufacturing segment being accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no

we retained the assets that are associated with manufacturing and packaging our sense skin and beauty care products and will continue to manufacture these products 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the following table summarizes the changes in our net sales by geographic region for the fiscal years ended december  and december  net sales by region in thousands year ended change from prior year percent change north america    southeast asia pacific    east asia    north asia   north america 
net sales in north america  our largest region  increased million  or  in  compared with this growth consisted of modest growth in our most mature market  the united states  of  strong growth in mexico of  and growth in canada  much of which came from changes in foreign currency  resulting in a benefit of approximately million 
sales growth in this region  however  was adversely affected by various false allegations against the company that were disseminated in the mass media 
we believe these challenges are now largely behind us 
during  we plan to implement several new associate related initiatives that are designed to regain our momentum in this region 
southeast asia pacific 
net sales in southeast asia pacific increased million  or  in  compared with this growth was bolstered by the opening of our malaysia market in january  which contributed million in net sales during the year 
also contributing to growth in this region during were changes in foreign currency  which resulted in a benefit of approximately million  most of which came from australia new zealand 
although malaysia added significantly to net sales in this region  we believe that a portion of the sales generated in malaysia would have otherwise been generated in existing markets within this region  as well as in the north asia and east asia regions  due to the seamless nature of our compensation plan 
east asia 
net sales in east asia increased million  or  in  compared with this growth included strong growth in hong kong of to million  and modest growth in taiwan of to million 
sales growth in this region was largely driven by an increase in the number of active associates in this region 
north asia 
net sales in north asia decreased thousand  or  in  compared with this decline was due to a decrease in south korea sales to million 
net sales in this region continue to be soft due to the lack of associate leadership 
a strategic decision was made during mid to reorganize our internal reporting structure with our vice president of east asia now having oversight in this region 
we believe this change will help bolster trust with our associate leadership and foster growth in this region 
gross profit gross profit increased to of net sales in from in this improvement in gross profit margin can be attributed to reduced inventory scrap of about million  and lower relative freight costs on shipments to our customers 
also contributing to the improvement in gross profit was a reduction of sales of the edition of success from home magazine that features the company which were sold at cost and included free shipping during the third and fourth quarters of 
associate incentives associate incentives were slightly higher during  at of net sales  compared with in this increase is the result of a higher payout of base compensation plan commissions  which was partially offset by reduced amounts spent on contests and promotions relative to selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from in in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in by million 
this increase  both as a percentage of net sales and in absolute terms  can be attributed to the following wage related increases of million  which includes a strategic initiative to hire additional employees to add bench strength  and additional wages expense related to malaysia  and increased equity compensation expense  a million increase in spending to support growing sales and an increased number of customers  which includes million spent to support our malaysia market that commenced operations in january  and legal and other professional services of million that related to defending false allegations against the company that were disseminated in the mass media 
other income other income decreased from million in to thousand in this decrease can largely be attributed to an increase in interest expense  resulting from our line of credit  of thousand net of thousand related to funds borrowed for the expansion of our corporate and australia facilities  which was capitalized 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  interest income also decreased due to lower cash balances and to lower foreign currency gains 
income taxes income taxes totaled of earnings before income taxes in  compared with in this change was due to the complete phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion eie  which provided an effective tax rate reduction of in in  the complete eie phase out was partially offset by tax benefits from a deduction for qualified production activities  a favorable adjustment due to the expiration of statutes of limitations on uncertain tax positions  and favorable tax return adjustments 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations increased to million in  which is an increase of million from million in this increase is due primarily to increased net sales and an improved gross profit margin  which were offset partially by higher operating costs

the overall year over year change in this region comprised a decrease in sales in japan to million  and a increase in sales in south korea to million 
gross profit gross profit decreased slightly to of net sales in from in this decrease can be attributed primarily to the following higher freight costs on shipments to customers  the required inclusion of equity based compensation expense  and additional costs relating to our promotions on the success from home magazine  which included selling them to our associates at cost and offering free shipping on packs of magazines when such orders were placed on our monthly product subscription program known as autoship 
this increase was partially offset by lower costs on certain key raw materials  such as coenzyme q associate incentives expenses related to associate incentives represent our most significant cost as a percentage of net sales 
associate incentives increased to of net sales in  compared with in this increase can be primarily attributed to an increase in amounts paid on incentive promotions  including higher paying contests and promotions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from in this increase  as a percentage of net sales  can be attributed largely to the recognition of equity based compensation expense  the selling  general and administrative portion of which totaled of net sales in this increased cost  as a percentage of sales  was partially offset by modest operating leverage that resulted from our growing sales base 
in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million from to this absolute increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can  in great part  be attributed to the following increased spending of million including that related to supporting growth in our existing markets as well as our international expansion efforts mostly in malaysia  which totaled thousand  and expensing of equity based compensation of million  other income other income increased to million in from thousand in this improvement can be attributed to foreign currency gains

because our products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we are highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality  and efficacy of our products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more of our products or of other products that are similar to our products could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  quarterly revenues  expenses  and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues in future periods or be able to sustain the level of revenue or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis that we have sustained in the past 
due to the foregoing factors  future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurred  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including funding for the expansion of our operations  through net cash flows that have been provided by our operating activities and have periodically utilized our line of credit in doing so 
our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flows  the availability of which is directly affected by variations in the sales of our products 
there are no material restrictions on our ability to transfer and remit funds among our international subsidiaries 
in  net cash flows from operating activities totaled million  compared with million in cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december   from million at december  net working capital decreased to million at december   compared with million at december  most of this decrease resulted from the drop in cash and cash equivalents 
during  much of our cash flows from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents  as well as amounts available under our line of credit  were utilized to purchase shares of our common stock under the company s share repurchase plan  totaling million 
additionally  million was spent on property and equipment  including costs for the expansion of our corporate headquarters in salt lake city  utah  as well as a portion of the purchase  remodel  and fit out of a new facility in sydney  australia  both of which are discussed further below 
we are expanding our corporate headquarters and anticipate that this expansion will involve a total investment of approximately million  an increase from the million estimate that we provided in our form k 
this increase is primarily due to a further increase in the scope of the expansion  as well as to continuing increases in the cost of materials 
as of december   billings on this expansion totaled million  of which million was paid and of which million was accrued for work performed through december  we have purchased a facility in sydney  australia  and we expect to move our australian operations to this new facility in mid we anticipate that the purchase  remodel  and fit out of this facility will require a total investment of approximately million  an increase from the million estimate that we provided in our form k 
this increase is due to a further increase in the scope of the remodel and fit out 
as of december   billings on this facility  including the remodel and fit out  totaled million  of which million was paid and of which million was accrued for work performed through december  during the quarter ended june   our million credit facility was amended  increasing the line of credit to million 
as of december   our outstanding balance on this line of credit was million 
this balance primarily consists of amounts that we have used to expand our facilities in salt lake city  utah  and in sydney  australia  as well as to fund share repurchases and retirements 
the credit agreement relating to our line of credit contains restrictive covenants that are based on ebitda and a specified debt coverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
this credit agreement also contains other covenants which are customary for a financing transaction  including a covenant that requires us to comply in all material respects with all laws applicable to us  with which we believe we were in compliance as of december  we believe that current cash balances  cash provided by operations  and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to cover our capital needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future 
if we experience an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
no assurance can be given  however  that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
we might also require or seek additional financing for the purpose of expanding new markets  growing our existing markets  or for other reasons 
such financing may include the sale of additional equity securities 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to our existing shareholders 
we believe that the future investments in our corporate headquarters  as well as in the new facility in australia  will be funded with cash flows generated from operations  and  to the extent necessary  with our line of credit 
our total investments in property  plant  and equipment in are expected to be between and million  including the aforementioned facilities

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements herein 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
those estimates and assumptions are derived and are continually evaluated based on our historical experiences  current facts and circumstances  and on changes in the business environment 
actual results  however  may sometimes differ materially from estimates under different conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most subjective judgments 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized at the estimated point of delivery of the merchandise  at which point the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
sab specifies that revenue is realizable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
we require cash or credit card payment prior to shipping and do not extend credit to customers 
payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities 
a provision for product returns and allowances is established and is founded on our historical experience 
in accordance with emerging issues task force no  accounting of shipping and handling fees and costs  amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as revenue 
in accordance with the guidelines of emerging issues task force no  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  commissions paid to an associate on his or her own orders are captured and reported as a reduction to net sales in the form of a sales discounts 
management estimates  based on the structure of usana s compensation plan  that an associate who places an order with sales volume points in a personal sales position will eventually be paid commission on that purchase 
such reduction of revenue for associates outside of the united states is converted to us dollars at the average currency exchange rate for the period 
we collect an annual renewal fee from our associates that is deferred when it is collected and is recognized as income on a straight line basis over the subsequent twelve month period 
allowance for inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor  and overhead 
an allowance for inventory valuation is maintained and is based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
to estimate the allowance  various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning  and market conditions 
a change in any of these variables could result in additional reserves 
valuation of goodwill and impairment analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair market value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  however it is tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
we use a two step approach to test for impairment 
the first step involves testing for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair values of reporting units 
we determine the fair value of reporting units that we have acquired using widely accepted valuation methods  including both a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach involves judgment when considering the appropriateness of comparable entities and the use of related multiples to determine fair value in terms of operating activities  size  and scope 
the income approach requires the use of estimates and assumptions in projecting future operating results and related cash flows 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one  less fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the acquired subsidiaries for the year ended december  accounting for income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences for items treated differently for tax and financial reporting 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
additional information is available in note e to the consolidated financial statements herein 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the required accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not 
fin also provides guidance on the measurement  classification  and disclosure of tax return positions in the financial statements 
fin was effective for the company s first quarterly reporting period in the impact of adopting fin was not material 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year  and we record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated effective rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this estimation process periodically results in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
equity based compensation 
we calculate equity based compensation expense using the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  equity based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
for more information regarding the assumptions and estimates used in calculating this equity based compensation expense  see note l to the consolidated financial statements herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our foreign operations 
net sales  earnings from operations  and net earnings are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other uncertainties that are inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks that are associated with changes in social  political  and economic conditions in our foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  to changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
foreign currency risks 
net sales outside the united states represented   and of our net sales in   and respectively 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  with all revenue and expenses being translated at weighted average currency exchange rates for the applicable periods 
in general  our reported sales and earnings are affected positively by a weakening of the us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect that these fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
we seek to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our strategy in this regard includes entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage currency fluctuations in our expected net cash flow from certain of our international markets  which are primarily represented by intercompany cash transfers 
more specifically  we purchase put options  which give us the right  but not the obligation  to sell foreign currency at a specified exchange rate strike price 
these contracts provide protection in the event that the foreign currency weakens beyond the option strike price 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on period end quoted market prices  and the resulting asset and expense  which historically has not been material  is recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
at various periods throughout  we had contracts in place to offset our exposure to the canadian dollar  new zealand dollar  new taiwan dollar  and the mexican peso  none of which  individually or in the aggregate  had a material affect on our results of operations 
as of december   we had no contracts in place to offset exposure to foreign currencies 
there can be no assurance that our practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks that may be encountered in connection with our foreign currency transactions 
following are the average exchange rates of foreign currency units to one us dollar for each of our foreign markets for fiscal years   and year ended canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar hong kong dollar japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won  singapore dollar mexican peso chinese yuan malaysian ringitt the chinese yuan exchange rate represents the average for the first three months of operations of our chinese manufacturing facility  which we acquired in october usana operations had not commenced during period indicated 
interest rate risks 
as of december   we had a balance of million outstanding on our line of credit  with a weighted average interest rate of 
this interest rate is computed at the bank s prime rate  or libor  adjusted by features specified in our loan agreements  with fixed rate term options of up to six months 
the annual impact on after tax expense of a basis point increase in the interest rate on the above balance would not materially affect our earnings
